# Getting Started with HealthSystems Platform

## Welcome!

The HealthSystems Platform helps you understand how structural interventions (like housing policy, labor laws, or environmental regulations) affect health outcomes in your community.

## Who is this for?

- **Community organizers**: Plan interventions, secure funding, educate stakeholders
- **Researchers**: Analyze structural determinants, generate hypotheses
- **Health departments**: Inform policy priorities, evaluate programs
- **Foundations**: Assess grant opportunities, measure impact
- **Consultants**: Build custom analyses, generate reports

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Define Your Geography

Select the community you want to analyze:
- Enter city, county, or ZIP code
- Platform automatically fetches demographic, economic, and environmental data

### 2. Explore Mechanisms

Browse the mechanism bank:
- **Built environment**: Housing, transportation, parks
- **Social environment**: Social cohesion, discrimination, crime
- **Economic**: Employment, wages, benefits
- **Political**: Policies, governance, civic participation

Each mechanism shows:
- Effect size and confidence interval
- Evidence quality (A/B/C)
- Key research citations

### 3. View Your Systems Map

Interactive network diagram shows:
- How interventions connect to health outcomes
- Mechanism weights customized to your geography
- Confidence in each pathway

Navigate:
- Click nodes to see details
- Drag to rearrange
- Zoom in/out

### 4. Test Scenarios

Ask "what if" questions:
- What if we improved housing quality by 20%?
- How would a minimum wage increase affect health?
- Which intervention has the biggest impact?

### 5. Generate Reports

Export findings:
- PDF reports for stakeholders
- Data files for further analysis
- Citations for grant proposals

## Key Concepts

### Structural Determinants

Policies and systems that shape where people live, work, and play.

**Examples:**
- Zoning laws that segregate by income
- Labor policies that set wages and benefits
- Environmental regulations on air quality

### Mechanisms

Pathways connecting interventions to health.

**Example:**
```
Minimum wage ↑
  → Income ↑
  → Food security ↑
  → Nutrition ↑
  → Diabetes risk ↓
```

### Bayesian Weighting

We combine:
1. **Research evidence**: What studies show
2. **Your context**: Demographics, environment, economy

Result: Mechanism weights tailored to your community, not generic averages.

### Uncertainty

All estimates include confidence intervals because:
- Research has limitations
- Contexts vary
- Future is uncertain

We show uncertainty explicitly so you can make informed decisions.

## Navigation

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Community Needs Assessment

1. Enter your community geography
2. Review top health challenges (from CDC data)
3. Explore mechanisms affecting those outcomes
4. Identify intervention opportunities
5. Export findings for stakeholders

### Workflow 2: Grant Proposal

1. Define intervention you want to fund
2. Trace pathways to health outcomes
3. Note effect sizes and evidence quality
4. Export citations and evidence summary
5. Include systems map in proposal

### Workflow 3: Policy Evaluation

1. Select policy area (housing, labor, environment)
2. Compare mechanisms affected by policy
3. Test scenarios (before/after policy change)
4. Estimate population health impact
5. Export analysis for decision-makers

## Tips for Success

### Do's

✓ Start with a specific geography
✓ Review evidence quality ratings
✓ Pay attention to confidence intervals
✓ Test multiple scenarios
✓ Export citations for your work

### Don'ts

✗ Don't ignore uncertainty
✗ Don't assume all contexts are the same
✗ Don't treat C-quality evidence as definitive
✗ Don't oversimplify complex systems
✗ Don't forget to cite the platform and underlying research

## Data Privacy

- No personal health data is collected
- Only aggregate, public data is used
- Your analyses are private by default
