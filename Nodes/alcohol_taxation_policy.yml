unit: "Excise tax per standard drink (USD)"

description: |
  State and federal excise taxes on alcoholic beverages. Higher taxes increase
  prices and reduce consumption, particularly among price-sensitive populations
  (youth, heavy drinkers). One of the most cost-effective policy levers for
  reducing alcohol-related harms.

measurement_method: |
  - State alcohol tax statutes
  - Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) database
  - Tax Foundation compilations

typical_range: "$0.02-$1.50 per standard drink (varies by state and beverage type)"

baseline_us: |
  Federal excise taxes (2023):
  - Beer: $0.05 per 12 oz
  - Wine: $0.07 per 5 oz glass
  - Spirits: $0.13 per 1.5 oz shot

  State excise taxes vary widely (e.g., Wyoming: $0.02/beer, Tennessee: $1.29/spirits per gallon)

policy_variation: |
  - 17 states have not increased alcohol taxes since 1990 (erosion due to inflation)
  - Some states adjust annually for inflation
  - Differential rates for beer, wine, spirits
  - Local option taxes in select jurisdictions

evidence_for_effectiveness: |
  - 10% increase in alcohol tax → 3-5% reduction in consumption
  - 5-10% reduction in alcohol-related mortality
  - Greatest impact on youth and heavy drinkers
  - Cost-benefit ratio: $2-6 return per $1 invested (public health costs averted)

limitations: |
  - Does not capture informal economy (home brewing, cross-border purchases)
  - Inflation erodes real tax burden over time
  - Political resistance to tax increases
