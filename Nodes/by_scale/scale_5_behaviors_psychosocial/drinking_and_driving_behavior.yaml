description: 'Percentage of adults who report driving a vehicle within 2 hours of drinking alcohol

  in the past 30 days. Alcohol-impaired driving is a leading cause of motor vehicle

  crash deaths, responsible for approximately 30% of all traffic fatalities (>10,000/year).

  Despite decades of prevention efforts, impaired driving remains common. Risk factors

  include binge drinking, young age, male sex, rural residence, and occupations with

  driving requirements. Ride-sharing services and improved public transit have reduced

  impaired driving in some markets.'
