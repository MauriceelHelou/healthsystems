description: |-
  Percentage of individuals meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder who sought
  any form of help in the past year, including formal treatment (outpatient, residential),
  mutual aid (AA, SMART Recovery), or informal support (clergy, counselor). Only about
  7-8% of those with AUD receive treatment in any given year, representing a massive
  treatment gap. Barriers to help-seeking include stigma, denial, lack of awareness
  of problem severity, cost, and perceived ineffectiveness of treatment. Reducing
  stigma and increasing awareness are key to improving this behavioral indicator.
