description: |-
  Percentage of adults (18+) who engaged in heavy alcohol use in the past 30 days.
  Heavy alcohol use is defined as binge drinking on 5 or more days in the past month.
  This pattern indicates regular excessive consumption beyond occasional binge episodes
  and represents higher risk for developing alcohol use disorder and chronic health
  consequences. Heavy alcohol use is associated with liver disease, cardiovascular
  problems, cancer risk, and neurocognitive impairment. This is a key behavioral
  risk factor at the individual level.
