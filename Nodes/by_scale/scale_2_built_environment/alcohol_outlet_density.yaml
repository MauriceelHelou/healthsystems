description: |-
  Physical count of licensed alcohol retail establishments per 10,000 population including both
  off-premise outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores, grocery stores, NAICS 4453) and on-premise
  outlets (bars, restaurants, clubs, NAICS 7224/7225). Higher outlet density consistently associated
  with increased alcohol consumption, alcohol-related violence, motor vehicle crashes, and health
  disparities. Outlet density is often higher in low-income and minority neighborhoods, contributing
  to health inequities. This is a key built environment exposure for alcohol-related harm.
