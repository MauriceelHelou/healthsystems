description: 'Density of alcohol advertising in the physical environment including outdoor billboards,

  bus shelter ads, storefront signage, transit advertising, and point-of-sale displays.

  Measures the built environment characteristic of advertising saturation, not individual

  exposure. Research consistently shows higher alcohol advertising density in low-income

  neighborhoods and communities of color. This is a standalone environmental measure;

  relationships to consumption or health outcomes are captured in mechanisms.'
