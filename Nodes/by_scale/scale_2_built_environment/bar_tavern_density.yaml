description: |-
  Density of on-premise drinking establishments (bars, taverns, pubs, nightclubs) per geographic
  area, specifically measuring venues whose primary business is alcohol sales for on-site consumption.
  Distinct from restaurants that serve alcohol. Higher bar density is associated with increased
  binge drinking, alcohol-related assaults, and impaired driving incidents. Entertainment districts
  with high bar concentration are hotspots for alcohol-related emergency department visits.
  Spatial clustering creates multiplicative effects on alcohol-related harms.
