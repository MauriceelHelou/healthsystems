description: 'Institutional measure of the percentage of employers offering Employee Assistance Programs

  (EAPs) that provide confidential assessment, short-term counseling, and referral services.

  This is a standalone measure of workplace infrastructure availability, not individual access

  or utilization. EAPs serve as an early intervention resource; relationships between EAP

  availability and health outcomes are captured in mechanisms. Services typically include

  assessment, crisis intervention, 3-8 counseling sessions, and referral to specialized treatment.'
