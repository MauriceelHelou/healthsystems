description: 'Density of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and other twelve-step

  fellowship meetings available per week. AA is the most widely available mutual aid resource

  for alcohol use disorder recovery, with an estimated 2 million members in 115,000+ US groups.

  Research shows AA participation is associated with improved abstinence outcomes, comparable

  to professional treatment. Meeting availability provides free, accessible, ongoing peer support

  infrastructure. Rural areas often have limited meeting options, though online meetings have

  expanded access since COVID-19.'
