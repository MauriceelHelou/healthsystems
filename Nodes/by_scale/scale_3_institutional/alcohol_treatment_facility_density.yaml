description: |-
  Density of substance use disorder treatment facilities that provide services for alcohol use
  disorder including outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient programs (IOP), partial
  hospitalization, and residential treatment. Measured from SAMHSA's annual census of all
  known treatment facilities. Low facility density creates geographic barriers to treatment
  access, particularly in rural areas where individuals may need to travel 50+ miles for
  specialized AUD treatment. Facility availability is a necessary but not sufficient
  condition for treatment access.
