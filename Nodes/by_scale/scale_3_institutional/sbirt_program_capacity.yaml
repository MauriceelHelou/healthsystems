description: 'Implementation capacity for Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT)

  programs in healthcare settings. SBIRT is an evidence-based approach using validated screening

  tools (AUDIT, AUDIT-C) to identify unhealthy alcohol use, deliver brief motivational interventions

  for at-risk drinkers, and refer those with AUD to specialized treatment. Recommended by USPSTF

  for all adults. Implementation barriers include lack of reimbursement, time constraints, and

  insufficient training. SBIRT integration in primary care, emergency departments, and trauma

  centers can identify alcohol problems before they become severe.'
