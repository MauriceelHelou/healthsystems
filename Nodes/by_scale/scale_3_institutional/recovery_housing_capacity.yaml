description: |-
  Capacity of sober living and recovery housing providing substance-free residential environments
  for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder. Includes Oxford Houses (democratically-run,
  self-supporting), certified recovery residences meeting NARR standards, and other sober living
  arrangements. Recovery housing bridges the gap between residential treatment and independent living,
  providing peer support and structure. Stable housing is one of the strongest predictors of sustained
  recovery. Zoning discrimination (treating recovery homes differently than other residences) limits
  availability in many communities.
