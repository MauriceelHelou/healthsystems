description: |-
  Availability of medically supervised alcohol detoxification beds for managing acute alcohol
  withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTs) and withdrawal seizures. Medical detox requires
  24-hour nursing care and physician oversight for benzodiazepine protocols. Severe alcohol
  withdrawal can be life-threatening without medical management. Shortage of detox beds is
  a major bottleneck in the treatment continuum, forcing patients to emergency departments
  or delaying entry to residential treatment programs.
