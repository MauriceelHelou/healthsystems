description: |-
  Density of healthcare providers actively prescribing FDA-approved medications for alcohol
  use disorder: naltrexone (oral and extended-release injectable Vivitrol), acamprosate
  (Campral), and disulfiram (Antabuse). Unlike opioid treatment, these medications do not
  require special waiver or certification. Despite strong evidence, medications for AUD are
  drastically underutilized - only ~9% of those with AUD receive any medication. Barriers
  include provider unfamiliarity, patient preference, lack of integration with behavioral
  treatment, and insufficient insurance coverage.
