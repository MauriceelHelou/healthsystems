description: 'Rate of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) including fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS),

  partial FAS, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), and alcohol-related

  birth defects per 1,000 live births. FASD is the leading preventable cause of

  developmental disabilities and intellectual impairment. Prevalence estimates suggest

  1-5% of children may be affected. FASD causes lifelong cognitive, behavioral, and

  physical impairments with substantial individual, family, and societal costs

  (estimated $2M lifetime cost per case). There is no safe level of alcohol during pregnancy.'
