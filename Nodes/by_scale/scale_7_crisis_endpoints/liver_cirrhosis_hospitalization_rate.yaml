description: |-
  Rate of hospital admissions with primary or secondary diagnosis of liver cirrhosis
  (ICD-10: K74.x, K70.3x). This is a standalone crisis endpoint measuring acute care
  utilization for end-stage liver disease. Cirrhosis has multiple etiologies including
  alcohol, viral hepatitis, and metabolic dysfunction; the specific causal pathways are
  captured in mechanisms. This node represents the aggregate burden of cirrhosis
  hospitalizations regardless of underlying cause.
