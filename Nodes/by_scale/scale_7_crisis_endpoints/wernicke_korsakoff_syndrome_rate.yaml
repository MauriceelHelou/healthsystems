description: |-
  Rate of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS), a severe neurological complication of
  chronic alcoholism caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Wernicke encephalopathy
  is the acute phase (confusion, ataxia, eye movement abnormalities) while Korsakoff
  syndrome is the chronic amnestic phase with permanent memory impairment. Often called
  "wet brain," WKS causes irreversible brain damage in 80%+ of cases. This crisis
  endpoint represents the extreme neurological consequence of long-term heavy drinking.
  Early thiamine supplementation can prevent progression but is often missed in
  clinical settings.
