description: |-
  Percentage of individuals meeting DSM-5 criteria for alcohol use disorder who received
  any form of specialty substance use treatment in the past year. The treatment gap for
  AUD remains enormous - only 7-8% receive treatment despite effective interventions
  existing. This intermediate pathway indicator measures the proportion entering the
  treatment cascade. Treatment includes outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient,
  residential/inpatient, medication-assisted treatment, and hospital-based detox.
  Improving this rate requires addressing stigma, awareness, access, and affordability barriers.
