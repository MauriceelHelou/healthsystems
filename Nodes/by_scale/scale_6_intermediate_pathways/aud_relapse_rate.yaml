description: 'Percentage of individuals who return to heavy drinking or meet AUD criteria within

  one year after completing treatment. Relapse rates for AUD (40-60% within first year)

  are comparable to other chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Factors

  associated with lower relapse include medication use (naltrexone), continued mutual

  aid participation, stable housing, employment, and social support. Viewing relapse

  as a treatment outcome requiring intensification rather than failure is critical.

  Continuing care and recovery support services reduce relapse risk.'
