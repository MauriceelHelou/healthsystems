description: 'Percentage of individuals with a history of alcohol use disorder who have maintained

  abstinence from alcohol for at least one year. Sustained abstinence is associated with

  reduced mortality, improved quality of life, and restored functioning. While many in

  recovery adopt abstinence, others achieve non-problematic moderate drinking. This

  intermediate outcome reflects successful navigation of the recovery process. Abstinence

  rates improve with duration - those with 5+ years have very low relapse rates.

  AA and other mutual aid participation is associated with higher abstinence rates.'
