description: |-
  Percentage of heavy drinkers with elevated alcohol biomarkers including gamma-glutamyl
  transferase (GGT) and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT). These biomarkers provide
  objective evidence of heavy alcohol consumption over the preceding 2-4 weeks, useful
  for screening and monitoring when self-report is unreliable. GGT elevates with regular
  heavy drinking and liver damage. CDT is more specific to heavy drinking. Phosphatidyl-
  ethanol (PEth) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) are newer, more sensitive markers increasingly
  used in treatment monitoring. This intermediate pathway links behavior to biological evidence.
