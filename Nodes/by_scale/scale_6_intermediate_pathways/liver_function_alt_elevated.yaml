description: |-
  Percentage of adults with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels exceeding
  40 U/L, indicating hepatocellular injury. ALT is a sensitive biomarker for liver
  damage from multiple causes including alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
  (NAFLD), viral hepatitis, and medications. Among heavy drinkers, elevated ALT indicates
  early alcoholic liver disease before progression to cirrhosis. This biological pathway
  marker connects alcohol consumption behavior to downstream liver disease outcomes.
  Serial ALT monitoring can detect early liver injury and motivate behavior change.
