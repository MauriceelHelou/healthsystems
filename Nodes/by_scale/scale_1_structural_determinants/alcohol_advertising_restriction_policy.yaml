description: |-
  Measures the restrictiveness of policies regulating alcohol advertising across media channels including
  television, radio, digital, outdoor billboards, and sports sponsorships. Higher scores indicate more
  comprehensive restrictions. The US relies primarily on industry self-regulation through the Beer Institute,
  Distilled Spirits Council, and Wine Institute codes. Some states have additional restrictions on outdoor
  advertising near schools or on public transit. Research links alcohol advertising exposure to earlier
  drinking initiation and increased consumption among youth.
