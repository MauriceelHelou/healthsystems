description: 'Measures the comprehensiveness of Medicaid coverage for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment

  services including: outpatient counseling, intensive outpatient programs (IOP), residential

  treatment, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for alcohol use disorder (naltrexone, acamprosate,

  disulfiram), medical detoxification, and peer support services. Incorporates whether state has

  waiver of IMD (Institutions for Mental Diseases) exclusion allowing Medicaid payment for

  residential treatment. Mental Health Parity requirements mandate comparable SUD coverage to

  medical benefits. Higher scores indicate more comprehensive coverage with fewer barriers.'
