description: |-
  Measures the restrictiveness of state laws governing hours and days of alcohol sales for both
  on-premise (bars, restaurants) and off-premise (liquor stores, grocery) establishments. Includes
  Sunday sales prohibitions (blue laws), late-night/early-morning cutoff times, and holiday
  restrictions. Higher scores indicate more restricted hours. Research shows later closing times
  are associated with increased alcohol consumption, violence, and drunk driving incidents.
  Many states have moved toward liberalization in recent decades.
