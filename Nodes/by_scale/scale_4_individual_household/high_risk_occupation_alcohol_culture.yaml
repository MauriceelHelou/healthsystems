  Percentage of workers employed in occupations characterized by elevated drinking norms
  and alcohol-permissive workplace culture. This is a standalone individual-level condition
  measuring occupational context. High-risk occupations include hospitality, food service,
  construction, mining, military service, and some professional fields. Occupational factors
  include irregular hours, high stress, male-dominated culture, and lack of supervision.
  Relationships to drinking behavior or health outcomes are captured in mechanisms.
