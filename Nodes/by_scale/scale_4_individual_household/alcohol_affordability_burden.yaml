description: 'Percentage of household income allocated to alcohol purchases among heavy drinking

  households. For heavy drinkers in low-income households, alcohol expenditure can

  consume a substantial portion of the budget, crowding out spending on food, housing,

  healthcare, and other necessities. This economic burden contributes to financial

  instability and perpetuates cycles of poverty. Minimum unit pricing policies

  specifically target the cheapest alcohol products to reduce affordability of high

  consumption while minimally affecting moderate drinkers.'
