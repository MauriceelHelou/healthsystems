description: 'Percentage of adults reporting a first-degree biological relative (parent, sibling, child)

  with alcohol use disorder. Family history is one of the strongest risk factors for AUD,

  reflecting both genetic heritability (estimated 50-60% of AUD risk) and shared environmental

  factors. Individuals with family history of AUD are 4-7 times more likely to develop AUD

  themselves. This risk factor is non-modifiable but identifies populations for targeted

  prevention and early intervention. Family history screening is recommended in primary care.'
