  Identify causal mechanisms linking {from_node} to {to_node} in mental health contexts.

  Focus on:
  - Psychosocial stress pathways and chronic adversity
  - Access to mental healthcare and treatment barriers
  - Social support, isolation, and community connection
  - Substance use and maladaptive coping behaviors
  - Socioeconomic adversity (poverty, unemployment, housing instability)
  - Discrimination, racism, and minority stress
  - Neurobiological mechanisms (HPA axis, inflammation, neurotransmitters)
  - Trauma exposure and adverse childhood experiences

  Provide evidence from psychiatric epidemiology, clinical trials, and longitudinal cohort studies.

notes: |
  Mental health is deeply shaped by structural determinants and social adversity.
  Focus on upstream factors: discrimination, poverty, housing, trauma.
  Avoid individual blame - emphasize structural competency and equity lens.
  Consider bidirectional relationships (e.g., mental health <-> substance use).
