  Identify causal mechanisms linking {from_node} to {to_node} in the context of respiratory health and disease.

  Focus on:
  - Airway inflammation and remodeling
  - Environmental exposures (air pollution, allergens, occupational hazards)
  - Infectious respiratory diseases
  - Housing quality and indoor air quality
  - Healthcare access and treatment adherence
  - Behavioral factors (smoking, physical activity)
  - Social determinants (poverty, neighborhood environment)
  - Structural factors (environmental policy, housing policy)

  Provide evidence from respiratory epidemiology, environmental health studies, and clinical trials.

  - 2  # Environmental (air pollution, housing quality)
  - 3  # Institutional (healthcare access)
  - 4  # Individual conditions (asthma, COPD)
  - 5  # Behaviors (smoking, medication adherence)
  - 6  # Intermediate pathways (airway inflammation)
  - 7  # Respiratory outcomes and complications

notes: |
  Respiratory health is strongly influenced by environmental exposures and housing quality.
  Focus on air pollution (outdoor and indoor), housing conditions, and occupational exposures.
  Consider health disparities related to environmental racism and poverty.
