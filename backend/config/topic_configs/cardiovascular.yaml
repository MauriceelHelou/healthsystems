  Identify causal mechanisms linking {from_node} to {to_node} in the context of cardiovascular disease.

  Focus on:
  - Atherosclerosis and thrombosis pathways
  - Blood pressure regulation and hypertension
  - Lipid metabolism and dyslipidemia
  - Inflammation and endothelial dysfunction
  - Healthcare access and treatment adherence
  - Behavioral risk factors (diet, physical activity, smoking)
  - Social determinants (SES, stress, neighborhood environment)
  - Structural factors (healthcare policy, environmental exposures)

  Provide evidence from cardiovascular epidemiology, clinical trials, and meta-analyses.

  - 2  # Environmental (air pollution, neighborhood)
  - 3  # Institutional (healthcare access)
  - 4  # Individual conditions (hypertension, diabetes)
  - 5  # Behaviors (diet, smoking, physical activity)
  - 6  # Intermediate pathways (atherosclerosis, inflammation)
  - 7  # Cardiovascular events and outcomes

notes: |
  Cardiovascular disease has well-established risk factors but also strong social determinants.
  Focus on both biological pathways and structural drivers (SES, healthcare access, environment).
  Consider medication access, treatment adherence, and secondary prevention.
