  Identify causal mechanisms linking {from_node} to {to_node} in the context of type 2 diabetes.

  Focus on:
  - Insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction pathways
  - Glycemic control factors and metabolic dysfunction
  - Healthcare access and treatment adherence
  - Dietary patterns and lifestyle behaviors
  - Social determinants of health (SES, education, discrimination)
  - Structural factors (healthcare policy, food environment)

  Provide evidence from peer-reviewed literature, especially meta-analyses, RCTs, and cohort studies.

  - sleep_quality
  - stress_chronic
  - neighborhood_deprivation
  - healthcare_quality
  - primary_care_access
  - diabetes_education
  - family_history
  - genetic_risk
  - inflammation_systemic
  - built_environment
  - food_environment

scales:
  - 1  # Structural (policy, healthcare system)
  - 2  # Environmental (food, built environment)
  - 3  # Institutional (healthcare access)
  - 4  # Individual conditions (obesity, insulin resistance)
  - 5  # Behaviors (diet, physical activity)
  - 6  # Intermediate pathways (glycemic control)
  - 7  # Complications and outcomes

notes: |
  Type 2 diabetes has strong social determinants and structural drivers.
  Focus on healthcare access, food environment, and socioeconomic context.
  Consider medication access, treatment adherence, and complications prevention.
