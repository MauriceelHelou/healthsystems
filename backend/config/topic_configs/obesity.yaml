topic: obesity

query_template: |
  Identify causal mechanisms linking {from_node} to {to_node} in the context of obesity.

  Focus on:
  - Biological pathways (metabolic, hormonal, appetite regulation)
  - Behavioral factors (diet, physical activity, sedentary behavior)
  - Environmental determinants (food access, built environment, walkability)
  - Socioeconomic influences (income, education, food policy)
  - Structural factors (zoning, transportation, food marketing)

  Provide evidence from peer-reviewed literature, prioritizing meta-analyses and systematic reviews.

  - neighborhood_walkability
  - park_access
  - grocery_store_access
  - fast_food_density
  - housing_quality
  - employment_status
  - food_insecurity
  - stress_chronic
  - sleep_duration
  - physical_activity_norms
  - dietary_norms

to_nodes:
  - obesity_prevalence
  - bmi_continuous
  - metabolic_syndrome
  - cardiovascular_disease
  - type_2_diabetes
  - hypertension
  - dyslipidemia
  - insulin_resistance
  - weight_gain
  - caloric_intake
  - diet_quality
  - physical_activity_level
  - sedentary_time
  - adiposity
  - inflammation_systemic
  - leptin_resistance
  - mortality_all_cause

scales:
  - 1  # Structural (policy, environment)
  - 2  # Built environment
  - 3  # Institutional
  - 4  # Individual conditions
  - 5  # Behaviors
  - 6  # Intermediate pathways
  - 7  # Health outcomes

notes: |
  Obesity is a complex condition with structural, environmental, and biological determinants.
  Focus on upstream structural factors rather than individual blame.
  Consider food systems, built environment, and socioeconomic context.
