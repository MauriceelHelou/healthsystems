    "title": "Effects of Alcohol Taxation on Prices: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Pass-Through Rates",
    "abstract": "Abstract This paper conducts the first review and meta-analysis for estimates of alcohol excise tax pass-through rates. A total of 30 empirical studies are examined. Several widely cited studies indicate substantial overshifting, suggesting imperfectly-competitive markets for alcohol. The narrative review provides insights for data coverage by country; econometric models; and results for under- or overshifting by beverage. Weighted-averages calculated for two samples show that beer taxes are overshifted and wine-spirits taxes are fully shifted. Meta-regressions corrected for publication bias indicate, however, that full-shifting cannot be rejected for any beverage. Results are useful for alcohol tax policy and future research on optimal taxation and incidence.",

    "title": "Why do only some cohort studies find health benefits from low volume alcohol use? A systematic review and meta-analysis of study characteristics that may bias mortality risk estimates.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAssumptions about alcohol's health benefits profoundly influence global disease burden estimates and drinking guidelines. Utilising theory and evidence, we identify and test study characteristics that may bias estimates of all-cause mortality risk associated with low volume drinking.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe identified 107 longitudinal studies by systematic review with 724 estimates of association between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality for 4,838,825 participants with 425,564 recorded deaths. \"Higher quality\" studies had a mean cohort age of \u226455 years, followed-up beyond 55 years, and excluded former and occasional drinkers from abstainer reference groups. \"Low volume\" alcohol use was defined as between one drink per week (>1.30g ethanol/day) and two drinks per day (<25g ethanol/day). Mixed linear regression was used to model relative risks (RRs) of mortality for subgroups of higher versus lower quality studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAs predicted, studies with younger cohorts and separating former and occasional drinkers from abstainers estimated similar mortality risk for low volume drinkers (RR=0.98, 0.87-1.11) as abstainers. Studies not meeting these quality criteria estimated significantly lower risk for low volume drinkers (RR=0.84, 0.79-0.89). In exploratory analyses, studies controlling for smoking and/or socio-economic status had significantly reduced mortality risks for low volume drinkers. However, mean RR estimates for low volume drinkers in non-smoking cohorts were above 1.0 (RR=1.16, 0.91-1.41).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nStudies with lifetime selection biases may create misleading positive health associations. These biases pervade the field of alcohol epidemiology and can confuse communications about health risks. Future research should investigate whether smoking status mediates, moderates or confounds alcohol-mortality risk relationships.",

    "title": "Does the co-use of cannabis exacerbate the effect of alcohol on the risk of crashing? A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "This is the second of two closely related systematic literature reviews with meta-analyses by the same authors. The first concluded that there is no convincing epidemiological evidence that the prior use of cannabis (as indicated by the presence of THC in a body fluid) directly increases the risk of crashing. The purpose of this second review is to consider the possibility that the co-use of cannabis indirectly increases the risk of crashing by exacerbating the effect of alcohol on the risk of crashing. The starting point for both reviews is a systematic literature search that identifies seventeen epidemiological studies of the relationship between the prior use of cannabis and the risk of crashing. Twelve of those studies also investigated the joint effects of cannabis and alcohol on the risk of crashing. Although the authors of some studies claimed to have found an exacerbation (or equivalent) effect, the results of a meta-analysis of exacerbation odds ratios failed to support the claim. It is concluded that there is no credible evidence from the twelve epidemiological studies that the co-use of cannabis exacerbates the effect of alcohol on the risk of crashing.",

    "title": "Tobacco retail availability and smoking-A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "ISSUES\nHealth policy makers worldwide have adopted evidence-based legislation, largely directed at consumers, to reduce tobacco-related harm. It is suggested that limiting supply by decreasing retail availability can also reduce cigarette smoking. To inform policy makers this systematic literature review assesses whether reducing availability is associated with smoking behaviours.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nSystematic literature searches of five databases were carried out up to January 2023. Included studies had at least one exposure (tobacco retail density, proximity or mixed measures thereof) and outcomes of smoking behaviour. Meta-analysis of effect estimates were undertaken if there were at least three studies with similar population, exposure and outcome measures.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nSixty-two studies were included, and positive associations were found between tobacco outlet density and cigarette smoking in pregnancy, youth, adults and cessation. Meta-analyses were undertaken for retail density and ever smoking (odds ratio [OR] 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04, 1.37; I2\u2009=\u200987.3%), and current youth smoking (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.08, 1.40; I2\u2009=\u20090.0%), adult smoking (OR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01, 1.22; I2\u2009=\u200974.8%); and mixed measures of retail availability near schools and current youth smoking (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01, 1.05; I2\u2009=\u20090.0%).\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION\nThere is evidence higher tobacco retail density is consistently associated with cigarette smoking in pregnant women, young people and adults when ecological studies are included in meta-analysis. Meanwhile, evidence synthesis reveals restrictive tobacco retail laws based on proximity or mixed measures near home or very near school may not reduce smoking except in men who smoke heavily. Mechanisms to reduce retailer density should be thus considered part of tobacco control strategies.",

    "title": "Mobile apps to reduce depressive symptoms and alcohol use in youth: A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis: A systematic review",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Among youth, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol use are associated with considerable illness and disability. Youth face many personal and health system barriers in accessing mental health care. Mobile applications (apps) offer youth potentially accessible, scalable, and anonymous therapy and other support. Recent systematic reviews on apps to reduce mental health symptoms among youth have reported uncertain effectiveness, but analyses based on the type of app\u2010delivered therapy are limited. Objectives We conducted this systematic review with youth co\u2010researchers to ensure that this review addressed the questions that were most important to them. The objective of this review is to synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of mobile apps for the reduction of depressive symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety, psychological distress) and alcohol use among youth. Search Methods We conducted electronic searches of the following bibliographic databases for studies published between January 1, 2008, and July 1, 2022: MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), CINAHL (via EBSCOHost), and CENTRAL (via the Cochrane Library). The search used a combination of indexed terms, free text words, and MeSH headings. We manually screened the references of relevant systematic reviews and included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for additional eligible studies, and contacted authors for full reports of identified trial registries or protocols. Selection Criteria We included RCTs conducted among youth aged 15\u201324 years from any setting. We did not exclude populations on the basis of gender, socioeconomic status, geographic location or other personal characteristics. We included studies which assessed the effectiveness of app\u2010delivered mental health support or therapy interventions that targeted the management of depressive disorders and/or alcohol use disorders. We excluded apps that targeted general wellness, apps which focused on prevention of psychological disorders and apps that targeted bipolar disorder, psychosis, post\u2010traumatic stress disorder, attention\u2010deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance use disorders (aside from alcohol), and sleep disorders. Eligible comparisons included usual care, no intervention, wait\u2010list control, alternative or controlled mobile applications. We included studies which reported outcomes on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, alcohol use and psychological distress over any follow\u2010up period. Data Collection and Analysis We standardized the PICO definitions (population, intervention, comparison, and outcome) of each included study and grouped studies by the type of therapy or support offered by the app. Whenever app design and clinical homogeneity allowed, we meta\u2010analyzed outcomes using a random\u2010effects model. Outcome data measured using categorical scales were synthesized using odds ratios. Outcome data measured using continuous scales were synthesized as the standardized mean difference. We assessed the methodological quality of each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool and we assessed certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main Results From 5280 unique citations, we included 36 RCTs published in 37 reports and conducted in 15 different countries (7984 participants). Among the 36 included trials, we assessed two with an overall low risk of bias, 8 trials with some concern regarding risk of bias, and 26 trials with a high risk of bias. Interventions varied in the type of therapy or supports offered. The most common intervention designs employed mindfulness training, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or a combination of the two (mindfulness\u2009+\u2009CBT). However, other interventions also included self\u2010monitoring, medication reminders, cognitive bias modification or positive stimulation, dialectical behavioral therapy, gamified health promotion, or social skill building. Mindfulness apps led to short term improvements in depressive symptoms when compared to a withheld control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.36; 95% CI [\u22120.63, \u22120.10]; p\u2009=\u20090.007, n\u2009=\u20093 RCTs, GRADE: very low certainty) and when compared to an active control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.27; 95% CI [\u22120.53, \u22120.01]; p\u2009=\u20090.04, n\u2009=\u20092 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Apps delivering this type of support also significantly improved symptoms of anxiety when compared to a withheld control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.35; 95% CI [\u22120.60, \u22120.09]; p\u2009=\u20090.008, n\u2009=\u20093 RCTs, GRADE: very low) but not when compared to an active control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.24; 95% CI [\u22120.50, 0.02]; p\u2009=\u20090.07, n\u2009=\u20092 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Mindfulness apps showed improvements in psychological stress that approached statistical significance among participants receiving the mindfulness mobile apps compared to those in the withheld control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.27; 95% CI [\u22120.56, 0.03]; p\u2009=\u2009.07, n\u2009=\u20094 RCTs, GRADE: very low). CBT apps also led to short\u2010term improvements in depressive symptoms when compared to a withheld control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.40; 95% CI [\u22120.80, 0.01]; p\u2009=\u20090.05, n\u2009=\u20092 RCTs, GRADE: very low) and when compared to an active control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.59; 95% CI [\u22120.98, \u22120.19]; p\u2009=\u20090.003, n\u2009=\u20092 RCTs, GRADE: very low). CBT\u2010based apps also improved symptoms of anxiety compared to a withheld control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.51; 95% CI [\u22120.94, \u22120.09]; p\u2009=\u20090.02, n\u2009=\u20093 RCTs, GRADE: very low) but not when compared to an active control (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.26; 95% CI [\u22121.11, 0.59]; p\u2009=\u20090.55, n\u2009=\u20093 RCTs, GRADE: very low). Apps which combined mindfulness and CBT did not significantly improve symptoms of depression (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.20; 95% CI [\u22120.42, 0.02]; p\u2009=\u20090.07, n\u2009=\u20092 RCTs, GRADE: very low) or anxiety (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.21; 95% CI [\u22120.49, 0.07]; p\u2009=\u20090.14, n\u2009=\u20092 RCTs, GRADE: very low). However, these apps did improve psychological distress (SMD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.43; 95% CI [\u22120.74, \u22120.12]; p\u2009=\u20090.006, n\u2009=\u20092 RCTs, GRADE: very low). The results of trials on apps to reduce alcohol use were inconsistent. We did not identify any harms associated with the use of apps to manage mental health concerns. All effectiveness results had a very low certainty of evidence rating using the GRADE approach, meaning that apps which deliver therapy or other mental health support may reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress but the evidence is very uncertain. Authors' Conclusions We reviewed evidence from 36 trials conducted among youth. According to our meta\u2010analyses, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of apps on depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and alcohol use. Very few effects were interpreted to be of clinical importance. Most of the RCTs were small studies focusing on efficacy for youth at risk for depressive symptoms. Larger trials are needed to evaluate effectiveness and allow for further analysis of subgroup differences. Longer trials are also needed to better estimate the clinical importance of these apps over the long term.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis update",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Given the accumulating research, evolving psychosocial treatment, and equivocal findings, updating WHO\u2019s Mental Health Gap Action Programme-2015 was necessary to ensure guidelines reflect effective strategies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Objective: To estimate the effects of psychosocial interventions on drinking and related outcomes. Methods: We included randomized controlled trials published between January 2015 and June 2022 on adults with alcohol dependence (ICD 10/DSM-IV) and moderate to severe AUD (DSM-5), and those examined psychosocial interventions against treatment-as-usual (TAU) and active controls. Eight databases and registries were searched. Relative Risk (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were used for dichotomous and continuous outcomes. We used Cochrane\u2019s risk of bias assessment (RoB2). Results: Of 873 screened records, 14 and 13 studies in the narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Of the 2,575 participants, 71.5% were men. Thirteen studies used ICD 10/DSM IV diagnosis. Compared to TAU, any psychosocial intervention increased the relative risk of abstinence by 28% [N\u2009=\u20097, RR\u2009=\u20091.28, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.53, p\u2009=\u2009.01, NNT\u2009=\u20099]. There were minimal heterogeneity and no evidence of publication bias. Psychosocial interventions were not effective in reducing the drinking frequency (n\u2009=\u20092, Hedge\u2019s g = \u22120.10, 95% CI: \u22120.46 to 0.26, p\u2009=\u2009.57) and drinks/drinking days (N\u2009=\u20095, g = \u22120.10, 95% CI: \u22120.37 to 0.16, p\u2009=\u2009.43). Treatment discontinuation did not differ between intervention and control groups [RR\u2009=\u20091.09, 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.80]. Conclusion: Psychosocial interventions are effective in improving abstinence but not in reducing drinking frequency or amount. Policymakers must consider this evidence to generate AUD treatment guidelines. Registration: PROSPERO 2022 CRD42022342608",

    "title": "Systematic review and meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations on the effectiveness of carbon pricing",
    "abstract": "Today, more than 70 carbon pricing schemes have been implemented around the globe, but their contributions to emissions reductions remains a subject of heated debate in science and policy. Here we assess the effectiveness of carbon pricing in reducing emissions using a rigorous, machine-learning assisted systematic review and meta-analysis. Based on 483 effect sizes extracted from 80 causal ex-post evaluations across 21 carbon pricing schemes, we find that introducing a carbon price has yielded immediate and substantial emission reductions for at least 17 of these policies, despite the low level of prices in most instances. Statistically significant emissions reductions range between \u20135% to \u201321% across the schemes (\u20134% to \u201315% after correcting for publication bias). Our study highlights critical evidence gaps with regard to dozens of unevaluated carbon pricing schemes and the price elasticity of emissions reductions. More rigorous synthesis of carbon pricing and other climate policies is required across a range of outcomes to advance our understanding of \u201cwhat works\u201d and accelerate learning on climate solutions in science and policy. Carbon pricing policies are adopted in many countries around the world to mitigate climate change. This systematic review shows that significant emission reductions of between 5 and 21% are achieved by at least 17 out of 21 reviewed policy schemes.",

For adverse effects, randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that compared drug therapies and reported health outcomes or harms were included.\n\n\nData Extraction and Synthesis\nTwo reviewers evaluated each study, assessed risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Numbers needed to treat were calculated for medications with at least moderate strength of evidence for benefit.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary outcome was alcohol consumption.

    "abstract": "We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analyses (NMA) of psychotherapy and pharmacologic treatments for individuals with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol or other drug use disorder (AOD). A comprehensive search spanning 1995-2019 yielded a pool of 39 studies for systematic review, including 24 randomized controlled trials for the NMA. Study interventions were grouped by target of treatment (PTSD + AOD, PTSD-only, and AOD-only) and approach (psychotherapy or medication). Standardized mean differences (SMD) from the NMA yielded evidence that at the end of treatment, integrated, trauma-focused therapy for PTSD + AOD was more effective at reducing PTSD symptoms than integrated, non-trauma-focused therapy (SMD = -0.30), AOD-focused psychotherapy (SMD = -0.29), and other control psychotherapies (SMD = -0.43). End-of-treatment alcohol use severity was less for AOD medication compared to placebo medication (SMD = -0.36) and trauma-focused therapy for PTSD + placebo medication (SMD = -0.67), and less for trauma-focused psychotherapy + AOD medication compared to PTSD medication (SMD = -0.53), placebo medication (SMD = -0.50), and trauma-focused psychotherapy + placebo medication (SMD = -0.81). Key limitations include the small number of studies in the NMA for pharmacologic treatments and the lack of demographic diversity apparent in the existing literature. Findings suggest room for new studies that can address limitations in study sample composition, sample sizes, retention, and apply new techniques for conducting comparative effectiveness in PTSD + AOD treatment.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Through new publications on the subject, the main goal of this article is to seek a change in the pattern of alcohol use before and after bariatric surgery. Methods We searched the National Library of Medicine, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. We included original articles regarding alcohol consumption before and after bariatric surgery to conduct the systematic review. Results Our systematic review, which included 18 articles, yielded mixed results. Meta-analysis of six articles did not reveal statistically significant differences in alcohol use behaviours before and one year after bariatric surgery. However, throughout the perspective of follow-up after bariatric surgery, nine out of the twelve articles showed improvement in the pattern of alcohol consumption when evaluated up to two years after the end of the surgical period, and four out of the five articles with monitoring beyond two years showed worsening in consumption, compared to pre-surgery alcohol use behaviours. Conclusions Conclusions about the relationship between alcohol consumption and bariatric surgery are challenging primarily because of the variety of the methods used and the alcohol consumption measures. Despite that, our research pointed to an increased risk of alcohol use disorders two years after bariatric surgery.",

    "title": "Digital interventions for reducing alcohol use in general populations: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "This article updates a 2017 review on the effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing alcohol use in the general population. An updated systematic search of the MEDLINE database was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from January 2017 to June 2022 that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no interventions, minimal interventions, and face-to-face interventions aimed at reducing alcohol use in the general population and, that also reported changes in alcohol use (quantity, frequency, quantity per drinking day, heavy episodic drinking (HED), or alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) scores). A secondary analysis was performed that analyzed data from\u00a0RCTs conducted in students. The review was not preregistered. The search produced 2224 articles. A total of 80 studies were included in the review, 35 of which were published after the last systematic review. A total of 66, 20, 18, 26, and 9 studies assessed the impact of digital interventions on alcohol quantity, frequency, quantity per drinking day, HED, and AUDIT scores, respectively. Individuals randomized to the digital interventions drank 4.12 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.88, 5.36) fewer grams of alcohol per day, had 0.17 (95% CI 0.06, 0.29) fewer drinking days per week, drank approximately 3.89 (95% CI: 0.40, 7.38) fewer grams of alcohol per drinking day, had 1.11 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.91) fewer HED occasions per month, and had an AUDIT score 3.04 points lower (95% CI: 2.23, 3.85) than individuals randomized to the control condition. Significant reductions in alcohol quantity, frequency, and HED, but not quantity per drinking day, were observed among students. Digital interventions show potential for reducing alcohol use in general populations and could be used widely at the population level to reduce alcohol-attributable harms.",

    "title": "Alcohol use disorders in patients with bipolar disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Alcohol consumption has a key role in more than 200 diseases and health injuries, being an important factor for social and public health costs. Studies with clinical populations show an association between alcohol use disorders (AUD) and bipolar disorder. In this meta-analysis we included studies, reports, or summaries identified in Google Scholar, Lilacs, Medline, and MedCaribe that reported original data published up to 31 January 2023. We included cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies that investigated the prevalence of AUD in patients with bipolar disorder. We calculated the prevalence rates and conducted a meta-analysis using a random effects model. The meta-analysis included 20 unique studies conducted in 12 countries, with a total sample of 32,886 individuals with bipolar disorder, comprising 17,923 women and 13,963 men, all aged 18\u2009years or older. The prevalence of AUD in individuals with bipolar disorder was found to be 29.12%, while the prevalence of Alcohol Dependence (AD) was 15.87% and the prevalence of Alcohol Abuse (AA) was 18.74%. The high prevalence of AUD individuals with bipolar disorder is important because it highlights the need for targeted interventions to prevent and address comorbid conditions, which may improve treatment outcomes, reduce harm, and promote public health.",

    "abstract": "Background Alcohol consumption during pregnancy represents a significant public health concern. It has several adverse health effects for both the mother and the developing fetus. This study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and the effect size of associated factors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Methods The results of the review were reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement (PRISMA) guideline and, it was registered in the Prospero database, number CRD42019127103. The available primary studies were collated from different databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, African Journals Online and Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Library. The main search terms were [((alcohol consumption) OR (alcohol drinking) OR (alcohol use) OR (ethanol use) OR (alcohol exposure)) AND ((pregnant women) OR (pregnant mother) OR (during pregnancy)) AND (Sub-Saharan Africa)]. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) for critical appraisal of studies. The random-effects model was computed to estimate the pooled prevalence. Heterogeneity between studies was checked using the I 2 statistic and the Cochrane Q test. Results The review resulted in 963 original studies after searching various databases, and finally 37 studies in qualitative synthesis and 30 articles in the systematic review and meta-analysis were included. The overall summary estimate of the prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy was found to be 20.83% (95% CI: 18.21, 23.46). The pooled estimate of meta-analysis showed that depression (OR: 1.572; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.845), partners\u2019 alcohol use (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.57), knowledge on harmful effect of alcohol consumption (OR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.45) and, unplanned pregnancy (OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.63) were statistically significant factors with alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Conclusions The result showed that there was high alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Sub- Saharan Africa. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy was associated with depression, partners\u2019 alcohol use, unplanned pregnancy and knowledge of the harmful effects of alcohol consumption. Therefore, this will be a basis for public policy and resource allocation for prevention initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alcohol consumption is an established cause of female breast cancer. This systematic review examines in detail the association between alcohol and female breast cancer overall and among the described subgroups, using all of the evidence to date. A systematic review of PubMed and Embase was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analyses guidelines. The search included articles published up to November 15, 2023. Meta\u2010analyses and regressions were performed for alcohol consumption of less than 1 standard drink (10\u2009g of ethanol) per day and for a range of alcohol consumption categories in relation to breast cancer. Analyses by menopausal status, hormone receptor status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status, and molecular subtype were performed. The search yielded 5645 publications, of which 23 publications of individual and pooled studies examined the association between overall alcohol consumption and breast cancer incidence. The meta\u2010regression showed a positive association; relative risks (RR) of breast cancer were 1.05 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.06), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.12), 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.21), and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.25) for 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 standard drinks per day compared with nondrinking, respectively. A meta\u2010analysis of nine studies indicated that for consumption of less than one standard drink per day, the RR estimate of breast cancer was 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.07) compared with nondrinking. Consumption of an additional 1 standard drink per day was associated with a higher risk of premenopausal (RR: 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.06)) and postmenopausal (RR: 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.12)) breast cancer. Alcohol consumption increases female breast cancer risk, even for women who consume one drink per day. Furthermore, alcohol consumption is associated with both pre\u2010 and postmenopausal breast cancer risk. These findings support evidence\u2010based cancer prevention guidelines to reduce alcohol\u2010related risks.",

    "title": "Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of disordered and problem gambling.",
    "abstract": "Pharmacological interventions for disordered and problem gambling have been employed in clinical practice. Despite the availability of several reviews of the efficacy of pharmacological interventions for disordered or problem gambling, few have employed systematic search strategies or compared different categories of pharmacological interventions. Systematic reviews of high-quality evidence are therefore essential to provide guidance regarding the efficacy of different pharmacological interventions for disordered or problem gambling. The primary aims of the review were to: (1) examine the efficacy of major categories of pharmacological-only interventions (antidepressants, opioid antagonists, mood stabilisers, atypical antipsychotics) for disordered or problem gambling, relative to placebo control conditions; and (2) examine the efficacy of these major categories relative to each other.\u00a0 SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (all years to 11 January 2022). We included randomised trials evaluating a pharmacological intervention for the treatment of disordered or problem gambling. Eligible control conditions included placebo control groups or comparisons with another category of pharmacological intervention. We used standard methodological procedures, including systematic extraction of included study characteristics and results and risk of bias assessment. Our primary outcome was reduction in gambling symptom severity. Our secondary outcomes were reduction in gambling expenditure, gambling frequency, time spent gambling, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and functional impairment; and responder status. We evaluated treatment effects for continuous and dichotomous outcomes using standardised mean difference (SMD) and risk ratios (RR), respectively, employing random-effects meta-analyses. A minimum of two independent treatment effects were required for a meta-analysis to be conducted (with only meta-analytic findings reported in this abstract). We included 17 studies in the review (n = 1193 randomised) that reported outcome data scheduled for end of treatment. Length of treatment ranged from 7 to 96 weeks.\u00a0 Antidepressants: Six studies (n = 268) evaluated antidepressants, with very low to low certainty evidence suggesting that antidepressants were no more effective than placebo at post-treatment: gambling symptom severity (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.09, n = 225), gambling expenditure (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.06, n = 144), depressive symptoms (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.23, n = 90), functional impairment (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.22, n = 110), and responder status (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.66, n = 268). Opioid antagonists: Four studies (n = 562) evaluated opioid antagonists, with very low to low certainty evidence showing a medium beneficial effect of treatment on gambling symptom severity relative to placebo at post-treatment (SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.19, n = 259), but no difference between groups in responder status (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.14, n = 562). Mood stabilisers: Two studies (n = 71) evaluated mood stabilisers (including anticonvulsants), with very low certainty evidence suggesting that mood stabilisers were no more effective than placebo at post-treatment: gambling symptom severity (SMD -0.92, 95% CI -2.24 to 0.39, n = 71), depressive symptoms (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -1.14 to 0.83, n = 71), and anxiety symptoms (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.30, n = 71). Atypical antipsychotics:Two studies (n = 63) evaluated the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, with very low certainty evidence showing a medium beneficial effect of treatment on gambling symptom severity relative to placebo at post-treatment (SMD -0.59, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.08, n = 63). Comparative effectiveness: Two studies (n = 62) compared antidepressants with opioid antagonists, with very low certainty evidence indicating that antidepressants were no more effective than opioid antagonists on depressive symptoms (SMD 0.22, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.72, n = 62) or anxiety symptoms (SMD 0.21, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.72, n = 62) at post-treatment. Two studies (n = 58) compared antidepressants with mood stabilisers (including anticonvulsants), with very low certainty evidence indicating that antidepressants were no more effective than mood stabilisers on depressive symptoms (SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.56, n = 58) or anxiety symptoms (SMD 0.16, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.70, n = 58) at post-treatment. Tolerability and adverse events:\u00a0Several common adverse effects were reported by participants receiving antidepressants (e.g. headaches, nausea, diarrhoea/gastrointestinal issues) and opioid antagonists (e.g. nausea, dry mouth, constipation). There was little consistency in the types of adverse effects experienced by participants receiving mood stabilisers (e.g. tiredness, headaches, concentration difficulties) or atypical antipsychotics (e.g. pneumonia, sedation, increased hypomania). Discontinuation of treatment due to these adverse events was highest for opioid antagonists (10% to 32%), followed by antidepressants (4% to 31%), atypical antipsychotics (14%), and mood stabilisers (13%). This review provides preliminary support for the use of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine) to produce short-term improvements in gambling symptom severity, although a lack of available evidence precludes a conclusion regarding the degree to which these pharmacological agents can improve other gambling or psychological functioning indices. In contrast, the findings are inconclusive with regard to the effects of mood stabilisers (including anticonvulsants) in the treatment of disordered or problem gambling, and there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of antidepressants. However, these conclusions are based on very low to low certainty evidence characterised by a small number of included studies, high risk of bias, modest pooled sample sizes, imprecise estimates, moderate between-study heterogeneity, and exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidities. Moreover, there were insufficient studies to conduct meta-analyses on many outcome measures; to compare efficacy across and within major categories of interventions; to explore dosage effects; or to examine effects beyond post-treatment. These limitations suggest that, despite recommendations related to the administration of opioid antagonists in the treatment of disordered or problem gambling, pharmacological interventions should be administered with caution and with careful consideration of patient needs. A larger and more methodologically rigorous evidence base with longer-term evaluation periods is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness and durability of pharmacological treatments for disordered or problem gambling.",

    "title": "The risk relationships between alcohol consumption, alcohol use disorder and alcohol use disorder mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nIncreasing levels of alcohol use are associated with a risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD), which, in turn, is associated with considerable burden. Our aim was to estimate the risk relationships between alcohol consumption and AUD incidence and mortality.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA systematic literature search was conducted, using Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and Web of Science for case-control or cohort studies published between 1 January 2000 and 8 July 2022. These were required to report alcohol consumption, AUD incidence and/or AUD mortality (including 100% alcohol-attributable deaths). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022343201). Dose-response and random-effects meta-analyses were used to determine the risk relationships between alcohol consumption and AUD incidence and mortality and mortality rates in AUD patients, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 5904 reports identified, seven and three studies from high-income countries and Brazil met the inclusion criteria for quantitative and qualitative syntheses, respectively. In addition, two primary US data sources were analyzed. Higher levels of alcohol consumption increased the risk of developing or dying from an AUD exponentially. At an average consumption of four standard drinks (assuming 10\u00a0g of pure alcohol/standard drink) per day, the risk of developing an AUD was increased sevenfold [relative risk (RR)\u2009=\u20097.14, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20095.13-9.93] and the risk of dying fourfold (RR\u2009=\u20093.94, 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.53-4.40) compared with current non-drinkers. The mortality rate in AUD patients was 3.13 (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.07-9.13) per 1000 person-years.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are exponential positive risk relationships between alcohol use and both alcohol use disorder incidence and mortality. Even at an average consumption of 20\u2009g/day (about one large beer), the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) is nearly threefold that of current non-drinkers and the risk of dying from an AUD is approximately double that of current non-drinkers.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nSystematic reviews of the relationship between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality have reported different relative risk (RR) curves, possibly due to the choice of reference group. Results have varied from 'J-shaped' curves, where low-volume consumption is associated with reduced risk, to monotonically increased risk with increasing consumption. We summarised the evidence on alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality exclusively from systematic reviews using lifetime abstainers or low-volume/occasional drinkers as the reference group.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic umbrella review of systematic reviews of the relationship between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality in prospective cohort studies using a reference group of lifetime abstainers or low-volume/occasional drinkers. Several databases (PubMed/Medline/Embase/PsycINFO/Cochrane Library) were searched to March 2022. Reviews were assessed for risk of bias, and those with reference groups containing former drinkers were excluded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFrom 2149 articles retrieved, 25 systematic reviews were identified, and five did not include former drinkers in the reference group. Four of the five included reviews had high risk of bias. Three reviews reported a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality with significant decreased risk for low-volume drinking (RR range 0.84 to 0.95), while two reviews did not. The one review at low risk of bias reported monotonically increased risk with greater consumption (RRs = 1.02, 1.13, 1.33 and 1.52 for low-, medium-, high- and higher-volume drinking, respectively, compared with occasional drinking). All five reviews reported significantly increased risk with higher levels of alcohol consumption (RR range 1.28 to 3.70). Sub-group analyses were reported by sex and age; however, there were evidence gaps for many important factors. Conversely, 17 of 20 excluded systematic reviews reported decreased mortality risk for low-volume drinking.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOver 70% of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published to March 2022 of all-cause mortality risk associated with alcohol consumption did not exclude former drinkers from the reference group and may therefore be biased by the 'sick-quitter effect'.",

    "abstract": "The causal effects of alcohol-in-moderation on cardiometabolic health are continuously debated. Mendelian randomization (MR) is an established method to address causal questions in observational studies. We performed a systematic review of the current evidence from MR studies on the association between alcohol consumption and cardiometabolic diseases, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular risk factors. We performed a systematic search of the literature, including search terms on type of design and exposure. We assessed methodological quality based on key elements of the MR design: use of a full instrumental variable analysis and validation of the three key MR assumptions. We additionally looked at exploration of non-linearity. We reported the direction of the studied associations. Our search yielded 24 studies that were eligible for inclusion. A full instrumental variable analysis was performed in 17 studies (71%) and 13 out of 24 studies (54%) validated all three key assumptions. Five studies (21%) assessed potential non-linearity. In general, null associations were reported for genetically predicted alcohol consumption with the primary outcomes cardiovascular disease (67%) and diabetes (75%), while the only study on all-cause mortality reported a detrimental association. Considering the heterogeneity in methodological quality of the included MR studies, it is not yet possible to draw conclusions on the causal role of moderate alcohol consumption on cardiometabolic health. As MR is a rapidly evolving field, we expect that future MR studies, especially with recent developments regarding instrument selection and non-linearity methodology, will further substantiate this discussion.",

    "title": "The effect of tobacco tax increase on price-minimizing tobacco purchasing behaviours: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nTobacco product excise taxes are a cost-effective method for reducing tobacco consumption, but industry pricing and marketing strategies encourage consumers to engage in price-minimizing behaviours (PMBs). We investigated the relationship between tobacco tax increases and PMBs, measuring whether PMBs intensify following tax increases, whether low-income consumers with higher nicotine dependence are more likely to engage in PMBs and whether PMBs are negatively related to smoking cessation.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis was a systematic review with meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies from seven databases up to March 2023, using studies that reported any product- and purchasing-related smoking behaviours post-tobacco tax increase in a general representative population. Sixty-eight\u00a0studies were quality-assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. All studies were narratively synthesized, with five studies involving 13\u2009068-26\u2009575 participants providing data for pooled analyses on PMBs [purchasing lower-priced brands, roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco and cartons] pre- and post-tax increases using a random effects meta-analytical model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-seven studies reported on legal PMBs, and 17 studies reported illicit cigarette purchasing. Meta-analysis showed that consecutive tax increases were positively associated with purchasing RYO [odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20091.60, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.04-2.46], especially in higher tobacco taxing environments, with substantial heterogeneity (I2\u00a0=\u200996%). Lower income and higher nicotine dependence were associated with purchasing lower-priced brands and RYO, whereas higher income and nicotine dependence were associated with purchasing cartons, large-sized packs and cross-border sales. Less evidence associated illicit tobacco purchases with tax increases or PMBs with smoking cessation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTobacco purchasers' PMBs vary widely by state, country and time-period within countries.

    "title": "Alcohol consumption and breast cancer prognosis after breast cancer diagnosis: a systematic review and meta\u2011analysis of the Japanese Breast Cancer Society Clinical Practice Guideline, 2022 edition",
    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is internationally recognized as one of the compelling risk factors for breast cancer, but it does not necessarily correlate with the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Alcohol consumption in breast cancer patients was addressed in the 2022 Breast Cancer Clinical Practice Guidelines. A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies on alcohol consumption and breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer-related mortality, all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality in breast cancer patients was performed. The PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Ichushi-Web databases were searched for relevant publications reporting cohort or case\u2013control studies published until March 2021. A total of 33 studies (32 cohort studies and 1 case\u2013control study) met the eligibility criteria; 4638 cases of recurrence, 12,209 cases of breast cancer-specific mortality, and 21,945 cases of all-cause mortality were observed. With regard to breast cancer recurrence, 7 studies assessed pre-diagnosis alcohol consumption (relative risk (RR) 1.02, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.77\u20131.37, p\u2009=\u20090.88) and 3 studies assessed post-diagnosis alcohol consumption (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85\u20131.10, p\u2009=\u20090.57), and no significant increase or decrease in risk was observed. With regard to breast cancer-related mortality, 19 studies assessed pre-diagnosis alcohol consumption (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93\u20131.11, p\u2009=\u20090.69), 9 studies assessed post-diagnosis alcohol consumption (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77\u20131.19, p\u2009=\u20090.70), and no significant increase or decrease in risk was observed. With regard to all-cause mortality, 18 studies assessed pre-diagnosis alcohol consumption (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.99, p\u2009=\u20090.02), 8 studies assessed post-diagnosis alcohol consumption (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74\u20131.02, p\u2009=\u20090.08), and pre-diagnosis alcohol consumption was associated with a significantly decreased risk. With regard to cardiovascular disease mortality and alcohol consumption, 2 studies assessed it, and the RRwas 0.47 (95% CI 0.28\u20130.79, p\u2009=\u20090.005), showing that alcohol consumption was associated with a significantly decreased risk. The limitations of this study are that drinking status was mainly based on a questionnaire survey, which is somewhat inaccurate and has many confounding factors, and the cut-off value for the maximum alcohol intake in many studies was low, and it is possible that the actual intake was only an appropriate amount. In many countries, a standard drinking amount is set, and wise decisions are required.",

    "title": "The effect of alcohol consumption on human physiological and perceptual responses to heat stress: a systematic scoping review",
    "abstract": "Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) consumption is ostensibly known to increase the risk of morbidity and mortality during hot weather and heatwaves. However, how alcohol independently alters physiological, perceptual, and behavioral responses to heat stress remains poorly understood. Therefore, we conducted a systematic scoping review to understand how alcohol consumption affects thermoregulatory responses to the heat. We searched five databases employing the following eligibility criteria, studies must have: 1) involved the oral consumption of ethanol, 2) employed a randomized or crossover-control study design with a control trial consisting of a volume-matched, non-alcoholic beverage, 3) been conducted in healthy adult humans, 4) reported thermophysiological, perceptual, hydration status markers, and/or behavioral outcomes, 5) been published in English, 6) been conducted in air or water at temperatures of\u2009>\u200928\u00b0C, 7) involved passive rest or exercise, and 8) been published before October 4th, 2023. After removing duplicates, 7256 titles were screened, 29 papers were assessed for eligibility and 8 papers were included in the final review. Across the 8 studies, there were a total of 93 participants (93 male/0 female), the average time of heat exposure was 70 min and average alcohol dose was 0.68 g\u00b7kg1. There were 23 unique outcome variables analyzed from the studies. The physiological marker most influenced by alcohol was core temperature (lowered with alcohol consumption in 3/4 studies). Additionally, skin blood flow was increased with alcohol consumption in the one study that measured it. Typical markers of dehydration, such as increased urine volume (1/3 studies), mass loss (1/3 studies) and decreased plasma volume (0/2 studies) were not consistently observed in these studies, except for in the study with the highest alcohol dose. The effect of alcohol consumption on thermoregulatory responses is understudied, and is limited by moderate doses of alcohol consumption, short durations of heat exposure, and only conducted in young-healthy males. Contrary to current heat-health advice, the available literature suggests that alcohol consumption does not seem to impair physiological responses to heat in young healthy males.",

    "title": "Sex-specific association between alcohol consumption and liver cirrhosis: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Different studies have shown that females develop liver diseases at lower levels of alcohol consumption than males. Our aim was to quantify the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of liver cirrhosis by sex and identify the differences between females and males. A systematic review was conducted using PubMed/Medline and Embase to identify longitudinal and case-control studies that analyzed the relationship between the level of alcohol use and liver cirrhosis (LC) incidence, and mortality (ICD-8 and ICD-9 codes 571 and ICD-10 codes K70, K73, K74). Pooled relative risks (RR) were calculated by random effects models. Restricted cubic splines were used to model the dose-response relationship. A total of 24 studies were included in the analysis. There were collectively 2,112,476 females and 924,853 males, and a total of 4,301 and 4,231 cases of LC for females and males, respectively. We identified a non-linear dose-response relationship. Females showed a higher risk for LC compared to males with the same amount of alcohol consumed daily. For instance, drinking 40 g/day showed RRs of 9.35 (95% CI 7.64-11.45) in females and 2.82 (95% CI 2.53-3.14) in males, while drinking 80 g/day presented RRs of 23.32 (95% CI 18.24-29.82) in females and 7.93 (95% CI 7.12-8.83) in males. Additional analyses showed that a higher risk for females was found for morbidity and for mortality. Understanding the influence of sex on the association of alcohol consumption and the risk of LC is needed to develop recommendations and clinical guidelines for prevention and treatment.

    "title": "The Impact of Taste Preference-Related Gene Polymorphisms on Alcohol Consumption Behavior: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Unhealthy alcohol consumption is recognized as a leading contributory factor to mortality and disability. In addition to other factors, taste sensation also mediates alcohol intake. The orosensation provoked by alcoholic drinks may vary across individuals and may be responsible for differences in preference for alcoholic beverages. Thus, individual genetic variability of taste preference may have an impact on alcohol consumption practices. The present review aimed to explore the associations between different taste preference polymorphisms and alcohol consumption behavior. Based on the PRISMA statement, the three databases PubMed, Web of Science and ProQuest Central were searched to identify articles and the Q-Genie tool was used to assess the quality of the included studies. Among the 17 studies included in this review, 5 and 12 were of good and moderate quality, respectively. Most of the studies analyzed TAS2R38 (taste 2 receptor member 38) rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939 polymorphisms. Due to the inconclusive findings on these variants and the very limited number of studies on other polymorphisms, additional extensive research is recommended to replicate the existing findings, to generate new knowledge to enhance our understanding of the complexity of alcohol consumption behavior and to aid the development of personalized recommendations on unhealthy alcohol use.",

    "title": "The potential impact of policies and structural interventions in reducing cardiovascular disease and mortality: a systematic review of simulation-based studies.",
    "abstract": "Background\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the potential effect of different structural interventions for preventing cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nMethods\nMedline and EMBASE were searched for peer-reviewed simulation-based studies of structural interventions for prevention of cardiovascular disease. We performed a systematic narrative synthesis.\n\n\nResults\nA total of 54 studies met the inclusion criteria. Diet, nutrition, tobacco and alcohol control and other programmes are among the policy simulation models explored. Food tax and subsidies, healthy food and lifestyles policies, palm oil tax, processed meat tax, reduction in ultra-processed foods, supplementary nutrition assistance programmes, stricter food policy and subsidised community-supported agriculture were among the diet and nutrition initiatives. Initiatives to reduce tobacco and alcohol use included a smoking ban, a national tobacco control initiative and a tax on alcohol. Others included the NHS Health Check, WHO 25 \u00d7 25 and air quality management policy.\n\n\nFuture work and limitations\nThere is significant heterogeneity in simulation models, making comparisons of output data impossible. While policy interventions typically include a variety of strategies, none of the models considered possible interrelationships between multiple policies or potential interactions. Research that investigates dose-response interactions between numerous modifications as well as longer-term clinical outcomes can help us better understand the potential impact of policy-level interventions.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe reviewed studies underscore the potential of structural interventions in addressing cardiovascular diseases. Notably, interventions in areas such as diet, tobacco, and alcohol control demonstrate a prospective decrease in cardiovascular incidents. However, to realize the full potential of such interventions, there is a pressing need for models that consider the interplay and cumulative impacts of multiple policies. Rigorous research into holistic and interconnected interventions will pave the way for more effective policy strategies in the future.\n\n\nStudy registration\nThe study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42019154836.\n\n\nFunding\nThis article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme as award number 17/148/05.",

    "abstract": "Background: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was: (i) to examine the association between wine consumption and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and coronary heart disease (CHD) and (ii) to analyse whether this association could be influenced by personal and study factors, including the participants\u2019 mean age, the percentage of female subjects, follow-up time and percentage of current smokers. Methods: In order to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched several databases for longitudinal studies from their inception to March 2023. This study was previously registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021293568). Results: This systematic review included 25 studies, of which the meta-analysis included 22 studies. The pooled RR for the association of wine consumption and the risk of CHD using the DerSimonian and Laird approach was 0.76 (95% CIs: 0.69, 0.84), for the risk of CVD was 0.83 (95% CIs: 0.70, 0.98), and for the risk of cardiovascular mortality was 0.73 (95% CIs: 0.59, 0.90). Conclusions: This research revealed that wine consumption has an inverse relationship to cardiovascular mortality, CVD, and CHD. Age, the proportion of women in the samples, and follow-up time did not influence this association. Interpreting these findings with prudence was necessary because increasing wine intake might be harmful to individuals who are vulnerable to alcohol because of age, medication, or their pathologies.",

Design Databases MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, APA Psycinfo, CINAHL Plus and Cochrane Reviews were searched from 1 January 2011 to 11 November 2022. Inclusion criteria were studies evaluating the impact of minimum pricing policies, and we excluded non-minimum pricing policies or studies without alcohol-related hospital outcomes. The Effective Public Health Practice Project tool was used to assess risk of bias, and the Bradford Hill Criteria were used to infer causality for outcome measures. Setting MUP sets a legally required floor price per unit of alcohol and is estimated to reduce alcohol-attributable healthcare burden. Participant All studies meeting inclusion criteria from any country Intervention Minimum pricing policy of alcohol Primary and secondary outcome measures Results 22 studies met inclusion criteria; 6 natural experiments and 16 modelling studies. Countries included Australia, Canada, England, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and Wales. Modelling studies estimated that MUP could reduce alcohol-related admissions by 3%\u201310% annually and the majority of real-world studies demonstrated that acute alcohol-related admissions responded immediately and reduced by 2%\u20139%, and chronic alcohol-related admissions lagged by 2\u20133 years and reduced by 4%\u20139% annually. Minimum pricing could target the heaviest consumers from the most deprived groups who tend to be at greatest risk of alcohol harms, and in so doing has the potential to reduce health inequalities. Using the Bradford Hill Criteria, we inferred a \u2018moderate-to-strong\u2019 causal link that MUP could reduce alcohol-related hospitalisation.

    "abstract": "Suicide is a complex and multifactorial public health problem. Understanding and addressing the various factors associated with suicide is crucial for prevention and intervention efforts. Machine learning (ML) could enhance the prediction of suicide attempts. A systematic review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and SID databases. We aim to evaluate the performance of ML algorithms and summarize their effects, gather relevant and reliable information to synthesize existing evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and provide a comprehensive list of the suicide risk factors using mixed method approach. Forty-one studies published between 2011 and 2022, which matched inclusion criteria, were chosen as suitable. We included studies aimed at predicting the suicide risk by machine learning algorithms except natural language processing (NLP) and image processing. The neural network (NN) algorithm exhibited the lowest accuracy at 0.70, whereas the random forest demonstrated the highest accuracy, reaching 0.94. The study assessed the COX and random forest models and observed a minimum area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.54. In contrast, the XGBoost classifier yielded the highest AUC value, reaching 0.97. These specific AUC values emphasize the algorithm-specific performance in capturing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for suicide risk prediction. Furthermore, our investigation identified several common suicide risk factors, including age, gender, substance abuse, depression, anxiety, alcohol consumption, marital status, income, education, and occupation. This comprehensive analysis contributes valuable insights into the multifaceted nature of suicide risk, providing a foundation for targeted preventive strategies and intervention efforts. The effectiveness of ML algorithms and their application in predicting suicide risk has been controversial. There is a need for more studies on these algorithms in clinical settings, and the related ethical concerns require further clarification. \u2022 Understanding various factors associated with suicide is crucial for prevention and intervention efforts. \u2022 Machine learning (ML) could enhance the prediction of suicide attempts. \u2022 The neural network (NN) algorithm exhibited the lowest accuracy of 0.70. \u2022 The random forest demonstrated the highest accuracy for suicide prediction.",

    "abstract": "Background Although acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality, its direct causal link with death is unclear. Clarifying this link is important to justify costly research on prevention of ARDS. Objective To estimate the attributable mortality, if any, of ARDS. Design First, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies reporting mortality of critically ill patients with and without ARDS matched for underlying risk factor. Next, we conducted a survival analysis of prospectively collected patient-level data from subjects enrolled in three intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts to estimate the attributable mortality of critically ill septic patients with and without ARDS using a novel causal inference method. Results In the meta-analysis, 44 studies (47 cohorts) involving 56\u2009081 critically ill patients were included. Mortality was higher in patients with versus without ARDS (risk ratio 2.48, 95% CI 1.86 to 3.30; p<0.001) with a numerically stronger association between ARDS and mortality in trauma than sepsis. In the survival analysis of three ICU cohorts enrolling 1203 critically ill patients, 658 septic patients were included. After controlling for confounders, ARDS was found to increase the mortality rate by 15% (95% CI 3% to 26%; p=0.015). Significant increases in mortality were seen for severe (23%, 95% CI 3% to 44%; p=0.028) and moderate (16%, 95% CI 2% to 31%; p=0.031), but not for mild ARDS. Conclusions ARDS has a direct causal link with mortality. Our findings provide information about the extent to which continued funding of ARDS prevention trials has potential to impart survival benefit. PROSPERO Registration Number CRD42017078313",

Specific keywords and MeSH terms were \u201cdexmedetomidine,\u201d \u201cbenzodiazepine,\u201d and \u201calcohol withdrawal syndrome.\u201d The last search was on September 16, 2022. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized/cohort studies exploring the use of DEX in the management of AWS were included. A total of 12 studies were included in the systematic review and 7 in the meta-analysis. Data Synthesis: The intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) was found to have a mean difference (MD) of 48.06 [37.48, 58.64], P = <0.001 for the cohort subgroup, significantly favoring the DEX arm, but, in contrast, pooled RCT data showed a result of \u201320.07 [\u201336.86, \u20133.28], P = 0.02, a shorter ICU LOS for the DEX arm. Bradycardia and hypotension incidence significantly favored the BZD arm in both subgroups. This study compares the effectiveness of adjunctive DEX in clinical practice and aims to help providers in critical decision-making by compiling and analyzing the best current available evidence of its use in AWS. Conclusions: Based on low to very low level of evidence, adjunctive DEX showed no significant difference for ICU LOS when compared with BZD alone. Pooled randomized trials potentially show a benefit but are similarly limited by their low quality of evidence.",

    "title": "Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and the Risk of Head and Neck Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Case\u2013Control Studies",
    "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide, with rising incidence rates and significant mortality. While tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and viral infections are established risk factors, the role of dietary patterns, particularly adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), in HNC prevention has gained increasing attention. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the association between adherence to the MD and the risk of HNC. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines, to identify relevant studies published up to January 2024 that assessed the association between MD adherence and HNC risk in adults. Pooled odds ratios (OR) for a three-unit increase in MD adherence scores and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results: Eleven case\u2013control studies comprising 6106 HNC cases and 9166 controls met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. High adherence to the MD was significantly associated with a reduced risk of HNC (pooled OR = 0.561, 95% CI: 0.368\u20130.856, p = 0.007, I2 = 92%). Individual component analyses from three studies revealed that higher fruit and vegetable consumption significantly decreased HNC risk, whereas legumes, fish, and low meat intake showed no statistically significant associations. Conclusions: Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a significantly reduced risk of head and neck cancer. These findings support the role of the MD in cancer prevention and highlight the potential benefits of MD adherence in reducing HNC risk. Further prospective studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.",

    "title": "Physical activity during pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and dose\u2013response meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Previous research has indicated the inverse association between physical activity (PA) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, the dose\u2013response relationship currently remains undetermined. This study aims to explore the dose\u2013response relationship between PA during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and GDM risk. Studies on the relationship between PA during pregnancy and GDM risk published before April 25, 2023, were searched for in six databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all literature was screened for eligibility. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess risk of bias. Publication bias was examined using funnel plots, Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s tests, as well as trim-and-fill analysis. We harmonized exposure estimates of PA during pregnancy to the common unit of the metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week. Restricted cubic splines were used to model the dose\u2013response relationship. The criteria from the World Cancer Research Fund were used to assess the certainty of evidence across outcomes. All analyses were performed using Stata 15.1. The results indicated that in contrast with the lowest level of PA, promoting the highest PA level lowers the risk of GDM by 36% (RR\u2009=\u20090.64, 95%CI: 0.53\u2009~\u20090.78). We found a curvilinear dose\u2013response association between PA during the first trimester and incident GDM (Pnonlinearity\u2009=\u20090.012). Compared to inactive pregnant women, for those who achieved the guidelines-suggested minimum level (10 MET-h/week) of PA during the first trimester, the GDM risk was decreased by 13% (RR\u2009=\u20090.87, 95%CI: 0.79\u2009~\u20090.96). A linear relationship was found between PA during the second trimester and the GDM risk (Pnonlinearity\u2009=\u20090.276). The results with a restricted cubic spline model suggested that pregnant women who accumulate 10 MET-h/week have a 1% reduced risk of GDM compared to completely inactive individuals. Twice (20 MET-h/week) or a higher amount of PA (50 MET-h/week) contributed to further reductions in GDM risk. There is a dose\u2013response relationship between higher levels of PA in both the first and second trimesters and reduced risk of GDM; the relationship is stronger in the first trimester. Increasing PA during pregnancy can prevent the development of GDM. CRD42023420564.",

    "title": "Phenobarbital and Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a complication frequently encountered among patients who are chronic alcohol abusers. It is considered to have a significant impact on the United States healthcare system. It not only has a toll on the healthcare spending but also contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. Benzodiazepines are considered first line in the treatment of AWS. Since patients with alcohol use disorder have downregulated gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, this often leads to benzodiazepine resistance. Phenobarbital is also used in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Here we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of the drug. We conducted an electronic database search for relevant studies published between the inception of the project and November 20, 2022, in three databases, including Medline/PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Our study included all original studies with prime focus on the baseline characteristics of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for alcohol withdrawal syndrome and management/monitoring protocol implemented for its treatment. The primary outcomes that were the focus of our study consisted of changes in the length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and changes in scoring systems (for alcohol withdrawal assessment and monitoring) following the implementation of phenobarbital. The secondary outcomes included complications such as intubation and mortality. Based on our analysis, the mean difference in hospital stay was statistically significant at -2.6 (95% CI, -4.48, -0.72, P=0.007) for phenobarbital compared to the benzodiazepine group. We were unable to comment on the heterogeneity in our meta-analysis due to the standard deviation not being reported in one study. There was no statistically significant difference regarding the length of stay in the intensive care unit compared to the control/comparative arm, with a mean difference of -1.17 (95% CI, -1.17, 0.09, P=0.07), with considerable heterogeneity (I2=77%, P=0.002). Our meta-analysis also investigated the risk of intubation between the phenobarbital and the control/comparative group. There was statistically significant difference in the incidence of intubation, relative risk (RR) 0.52 (95% CI, 0.25, 1.08, P=0.08), with considerable heterogeneity (I2=80%, P=0.0001). Our study concludes that phenobarbital is an effective tool in the management of AWS in an ICU setting. However, various studies have reported contradictory results, and vital information appears to be lacking. Moreover, there is a lack of uniformity in terms of phenobarbital dosing. Drug administration should be adapted according to the severity of the symptoms. Further studies need to be conducted discussing the safety profile and adverse effects of the drug when it comes to the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To assess the evidence for price-based alcohol policy interventions to determine whether minimum unit pricing (MUP) is likely to be effective. Design Systematic review and assessment of studies according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, against the Bradford Hill criteria for causality. Three electronic databases were searched from inception to February 2017. Additional articles were found through hand searching and grey literature searches. Criteria for selecting studies We included any study design that reported on the effect of price-based interventions on alcohol consumption or alcohol-related morbidity, mortality and wider harms. Studies reporting on the effects of taxation or affordability and studies that only investigated price elasticity of demand were beyond the scope of this review. Studies with any conflict of interest were excluded. All studies were appraised for methodological quality. Results Of 517 studies assessed, 33 studies were included: 26 peer-reviewed research studies and seven from the grey literature. All nine of the Bradford Hill criteria were met, although different types of study satisfied different criteria. For example, modelling studies complied with the consistency and specificity criteria, time series analyses demonstrated the temporality and experiment criteria, and the analogy criterion was fulfilled by comparing the findings with the wider literature on taxation and affordability. Conclusions Overall, the Bradford Hill criteria for causality were satisfied. There was very little evidence that minimum alcohol prices are not associated with consumption or subsequent harms. However the overall quality of the evidence was variable, a large proportion of the evidence base has been produced by a small number of research teams, and the quantitative uncertainty in many estimates or forecasts is often poorly communicated outside the academic literature. Nonetheless, price-based alcohol policy interventions such as MUP are likely to reduce alcohol consumption, alcohol-related morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Background Nausea and vomiting is a common ED chief complaint. However, randomised trials comparing antiemetic agents to placebo have not demonstrated superiority. This systematic review investigates the efficacy of inhaled isopropyl alcohol (IPA) compared with usual care or placebo in adults presenting to the ED with nausea and vomiting. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, other relevant trial registries, journals, and conference proceedings up to September 2022. Randomised controlled trials using IPA to treat adult ED patients with nausea and vomiting were included. The primary outcome was change in severity of nausea, measured by a validated scale. A secondary outcome was vomiting during the ED stay. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and assessed certainty of evidence using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Results Two trials comparing inhaled IPA to saline placebo and including a total of 195 patients were pooled for meta-analysis of the primary outcome. A third study comparing a group receiving inhaled IPA and oral ondansetron to another group receiving inhaled saline placebo and oral ondansetron did not qualify for the original registered protocol, but was included in a secondary analysis. All studies were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias. The pooled mean difference for the primary analysis was a reduction in reported nausea of 2.18 on a 0\u201310 scale (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.76), favouring IPA over placebo, where the minimum clinically significant difference was defined as 1.5. The evidence level was graded as moderate, due to imprecision from low patient numbers. Only the study included in the secondary analysis assessed the secondary outcome of vomiting, and did not find a difference between intervention and control. Conclusion This review suggests that IPA likely has a modest effect in reducing nausea in adult ED patients, compared with placebo. Larger multicentre trials are needed, as the evidence is limited by few trials and patients. PROSPERO registration number CRD42022299815",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Combined low-risk lifestyle behaviors (LRLBs) have been associated with a reduction in type 2 diabetes risk. This relationship has not been systematically quantified. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association of combined LRLBs with type 2 diabetes. Databases were searched up to September 2022. Prospective cohort studies reporting the association between a minimum of three combined LRLBs (including healthy diet) with incident type 2 diabetes were included. Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality. Risk estimates of extreme comparisons were pooled using a random-effects model. Global dose-response meta-analysis (DRM) for maximum adherence was estimated using a one-stage linear mixed model. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations). RESULTS Thirty cohort comparisons (n = 1,693,753) involving 75,669 incident type 2 diabetes cases were included. LRLBs, with author-defined ranges, were healthy body weight, healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking abstinence or cessation, and light alcohol consumption. LRLBs were associated with 80% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (relative risk [RR] 0.20; 95% CI 0.17\u20130.23), comparing the highest with lowest adherence. Global DRM for maximum adherence to all five LRLBs reached 85% protection (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.12\u20130.18). The overall certainty of the evidence was graded as high. CONCLUSIONS There is a very good indication that a combination of LRLBs that includes maintaining a healthy bodyweight, healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking abstinence or cessation, and light alcohol consumption is associated with a lower risk of incident type 2 diabetes.",

We selected only randomised controlled trials with adult patients with tobacco or alcohol use disorders according to DSM-5 criteria. Interventions included any molecule having a direct pharmacological action on alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors (agonist or antagonist). Comparators were placebo or other validated pharmacotherapies. The duration of the intervention was a minimum of one month, with three months of follow-up.

    "title": "Pulmonary perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction and persistent symptoms after pulmonary embolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Extract Up to 50% of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) survivors have persistent symptoms or alterations of cardiocirculatory function, as well as a reduction in the quality of life (QoL) [1\u20134]. Patients who remain symptomatic despite receiving a minimum of 3\u2005months of adequate anticoagulant treatment, are considered to have the post-PE syndrome (PPES) [5]. PPES consists of various aetiologies explaining a lack of recovery from acute PE: chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (i.e. patients with 1) mismatched perfusion defects on ventilation/perfusion (V\u2032/Q\u2032) scan and specific diagnostic signs for CTEPH on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in combination with 2) mean pulmonary artery pressure at rest >20\u2005mmHg, pulmonary artery wedge pressure of \u226415\u2005mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance of >2\u2005Woods Units [6]); chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) without pulmonary hypertension (PH) (i.e. patients present mismatched perfusion defects on V\u2032/Q\u2032 scan and specific signs of organised fibrotic clots on CTPA, magnetic resonance imaging or conventional pulmonary cineangiography, without increased pulmonary artery pressure at rest [7, 8]); post-PE cardiac dysfunction (characterised by persistent right ventricle impairment after PE); post-PE functional impairment (possibly related to deconditioning); or other cardiopulmonary comorbidities [6, 8\u201310]. Graphical abstract PE: pulmonary embolism; V\u2032/Q\u2032: ventilation/perfusion; CTPA: computed tomography pulmonary angiography. #: no meta-analysis performed due to heterogeneity. Introduction: Up to 50% of pulmonary embolism (PE) patients have perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction during follow-up despite adequate anticoagulant treatment, and a similar percentage experience chronic functional limitations and/or dyspnoea post-PE. We aimed to evaluate the association between pulmonary perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction and functional recovery after PE. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including studies assessing both the presence of perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction and functional recovery (i.e. persistent symptoms, quality of life, exercise endurance). An odds ratio was pooled for perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction and persistent symptoms using a random-effect model. Results: 12 studies were included totalling 1888 PE patients; at a median of 6\u2005months after PE (range 2\u201372 months), 34% had perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction and 37% reported persistent symptoms. Among patients with perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction, 48% (95% CI 37\u201360%, I2=82%) remained symptomatic during follow-up, compared to 34% (95% CI 20\u201351%, I2=96%) of patients without such defects. Presence of perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction was associated with persistent symptoms (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.66\u20132.78; I2=0%, \u03c4=0). Notably, there was no association between these defects and quality of life or cardiopulmonary exercise test parameters. Conclusion: While the odds of having persistent symptoms was higher in patients with perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction after acute PE, a significant proportion of these patients reported no limitations. A possible causality between perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction and residual functional limitation therefore remains to be proven.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nProximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) is a complication of surgical management for adult spinal deformity (ASD) with a multifactorial etiology. Many risk factors are controversial, and their relative importance is not fully understood. The authors aimed to elucidate the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and PJK.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science keywords of \"Proximal Junctional Kyphosis [MeSH] OR Proximal Junctional Failure [MeSH]\" AND \"Bone Mineral Density [MeSH] OR Hounsfield Units [MeSH] OR DEXA [MeSH]\" set to the date range of January 2002 to July 2022. Studies required a minimum of 10 patients and 12 months of follow-up. Articles were included if they were in the English language and presented a primary retrospective cohort that included a comparison of patients with and without PJK, as well as a radiographic biomarker for BMD, such as Hounsfield units (HU) or T-score.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 18 unique studies with 2185 patients who underwent ASD surgery were identified. Of these, 537 patients (24.6%) developed PJK. Eight studies provided T-scores that were amenable to comparison, which found that patients who developed PJK were found to have lower BMD T-scores by a mean of -0.69 (95% CI -0.88 to -0.50; I2 = 63.9%, p < 0.001). The HU at the UIV among patients with the PJK group (n = 101) compared with the non-PJK group (n = 156) was found to be significantly lower (mean difference -32.35, 95% CI -46.05 to -18.65; I2 = 28.7%, p < 0.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis meta-analysis suggests that low preoperative BMD as measured by T-score and a diagnosis of osteoporosis were associated with higher postoperative PJK. Additionally, lower HU on CT at the UIV were found to be significant risk factors for postoperative PJK as well. These findings suggest that more attention to preoperative BMD is a risk factor for PJK among ASD patients is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is one of the leading causes of early death in the UK and worldwide. Public health guidance recommends the use of varenicline, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as smoking cessation aids in the UK. Additionally, the first electronic cigarette has been licensed for use as a smoking cessation medicine. However, there are ongoing concerns about the safety of these medicines. We present a protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to determine how these smoking cessation medicines compare to each other with respect to their neuropsychiatric safety in adult smokers. Secondary aims include updating the evidence regarding the effectiveness and cardiovascular safety of these medicines for use in a cost-effectiveness analysis. We will include randomised controlled trials and observational studies with control groups comparing monotherapy with varenicline, bupropion, NRT or electronic cigarette and combination therapies to each other, placebo or usual care. The primary composite safety outcome will be serious adverse events, defined as events that resulted in death, were life threatening, required hospitalisation or resulted in significant disability or congenital/birth defect. The preferred effectiveness outcome will be sustained smoking cessation defined as abstinence for a minimum of 6\u2009months as determined by biochemical validation. We will include trials identified by previous reviews and search relevant databases for newly published trials as well as contacting study authors to identify unpublished information. We will conduct fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analyses for each pairwise comparison of treatments and outcome; where these estimates differ, we will consider reasons for heterogeneity, quantified using the between-study variance (\u03c4 Ethics approval is not required for this evidence synthesis study as it involves analysis of secondary data from randomised controlled trials and observational studies.

    "title": "The effectiveness of refutation text in confronting scientific misconceptions: A meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Misinformation around scientific issues is rampant on social media platforms, raising concerns among educators and science communicators. A variety of approaches have been explored to confront this growing threat to science literacy. For example, refutations have been used both proactively as warning labels and in attempts to inoculate against misconceptions, and retroactively to debunk misconceptions and rebut science denialism. Refutations have been used by policy makers and scientists when communicating with the general public, yet little is known about their effectiveness or consequences. Given the interest in refutational approaches, we conducted a comprehensive, pre-registered meta-analysis comparing the effect of refutation texts to non-refutation texts on individuals\u2019 misconceptions about scientific information. We selected 71 articles (53 published and 18 unpublished) that described 76 studies, 111 samples, and 294 effect sizes. We also examined 26 moderators. Overall, our findings show a consistent and statistically significant advantage of refutation texts over non-refutation texts in controlled experiments confronting scientific misconceptions. We also found that moderators neither enhanced nor diminished the impact of the refutation texts. We discuss the implications of using refutations in formal and informal science learning contexts and in science communications from three theoretical perspectives.",

    "title": "PROTOCOL: The effectiveness of abstinence\u2010based and harm reduction\u2010based interventions in reducing problematic substance use in adults who are experiencing severe and multiple disadvantage homelessness: A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Homelessness is a major social and public health concern. It is a traumatic experience, and can have a devastating effect on those experiencing it. People who are homeless often face significant barriers when accessing public services, and those experiencing more visible and extreme forms of homelessness have often faced adverse childhood events, extreme social disadvantage, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, neglect, low self\u2010esteem, poor physical and mental health, and much lower life expectancy compared to the general population. Problematic substance use is disproportionately high amongst people experiencing homelessness, with many using drugs and alcohol to deal with the stress of living on the street, to keep warm, or to block out memories of previous abuse or trauma. Drug overdose is a major cause of death for people experiencing street homelessness. Substance dependency can also create barriers to successful transition to stable housing. There is ongoing policy interest in the effectiveness of different interventions that aim to stop, reduce or prevent problematic substance use, and there is specific interest in the relative effectiveness of interventions that adopt harm reduction or abstinence\u2010based approaches. Objectives The objective of this review is to understand the effectiveness of different substance use interventions. The review will consider the effectiveness of harm reduction\u2010based interventions, and abstinence\u2010based interventions, for adults experiencing homelessness. The focus of the review is on high\u2010income countries. Search Methods The primary source of studies for potential inclusion in this review is the Homelessness Effectiveness Studies Evidence and Gaps Maps (EGM). The first of these was published in 2018, with updates published in 2019 and 2020. A further update is due to be published in the summer of 2022. It is this update that provides the final list of studies from which this review will draw. The search for this update (EGM 4th edition) was completed in September 2021. Other potential studies will be identified through a call for grey evidence and hand\u2010searching key journals. Selection Criteria Eligible studies will be impact evaluations with designs at levels, 3, 4 and 5 of the Maryland Scientific Methods scale. This therefore includes all studies categorised as either \u2018Randomised Controlled Trials\u2019 or \u2018nonexperimental designs with a comparison group\u2019 from the studies which form the basis of the Homelessness Effectiveness Studies Evidence and Gap Maps (EGM) created by CHI and the Campbell Collaboration. We are interested in studies that examine the effect of interventions on substance use outcomes. Studies to be excluded are those with designs at levels 1 and 2 of the Maryland Scientific Methods scale, for example, studies without a control or comparison group, \u2018before vs. after\u2019 designs (without an untreated comparison group), and cross\u2010sectional regressions. Data Collection and Analysis Descriptive characteristics and statistical information in included studies will be coded and checked by at least two members of the review team. Studies selected for the review will be assessed for confidence in the findings using a critical appraisal tool for determining confidence in primary studies. Standardised effect sizes will be calculated and, if a study does not provide sufficient raw data for the calculation of an effect size, we will attempt to contact the author(s) to obtain this data. We will aim to use random\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis and robust\u2010variance estimation procedures to synthesise effect sizes. If a study includes multiple effects, we will carry out a critical assessment to determine (even if only theoretically) whether the effects are likely to be dependent. Where we suspect dependent effects, we will determine whether we can account for these by robust variance estimation. We will explore the moderating influence of participant and study characteristics, such as gender, race, substances targeted and length of follow\u2010up. Where effect sizes are converted from a binary to continuous measure (or vice versa), we will undertake a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of the inclusion of studies with a converted effect size in the meta\u2010analysis by running an additional analysis with these studies omitted. We will also assess the sensitivity of results to inclusion of non\u2010randomised studies and studies classified as low confidence in findings. All analyses will include an assessment of statistical heterogeneity. Finally, we will undertake analysis to assess whether publication bias is likely to be a factor in our findings.",

    "title": "Impact of health warning labels on selection and consumption of food and alcohol products: systematic review with meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Health warning labels (HWLs) could reduce harmful consumption of food (including non-alcoholic drinks) and alcoholic drinks. A systematic review with meta-analysis using Cochrane methods was conducted to assess the impact on selection (including hypothetical selection) or consumption of food or alcoholic drink products displaying image-and-text (sometimes termed \u2018pictorial\u2019) and text-only HWLs. Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included, three for alcohol, eleven for food. For the primary outcomes, eleven studies measured selection and one measured consumption (two measured only other secondary outcomes). Meta-analysis of twelve comparisons from nine studies (n=12,635) found HWLs reduced selection of the targeted product compared with no HWL (RR=0.74 (95%CI 0.68\u20130.80)), with participants 26% less likely to choose a product displaying a HWL. A planned subgroup analysis suggested a larger (although not statistically significant) effect on selection of image-and-text HWLs (RR=0.65 (95%CI 0.54\u20130.80)) than text-only HWLs (RR=0.79 (95%CI 0.74\u20130.85)). These findings suggest significant potential for HWLs to reduce selection of food and alcoholic drinks, but all experimental studies to date were conducted in laboratory or online settings with outcomes assessed immediately after a single exposure. Studies in field and naturalistic laboratory settings are needed to estimate the potential effects of food and alcohol HWLs.

    "title": "News Media and the Influence of the Alcohol Industry: An Analysis of Media Coverage of Alcohol Warning Labels With a Cancer Message in Canada and Ireland",
    "abstract": "Objective: Media coverage of alcohol-related policy measures can influence public debate and is often more aligned with interests of the alcohol industry than public health. The purpose of this study was to examine the framing of news coverage of alcohol warning label (AWL) initiatives that included a cancer message on alcohol containers in two different countries. Policy contexts and industry perspectives were also evaluated. Method: We identified and systematically reviewed news articles published between 2017\u20132019 covering an AWL academic study in Yukon, Canada, and labeling provisions in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in Ireland. Both included a cancer message. News stories were coded for media type and topic slant; inclusion of alcohol industry perspectives was examined using content analysis. Results: Overall, 68.4% of media articles covering the Yukon Study (n = 38) and 18.9% covering the Ireland Bill (n = 37) were supportive of AWLs with a cancer message. The majority of articles in both sites presented alcohol industry perspectives (Yukon, 65.8%; Ireland, 86.5%), and industry arguments opposing AWLs were similar across both contexts. In articles with statements from industry representatives, the label message was frequently disputed by distorting or denying the evidence that alcohol causes cancer (n = 33/43). Conclusions: News coverage of AWLs with a cancer message was more supportive in Canada than Ireland, where alcohol industry perspectives were consistently foregrounded. Industry arguments opposing the cancer label bore similarities across contexts, often distorting or denying the evidence. Increasing awareness of industry messaging strategies may generate more critical coverage of industry lobbying activities and increase public support for alcohol policies. (J. Stud.

    "abstract": "Front-of-pack (FoP) warning labels are a viable policy option with the potential to inform consumer choice and assist in reducing sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption as part of a multi-faceted approach. This study explored parents\u2019 perceptions and understanding of a range of SSB warning labels. Focus groups (n = 12) with 82 parents of school-aged children were conducted, stratified according to education level, sex and location. Health effects, exercise equivalents, sugar content (teaspoons in text and pictograms, \u201chigh in\u201d) and energy content labels were shown. Through thematic analysis we identified three themes. Theme 1 related to perceptions of effectiveness of labels, underpinned by four subthemes: perceptions of labels as credible, informative and useful, personally relevant and having the potential to change be haviour. Theme 2 related to participants finding opportunities for self-exemption (e.g., physically active) and message rejection (e.g., misinterpretation). Theme 3 encompassed the potential negative consequences of some labels (e.g., body image concerns). The text teaspoons label was perceived most favourably across all themes, with minimal negative issues raised. These results provide in-depth insight into potential responses to labelling as a policy intervention, providing important guidance for the development of labels to ensure optimal message content and framing for future testing and subsequent implementation.",

    "title": "Text Messaging Interventions for Reducing Alcohol Consumption Among Harmful and Hazardous Drinkers: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Mobile phone-based interventions have become popular for lifestyle behavior change, particularly the use of text messaging as it is a technology ubiquitous in mobile phones. Reviews and meta-analyses of digital interventions for reducing harmful and hazardous use of alcohol have mainly focused on Web-based interventions; thus, there is a need for a body of evidence to guide health practitioners, policy makers, and researchers with respect to the efficacy of available text messaging interventions. Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the effectiveness of text messaging interventions for reducing the amount of alcohol consumed among harmful and hazardous drinkers; this is compared to receiving no, minimal, or unrelated health information. Specifically, we ask the following questions: (1) Can interventions consisting of only text messages be effective in reducing alcohol consumption compared to no intervention or a minimal or unrelated intervention? (2) Can interventions consisting of only text messages be effective in reducing the prevalence of risky drinking compared to no intervention or a minimal or unrelated intervention? Methods Several databases will be searched, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index, ClinicalTrials.gov, OpenGrey, among others. Reports of studies that evaluate text messaging interventions for reducing the amount of alcohol consumed will be included. Primary outcomes of interest will be weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of heavy episodic drinking. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool will be used to assess bias in reports, and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to assess the quality of the body of evidence. A narrative review will be presented, and a meta-analysis will be conducted in case of homogeneity among included studies. Results The systematic review has not yet begun but is expected to start in May of 2019; publication of the final review and meta-analysis is expected at the end of 2019. Conclusions The technology for text messaging is ubiquitous in mobile phones; thus, the potential reach of interventions utilizing this technique is great. However, there are no meta-analyses to date that limit the scope to the use of text messaging interventions for alcohol consumption reduction. Therefore, the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis will help health practitioners, policy decision makers, researchers, and others to better understand the effects of these interventions.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nWhole-of-community interventions aim to reduce alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and harms by mobilizing community leaders, organizations and policy-makers to respond effectively to AOD use. The aim of this review is to estimate the effectiveness of whole-of-community interventions in reducing population-level harms arising from AOD use.\n\n\nDESIGN\nA systematic review of electronic databases CENTRAL, Embase, Medline, Medline in Process and PsycINFO was conducted from database inception to August 2017. Eligible trials had a parallel comparison group, implemented interventions in two or more community settings, and reported data on AOD use or harms.\n\n\nSETTING\nIntervention settings included schools, sporting clubs, police and law enforcement agencies, community centres, local media and retail premises.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nTwenty-four trials from 63 publications were included (n\u00a0=\u00a0249\u2009125 participants).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nOutcomes from AOD consumption (quantity and frequency), AOD-related crime and AOD-related accidents, injuries and hospital admissions. Data were pooled using random-effects inverse variance meta-analysis in Review Manager version 5.3.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nRisk of bias was mostly high, due to lack of random allocation, selective reporting and significant attrition. Meta-analyses indicated significant reductions in risky drinking [Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Scale (AUDIT) >\u00a08; three trials (7 data points), relative risk (RR)\u00a0=\u00a00.78, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.62-0.99)], but found no impact on past-month alcohol use (five trials, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.95, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89-1.02), binge drinking (five trials, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.97, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89-1.06) or 12-month marijuana use (two trials, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.98, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.86-1.11). Narrative synthesis indicated some reductions in AOD-related assault rates and arrests, but were equivocal for quantity of alcohol consumed, 12-month illicit drug use, assault or abuse, motor vehicle accidents and hospital admissions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInterventions to reduce alcohol and other drug use and harms applied to whole communities have resulted so far in small reductions in risky alcohol consumption, but have had little impact upon past month alcohol use, binge drinking or 12-month marijuana use and the studies have been subject to high risk of bias.",

    "abstract": "This preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD 42022311392) aimed to synthesize the effectiveness of all available population-level tobacco policies on smoking behaviour. Our search across 5 databases and leading organizational websites resulted in 9,925 records, with 476 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. In our narrative summary and both pairwise and network meta-analyses, we identified anti-smoking campaigns, health warnings and tax increases as the most effective tobacco policies for promoting smoking cessation. Flavour bans and free/discounted nicotine replacement therapy also showed statistically significant positive effects on quit rates. The network meta-analysis results further indicated that smoking bans, anti-tobacco campaigns and tax increases effectively reduced smoking prevalence. In addition, flavour bans significantly reduced e-cigarette consumption. Both the narrative summary and the meta-analyses revealed that smoking bans, tax increases and anti-tobacco campaigns were associated with reductions in tobacco consumption and sales. On the basis of the available evidence, anti-tobacco campaigns, smoking bans, health warnings and tax increases are probably the most effective policies for curbing smoking behaviour. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of population-level tobacco control policies, Akter et al. find that anti-tobacco campaigns, smoking bans, health warnings and tax increases are effective measures for curbing smoking behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Mandatory energy (calorie) labeling of alcoholic drinks is a public health measure that could be used to address both alcohol consumption and obesity. We systematically reviewed studies examining consumer knowledge of the energy content of alcoholic drinks, public support for energy labeling, and the effect of energy labeling of alcoholic drinks on consumption behavior. Eighteen studies were included. Among studies examining consumer knowledge of the energy content of alcoholic drinks (N = 8) and support for energy labeling (N = 9), there was moderate evidence that people are unaware of the energy content of alcoholic drinks (pooled estimate: 74% [95% CI: 64%\u201382%] of participants inaccurate) and support energy labeling (pooled estimate: 64% [95% CI: 53%\u201373%] of participants support policy). Six studies examined the effect of energy labeling on consumption behavior. In these studies, there was no evidence of a beneficial effect of labeling on alcohol drinking\u2010related outcome measures. However, the majority of studies were of low methodological quality and used proxy outcome measures, and none of the studies were conducted in real\u2010world settings, resulting in a very low level of evidence and high degree of uncertainty. Further research is required to determine whether energy labeling of alcoholic drinks is likely to be an effective public health policy.",

    "abstract": "Overconsumption of food and consumption of any amount of alcohol increases the risk of non-communicable diseases. Calorie (energy) labelling is advocated as a means to reduce energy intake from food and alcoholic drinks. However, there is continued uncertainty about these potential impacts, with a 2018 Cochrane review identifying only a small body of low-certainty evidence. This review updates and extends the 2018 Cochrane review to provide a timely reassessment of evidence for the effects of calorie labelling on people's selection and consumption of food or alcoholic drinks. - To estimate the effect of calorie labelling for food (including non-alcoholic drinks) and alcoholic drinks on selection (with or without purchasing) and consumption. - To assess possible modifiers - label type, setting, and socioeconomic status - of the effect of calorie labelling on selection (with or without purchasing) and consumption of food and alcohol. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, five other published or grey literature databases, trial registries, and key websites, followed by backwards and forwards citation searches. Using a semi-automated workflow, we searched for and selected records and corresponding reports of eligible studies, with these searches current to 2 August 2021. Updated searches were conducted in September 2023 but their results are not fully integrated into this version of the review. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs with between-subjects (parallel group) or within-subjects (cross-over) designs, interrupted time series studies, or controlled before-after studies comparing calorie labelling with no calorie labelling, applied to food (including non-alcoholic drinks) or alcoholic drinks. Eligible studies also needed to objectively measure participants' selection (with or without purchasing) or consumption, in real-world, naturalistic laboratory, or laboratory settings. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We applied the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias in included studies. Where possible, we used (random-effects) meta-analyses to estimate summary effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and subgroup analyses to investigate potential effect modifiers, including study, intervention, and participant characteristics. We synthesised data from other studies in a narrative summary. We rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We included 25 studies (23 food, 2 alcohol and food), comprising 18 RCTs, one quasi-RCT, two interrupted time series studies, and four controlled before-after studies. Most studies were conducted in real-world field settings (16/25, with 13 of these in restaurants or cafeterias and three in supermarkets); six studies were conducted in naturalistic laboratories that attempted to mimic a real-world setting; and three studies were conducted in laboratory settings. Most studies assessed the impact of calorie labelling on menus or menu boards (18/25); six studies assessed the impact of calorie labelling directly on, or placed adjacent to, products or their packaging; and one study assessed labels on both menus and on product packaging. The most frequently assessed labelling type was simple calorie labelling (20/25), with other studies assessing calorie labelling with information about at least one other nutrient, or calories with physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) labelling (or both). Twenty-four studies were conducted in high-income countries, with 15 in the USA, six in the UK, one in Ireland, one in France, and one in Canada. Most studies (18/25) were conducted in high socioeconomic status populations, while six studies included both low and high socioeconomic groups, and one study included only participants from low socioeconomic groups. Twenty-four studies included a measure of selection of food (with or without purchasing), most of which measured selection with purchasing (17/24), and eight studies included a measure of consumption of food. Calorie labelling of food led to a small reduction in energy selected (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.03; 16 randomised studies, 19 comparisons, 9850 participants; high-certainty evidence), with near-identical effects when including only studies at low risk of bias, and when including only studies of selection with purchasing. There may be a larger reduction in consumption (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.05; 8 randomised studies, 10 comparisons, 2134 participants; low-certainty evidence). These effect sizes suggest that, for an average meal of 600 kcal, adults exposed to calorie labelling would select 11 kcal less (equivalent to a 1.8% reduction), and consume 35 kcal less (equivalent to a 5.9% reduction). The direction of effect observed in the six non-randomised studies was broadly consistent with that observed in the 16 randomised studies. Only two studies focused on alcoholic drinks, and these studies also included a measure of selection of food (including non-alcoholic drinks). Their results were inconclusive, with inconsistent effects and wide 95% CIs encompassing both harm and benefit, and the evidence was of very low certainty. Current evidence suggests that calorie labelling of food (including non-alcoholic drinks) on menus, products, and packaging leads to small reductions in energy selected and purchased, with potentially meaningful impacts on population health when applied at scale. The evidence assessing the impact of calorie labelling of food on consumption suggests a similar effect to that observed for selection and purchasing, although there is less evidence and it is of lower certainty. There is insufficient evidence to estimate the effect of calorie labelling of alcoholic drinks, and more high-quality studies are needed. Further research is needed to assess potential moderators of the intervention effect observed for food, particularly socioeconomic status. Wider potential effects of implementation that are not assessed by this review also merit further examination, including systemic impacts of calorie labelling on industry actions, and potential individual harms and benefits. El consumo excesivo de alimentos, y el consumo de cualquier cantidad de alcohol aumenta el riesgo de enfermedades no transmisibles. El etiquetado cal\u00f3rico (energ\u00e9tico) est\u00e1 recomendado como un medio para reducir la ingesta energ\u00e9tica de alimentos y bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas. Sin embargo, sigue habiendo dudas acerca de estos posibles efectos, y una revisi\u00f3n Cochrane de 2018 identific\u00f3 solo un peque\u00f1o conjunto de evidencia de certeza baja. Esta revisi\u00f3n actualiza y ampl\u00eda la revisi\u00f3n Cochrane de 2018 para proporcionar una reevaluaci\u00f3n oportuna de la evidencia de los efectos del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico sobre la selecci\u00f3n y el consumo de alimentos o bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas por parte de las personas. \u2013 Estimar el efecto del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico de los alimentos (incluidas las bebidas no alcoh\u00f3licas) y las bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas sobre la selecci\u00f3n (con o sin compra) y el consumo. \u2013 Evaluar los posibles modificadores (tipo de etiqueta, contexto y nivel socioecon\u00f3mico) del efecto del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico sobre la selecci\u00f3n (con o sin compra) y el consumo de alimentos y alcohol. M\u00c9TODOS DE B\u00daSQUEDA: Se realizaron b\u00fasquedas en CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, otras cinco bases de datos de literatura publicada o gris, registros de ensayos y sitios web clave, seguidas de b\u00fasquedas de referencias citadas en los art\u00edculos y b\u00fasquedas prospectivas de referencias de los art\u00edculos identificados. Mediante un flujo de trabajo semiautom\u00e1tico, se buscaron y seleccionaron las entradas y los informes correspondientes de los estudios elegibles, y las b\u00fasquedas est\u00e1n actualizadas hasta el 2 de agosto de 2021. Las b\u00fasquedas actualizadas se realizaron en septiembre de 2023, pero sus resultados no est\u00e1n completamente integrados en esta versi\u00f3n de la revisi\u00f3n. CRITERIOS DE SELECCI\u00d3N: Los estudios elegibles fueron ensayos controlados aleatorizados (ECA) o cuasialeatorizados con dise\u00f1os intersujeto (grupos paralelos) o intrasujeto (crossover), estudios de series de tiempo interrumpido o estudios controlados tipo antes y despu\u00e9s que compararan el etiquetado cal\u00f3rico con ning\u00fan etiquetado cal\u00f3rico, aplicados a alimentos (incluidas las bebidas no alcoh\u00f3licas) o bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas. Los estudios elegibles tambi\u00e9n deb\u00edan medir objetivamente la selecci\u00f3n (con o sin compras) o el consumo de los participantes, en los contextos de vida real, laboratorio o laboratorio naturalista. OBTENCI\u00d3N Y AN\u00c1LISIS DE LOS DATOS: Dos autores de la revisi\u00f3n, de forma independiente, seleccionaron los estudios para la inclusi\u00f3n y extrajeron los datos de los estudios. Se aplic\u00f3 la herramienta de Cochrane RoB 2 y ROBINS\u2010I para evaluar el riesgo de sesgo de los estudios incluidos. Cuando fue posible, se utilizaron metan\u00e1lisis (de efectos aleatorios) para calcular las magnitudes globales del efecto como diferencias de medias estandarizadas (DME) con intervalos de confianza (IC) del 95%, y an\u00e1lisis de subgrupos para investigar los posibles modificadores del efecto, incluidos el estudio, la intervenci\u00f3n y las caracter\u00edsticas de los participantes. Se resumieron los datos de otros estudios en un resumen narrativo. La certeza de la evidencia se calific\u00f3 mediante el m\u00e9todo GRADE. Se incluyeron 25 estudios (23 de alimentos, 2 de alcohol y alimentos), que incluyeron 18 ECA, 1 ensayo controlado cuasialeatorizados, 2 series temporales interrumpidas y 4 estudios controlados de tipo antes y despu\u00e9s. La mayor\u00eda de los estudios se realizaron en contextos de condiciones real (16/25; 13 de ellos en restaurantes o cafeter\u00edas y tres en supermercados); seis estudios se realizaron en laboratorios naturalistas que trataron de imitar condiciones de la vida real; y tres estudios se realizaron en contextos de laboratorio. La mayor\u00eda de los estudios evaluaron la repercusi\u00f3n del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico en cartas o pizarras de men\u00fas (18/25); seis estudios evaluaron la repercusi\u00f3n del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico directamente en los productos o sus envases, o colocados junto a ellos; y un estudio evalu\u00f3 las etiquetas tanto en men\u00fas como en los envases de los productos. El tipo de etiquetado evaluado con mayor frecuencia fue el etiquetado cal\u00f3rico simple (20/25), y otros estudios evaluaron el etiquetado cal\u00f3rico con informaci\u00f3n sobre al menos otro nutriente, o el etiquetado cal\u00f3rico con equivalente cal\u00f3rico de actividad f\u00edsica (ECAF) (o ambos). Veinticuatro estudios se realizaron en pa\u00edses de ingresos altos, 15 en Estados Unidos, seis en el Reino Unido, uno en Irlanda, uno en Francia y uno en Canad\u00e1. La mayor\u00eda de los estudios (18/25) se llevaron a cabo en poblaciones de nivel socioecon\u00f3mico alto, seis estudios incluyeron grupos socioecon\u00f3micos bajos y altos, y un estudio incluy\u00f3 solo participantes de grupos socioecon\u00f3micos bajos. Veinticuatro estudios incluyeron una medida de selecci\u00f3n de alimentos (con o sin compra), la mayor\u00eda de los cuales midi\u00f3 la selecci\u00f3n con compra (17/24), y ocho estudios incluyeron una medida del consumo de alimentos. El etiquetado cal\u00f3rico de los alimentos dio lugar a una peque\u00f1a reducci\u00f3n de la energ\u00eda seleccionada (DME \u22120,06; IC del 95%: \u22120,08 a \u22120,03; 16 estudios aleatorizados, 19 comparaciones, 9850 participantes; evidencia de certeza alta), con efectos casi id\u00e9nticos cuando se incluyeron solo estudios con bajo riesgo de sesgo y cuando se incluyeron solo estudios de selecci\u00f3n con compra. Podr\u00eda haber una mayor reducci\u00f3n del consumo (DME \u22120,19; IC del 95%: \u22120,33 a \u22120,05; ocho estudios aleatorizados, 10 comparaciones, 2134 participantes; evidencia de certeza baja). Estas magnitudes del efecto indican que, para una comida media de 600 kcal, los adultos expuestos al etiquetado cal\u00f3rico seleccionar\u00edan 11 kcal menos (equivalente a una reducci\u00f3n del 1,8%) y consumir\u00edan 35 kcal menos (equivalente a una reducci\u00f3n del 5,9%). La direcci\u00f3n del efecto observada en los seis estudios no aleatorizados fue ampliamente consistente con la observada en los 16 estudios aleatorizados. Solo dos estudios se centraron en las bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas, y estos tambi\u00e9n incluyeron una medida de selecci\u00f3n de alimentos (incluidas las bebidas no alcoh\u00f3licas). Sus resultados no fueron concluyentes, con efectos inconsistentes e IC del 95% amplios que abarcaron tanto efectos perjudiciales como beneficiosos, y la evidencia fue de certeza muy baja. La evidencia actual apunta que el etiquetado cal\u00f3rico de los alimentos (incluidas las bebidas no alcoh\u00f3licas) en los men\u00fas, los productos y los envases da lugar a peque\u00f1as reducciones de la energ\u00eda seleccionada y adquirida, con efectos potencialmente significativos sobre la salud de la poblaci\u00f3n cuando se aplica a escala. La evidencia que eval\u00faa la repercusi\u00f3n del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico de los alimentos sobre el consumo indica un efecto similar al observado para la selecci\u00f3n y la compra, aunque hay menos evidencia y es de menor certeza. No hay evidencia suficiente para calcular el efecto del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico de las bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas, y se necesitan m\u00e1s estudios de alta calidad. Se necesitan m\u00e1s estudios de investigaci\u00f3n para evaluar los posibles moderadores del efecto observado de la intervenci\u00f3n en los alimentos, en particular el nivel socioecon\u00f3mico. Los posibles efectos m\u00e1s amplios de la implementaci\u00f3n que no se eval\u00faan en esta revisi\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n merecen ser m\u00e1s estudiados, incluidos la repercusi\u00f3n sist\u00e9mica del etiquetado cal\u00f3rico sobre las acciones de la industria y los posibles efectos perjudiciales y beneficiosos individuales.",

    "title": "[Evidence Map of Interventions to Reduce Alcohol ConsumptionMapa de la evidencia sobre intervenciones para reducir el consumo de alcohol].",
    "abstract": "Systematize evidence on the effect of global interventions to reduce the consumption and/or sale of alcoholic beverages. Evidence map based on searches in nine bibliographic databases, including 182 studies of systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, reviews of interventions, and reviews of reviews. The studies evaluated the effect of interventions grouped into comprehensive sets of actions: communication for behavior change; health-promoting environments; and systemic changes. Two outcomes of interest were considered: reduction in alcohol consumption and reduction in its purchase/sale. A total of 207 associations between different interventions and outcomes were recorded, with emphasis on communication for behavior change (81.64%) and reduction of consumption (98.55%). Most of the associations showed a positive (40.58%), inconclusive (28.99%), or potentially positive (26.57%) effect. The main interventions with positive or potentially positive results were: a government monopoly on the sale of alcoholic beverages, control of the density of points of sale, charging a minimum price per unit, health warnings on alcoholic beverage labels, and multiple integrated interventions. It is hoped that this map will help public policy makers and healthcare professionals adapt experiences to their own contexts, stimulating intersectoral actions to reduce alcohol consumption. Sistematizar evid\u00eancias sobre o efeito de interven\u00e7\u00f5es mundiais para a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do consumo e/ou venda de bebidas alco\u00f3licas. Mapa de evid\u00eancias que, a partir de buscas em nove bases bibliogr\u00e1ficas, incluiu 182 estudos de revis\u00f5es sistem\u00e1ticas com ou sem metan\u00e1lises, revis\u00f5es de interven\u00e7\u00f5es e revis\u00f5es de revis\u00f5es. Os estudos avaliaram o efeito de interven\u00e7\u00f5es - agrupadas em conjuntos abrangentes de a\u00e7\u00f5es: comunica\u00e7\u00e3o para mudan\u00e7a de comportamento; ambientes promotores da sa\u00fade e mudan\u00e7as dos sistemas - sobre dois desfechos de interesse: redu\u00e7\u00e3o de consumo e redu\u00e7\u00e3o da compra e/ou venda de \u00e1lcool. Foram registradas 207 associa\u00e7\u00f5es entre diferentes interven\u00e7\u00f5es e desfechos, com destaque para interven\u00e7\u00f5es de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o para mudan\u00e7a de comportamento (81,64%) e para o desfecho de redu\u00e7\u00e3o de consumo (98,55%). A maioria das associa\u00e7\u00f5es apresentou efeito positivo (40,58%), inconclusivo (28,99%) ou potencialmente positivo (26,57%). Das interven\u00e7\u00f5es com resultado positivo ou potencialmente positivo, destacam-se o monop\u00f3lio de vendas de bebidas alco\u00f3licas pelo governo, controle de densidade de pontos de venda, cobran\u00e7a de pre\u00e7o m\u00ednimo por unidade, advert\u00eancias sanit\u00e1rias em r\u00f3tulo de bebidas alco\u00f3licas e m\u00faltiplas interven\u00e7\u00f5es integradas.

Sistematizar la evidencia sobre el efecto de las intervenciones mundiales para reducir el consumo o la venta de bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas. A partir de b\u00fasquedas en nueve bases de datos bibliogr\u00e1ficas, se elabor\u00f3 un mapa de la evidencia que incluy\u00f3 182 estudios de revisi\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica sola o con metaan\u00e1lisis, revisi\u00f3n de intervenciones o revisi\u00f3n de revisiones. En estos estudios se evalu\u00f3 el efecto de las intervenciones, agrupadas en conjuntos completos de acciones (es decir, comunicaci\u00f3n para el cambio de comportamiento, entornos promotores de la salud y cambios en los sistemas) sobre dos desenlaces de inter\u00e9s: la reducci\u00f3n del consumo y la reducci\u00f3n de la compra o la venta de alcohol. Se registraron 207 asociaciones entre diferentes intervenciones y desenlaces. Entre las intervenciones destacan las de comunicaci\u00f3n para el cambio de comportamiento (81,64%) y entre los desenlaces el de reducci\u00f3n del consumo (98,55%). En su mayor\u00eda, las asociaciones mostraron un efecto favorable (40,58%), no concluyente (28,99%) o posiblemente favorable (26,57%). Entre las intervenciones con resultados favorables o posiblemente favorables destacan las siguientes: el establecimiento de un monopolio gubernamental de la venta de bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas, el control de la densidad de puntos de venta, el cobro de un precio m\u00ednimo por unidad, las advertencias de salud en las etiquetas de las bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas y varias intervenciones integradas.

    "title": "The effects of alcohol container labels on consumption behaviour, knowledge, and support for labelling: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol container labels might reduce population-level alcohol-related harms, but investigations of their effectiveness have varied in approach and quality. A systematic synthesis is needed to adjust for these differences and to yield evidence to inform policy. Our objectives were to establish the effects of alcohol container labels bearing one or more health warnings, standard drink information, or low-risk drinking guidance on alcohol consumption behaviour, knowledge of label message, and support for labels. We completed a systematic review according to Cochrane and synthesis without meta-analysis standards. We included all peer-reviewed studies and grey literature published from Jan 1, 1989, to March 6, 2024, in English, French, German, or Spanish that investigated the effects of alcohol container labels compared with no-label or existing label control groups in any population on alcohol consumption behaviour, knowledge of label message, or support for labels. Data were synthesised narratively as impact statements and assessed for risk of bias and certainty in the evidence. A protocol was preregistered (PROSPERO CRD42020168240). We identified 40 publications that studied 31 labels and generated 17 impact statements. 24 (60%) of 40 publications focused on consumption behaviour and we had low or very low certainty in 13 (59%) of 22 outcomes. Alcohol container labels bearing health warnings might slow the rate of alcohol consumption (low certainty), reduce alcoholic beverage selection (moderate certainty), reduce consumption during pregnancy (low certainty), and reduce consumption before driving (moderate certainty). Interventions with multiple types of rotating alcohol container labels likely substantially decrease alcohol use (moderate certainty) and reduce alcohol sales (high certainty). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on multiple types of alcohol container labels assessing their effects for certainty in the evidence. Limitations included heterogeneity in label designs and outcome measurements. Alcohol container labels probably influence some alcohol consumption behaviour, with multiple rotating messages being particularly effective, although effects might vary depending on individual health literacy or drinking behaviour. Alcohol container labels might therefore be effective components of policies designed to address population-level alcohol-related harms.",

    "title": "Restricting alcohol marketing to reduce alcohol consumption: A systematic review of the empirical evidence for one of the 'best buys'.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nEven though a ban of alcohol marketing has been declared a 'best buy' of alcohol control policy, comprehensive systematic reviews on its effectiveness to reduce consumption are lacking. The aim of this paper was to systematically review the evidence for effects of total and partial bans of alcohol marketing on alcohol consumption.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis descriptive systematic review sought to include all empirical studies that explored how changes in the regulation of alcohol marketing impact on alcohol consumption. The search was conducted between October and December 2022 considering various scientific databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase) as well as Google and Google Scholar. The titles and abstracts of a total of 2572 records were screened. Of the 26 studies included in the full text screening, 11 studies were finally included in this review. Changes in consumption in relation to marketing bans were determined based on significance testing in primary studies. Four risk of bias domains (confounding, selection bias, information bias and reporting bias) were assessed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSeven studies examined changes in marketing restrictions in one location (New Zealand, Thailand, Canadian provinces, Spain, Norway). In the remaining studies, between 17 and 45 locations were studied (mostly high-income countries from Europe and North America). Of the 11 studies identified, six studies reported null findings. Studies reporting lower alcohol consumption following marketing restrictions were of moderate, serious and critical risk of bias. Two studies with low and moderate risk of bias found increasing alcohol consumption post marketing bans. Overall, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that alcohol marketing bans reduce alcohol consumption.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe available empirical evidence does not support the claim of alcohol marketing bans constituting a best buy for reducing alcohol consumption.",

    "title": "Systematic review of guidance for the collection and use of patient-reported outcomes in real-world evidence generation to support regulation, reimbursement and health policy",
    "abstract": "Background Real-world evidence (RWE) plays an increasingly important role within global regulatory and reimbursement processes. RWE generation can be enhanced by the collection and use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which can provide valuable information on the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of health interventions from the patient perspective. This systematic review aims to examine and summarise the available PRO-specific recommendations and guidance for RWE generation. Methods and findings Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica Database, and websites of selected organisations were systematically searched to identify relevant publications. 1,249 articles were screened of which 7 papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. The included publications provided PRO-specific recommendations to facilitate the use of PROs for RWE generation and these were extracted and grouped into eight major categories. These included: (1) instrument selection, (2) participation and engagement, (3) burden to health care professionals and patients, (4) stakeholder collaboration, (5) education and training, (6) PRO implementation process, (7) data collection and management, and (8) data analysis and presentation of results. The main limitation of the study was the potential exclusion of relevant publications, due to poor indexing of the databases and websites searched. Conclusions PROs may provide valuable and crucial patient input in RWE generation. Whilst valuable insights can be gained from guidance for use of PROs in clinical care, there is a lack of international guidance specific to RWE generation in the context of use for regulatory decision-making, reimbursement, and health policy. Clear and appropriate evidence-based guidance is required to maximise the potential benefits of implementing PROs for RWE generation. Unique aspects between PRO guidance for clinical care and other purposes should be differentiated. The needs of various stakeholder groups (including patients, health care professionals, regulators, payers, and industry) should be considered when developing future guidelines.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Regulatory Policies on Online/Digital/Internet-Mediated Alcohol Marketing: a Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "The rapid growth of social networking sites and video sharing platforms has created an opportunity for the alcohol industry to employ advanced advertising and marketing approaches to target their audiences, increasingly blurring the lines between commercial marketing and user-generated content, which poses a challenge for effective regulation. We conducted a systematic search through three peer-reviewed journal databases (WoS, PubMed, Scopus). Studies were included if published in English, after 2004, and assessed statutory regulation or voluntary industry codes, enacted by an EU or nation\u2019s governmental agency or private entity, and with the intent to restrict digital alcohol advertising. In addition, we conducted a manual search of gray literature. A total of 4690 records were identified. After duplicate removal and full-text assessment, 14 articles were examined. Our findings indicate that children and adolescents may often be exposed to alcohol advertisements on social media and websites due to industry\u2019s self-regulatory age-affirmation systems being largely ineffective at preventing under-aged access. Cases of self-regulatory violations by the alcohol industry, and increasingly innovative \u2018gray-area\u2019 advertising approaches have also been noted. Additionally, research illustrates a lack of developed statutory restrictions of digital alcohol advertising and instead continued reliance on voluntary industry self-regulation. There is a substantial need for further research to examine the effectiveness of digital alcohol advertising restrictions in social media, websites and image/video sharing platforms. Moreover, there is a necessity for countries to develop comprehensive statutory frameworks, which would effectively restrict and monitor rapidly advancing digital alcohol advertising practices on new digital media.",

    "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThis study aims to identify the origins, mechanisms and outcomes of applying behavioral insight in public policy research.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe authors conducted a systematic literature review to answer three research questions. The authors identified 387 primary studies, dated from January 2000 to April 2021 and coded them through a thematic analysis. Related studies were obtained through searching in Emerald, ScienceDirect, Sage, Springer, Wiley and Routledge.\n\n\nFindings\nThe results identified eight themes for origins, 16 themes for mechanisms/techniques and 13 outcome-related themes. Through the thematic analysis, the major mechanisms of behavioral approach were found to be social marketing, information provision, social norms, incentives, affect, regulation design, framing, salience, defaults, simplification, networking, environment design, scheduled announcements, commitments, attitude-preference-behavior manifestation and combining behavioral and nonbehavioral mechanisms.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe findings of this review help policymakers to design or redesign policy elements.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis review provides the first systematic exploration of the existing literature on behavioral public policy.\n",

    "title": "Impact of food, beverage, and alcohol brand marketing on consumptive behaviors and health in children and adults: A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis",
    "abstract": "Exposure to unhealthy food, beverage, and alcohol marketing can contribute to inadequate diet and excess alcohol consumption, both risk factors for diet\u2010related non\u2010communicable diseases including obesity and cancer. By not featuring specific products, brand\u2010only marketing strategies circumvent restrictions that assess healthiness at the product level and restrict accordingly. Currently, there is no global or national government policy that explicitly addresses brand marketing for unhealthy products linked to diet\u2010related non\u2010communicable diseases. This systematic review and meta\u2010analysis synthesizes contemporary evidence on the effects of food, beverage, and alcohol brand\u2010marketing on diet\u2010related cognitive outcomes (preference, choice), diet\u2010related behavioral outcomes (purchase requests, purchase, consumption), and health\u2010related outcomes (body weight, body mass index, obesity) in children and adults. Included studies manipulated acute marketing exposure, with at least one brand\u2010only marketing condition. Fourteen databases were searched (including MEDLINE and PubMed) for articles published from January 2004 to February 2024. Nineteen eligible studies were identified and assessed for bias; five were included in the meta\u2010analysis assessing effects on consumption. Findings from the review suggest brand marketing for food, beverages, and alcohol can influence preference, choice, and purchase intent. The meta\u2010analysis found no evidence of a significant effect of brand\u2010only marketing on consumption. Overall, evidence was limited and of mixed quality so further robust research is needed to inform regulatory action. Government policies for reducing brand\u2010only marketing are needed to protect vulnerable populations from brand marketing promoting unhealthy consumption behaviors that increase the risk of non\u2010communicable disease.",

    "abstract": "ISSUES\nAdvertising and marketing affect alcohol use; however, no single systematic review has covered all aspects of how they affect alcohol use, and how the alcohol industry views alcohol marketing restrictions.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nTwo systematic reviews of reviews were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items on 2 February 2023. Results were analysed using a narrative synthesis approach.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nTwenty-three reviews were included in the systematic reviews. The first systematic review examined youth and adolescents (11 reviews), digital or internet marketing (3 reviews), alcohol marketing's impact on cognition (3 reviews), and alcohol marketing and policy options (2 reviews). The second systematic review focused on alcohol industry (i.e., importers, producers, distributors, retailers and advertising firms) response to advertising restrictions (four reviews). The reviews indicated that there is evidence that alcohol marketing (including digital marketing) is associated with increased intentions to drink, levels of consumption and harmful drinking among youth and young adults. Studies on cognition indicate that advertisements focusing on appealing contexts and outcomes may be more readily accepted by adolescents, and may be less easily extinguished in this population. The review of the alcohol industry found a strong desire to self-regulate alcohol advertising.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nWe found alcohol advertising and marketing is associated with increased drinking intentions, consumption and harmful drinking. Thus, policies which restrict advertising may be an effective way to reduce alcohol use.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMore research is needed to assess all aspects of the observed associations, especially as to how marketing policies impact women and people with alcohol dependence.",

    "title": "The effect of preoperative behaviour change interventions on pre- and post-surgery health behaviours, health outcomes, and health inequalities in adults: A systematic review and meta-analyses",
    "abstract": "Background Prehabilitation interventions are being delivered across surgical specialities to improve health risk behaviours leading to better surgical outcomes and potentially reduce length of hospital stay. Most previous research has focused on specific surgery specialities and has not considered the impact of interventions on health inequalities, nor whether prehabilitation improves health behaviour risk profiles beyond surgery. The aim of this review was to examine behavioural Prehabilitation interventions across surgeries to inform policy makers and commissioners of the best available evidence. Methods and findings A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to determine the effect of behavioural prehabilitation interventions targeting at least one of: smoking behaviour, alcohol use, physical activity, dietary intake (including weight loss interventions) on pre- and post-surgery health behaviours, health outcomes, and health inequalities. The comparator was usual care or no treatment. MEDLINE, PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Clinical trials and Embase databases were searched from inception to May 2021, and the MEDLINE search was updated twice, most recently in March 2023. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Outcomes were length of stay, six-minute walk test, behaviours (smoking, diet, physical activity, weight change, and alcohol), and quality of life. Sixty-seven trials were included; 49 interventions targeted a single behaviour and 18 targeted multiple behaviours. No trials examined effects by equality measures. Length of stay in the intervention group was 1.5 days shorter than the comparator (n = 9 trials, 95% CI -2.6 to -0.4, p = 0.01, I2 83%), although in sensitivity analysis prehabilitation had the most impact in lung cancer patients (-3.5 days). Pre-surgery, there was a mean difference of 31.8 m in the six-minute walk test favouring the prehabilitation group (n = 19 trials, 95% CI 21.2 to 42.4m, I2 55%, P <0.001) and this was sustained to 4-weeks post-surgery (n = 9 trials, mean difference = 34.4m (95%CI 12.8 to 56.0, I2 72%, P = 0.002)). Smoking cessation was greater in the prehabilitation group before surgery (RR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.8, I2 84%), and this was sustained at 12 months post-surgery (RR 1.74 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.55, I2 43%, Tau2 0.09, p = 0.004)There was no difference in pre-surgery quality of life (n = 12 trials) or BMI (n = 4 trials). Conclusions Behavioural prehabilitation interventions reduced length of stay by 1.5 days, although in sensitivity analysis the difference was only found for Prehabilitation interventions for lung cancer. Prehabilitation can improve functional capacity and smoking outcomes just before surgery. That improvements in smoking outcomes were sustained at 12-months post-surgery suggests that the surgical encounter holds promise as a teachable moment for longer-term behavioural change. Given the paucity of data on the effects on other behavioural risk factors, more research grounded in behavioural science and with longer-term follow-up is needed to further investigate this potential.",

    "title": "Alcohol Marketing and Adolescent and Young Adult Alcohol Use Behaviors: A Systematic Review of Cross-Sectional Studies",
    "abstract": "Objective: This article provides a systematic review of cross-sectional research examining associations between exposure to alcohol marketing and alcohol use behaviors among adolescents and young adults. Method: Literature searches of eight electronic databases were carried out in February 2017. Searches were not limited by date, language, country, or peer-review status. After abstract and full-text screening for eligibility and study quality, 38 studies that examined the relationship between alcohol marketing and alcohol use behaviors were selected for inclusion. Results: Across alcohol use outcomes, various types of marketing exposure, and different media sources, our findings suggest that cross-sectional evidence indicating a positive relationship between alcohol marketing exposure and alcohol use behaviors among adolescents and young adults was greater than negative or null evidence. In other words, cross-sectional evidence supported that alcohol marketing exposure was associated with young peoples\u2019 alcohol use behaviors. In general, relationships for alcohol promotion (e.g., alcohol-sponsored events) and owning alcohol-related merchandise exposures were more consistently positive than for other advertising exposures. These positive associations were observed across the past four decades, in countries across continents, and with small and large samples. Conclusions: Despite issues of measurement and construct clarity within this body of literature, this review suggests that exposure to alcohol industry marketing may be important for understanding and reducing young peoples\u2019 alcohol use behavior. Future policies aimed at regulating alcohol marketing to a greater extent may have important short- and long-term public health implications for reducing underage or problematic alcohol use among youth.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Prenatal exposure to alcohol (PAE) represents a significant public health concern. Previous research linking PAE to neurodevelopmental outcomes has been mixed and often has limited focus on residual confounding or moderating factors. Methods A systematic review of prospective cohort studies (n\u2009=\u2009>1000) assessing the impact of PAE on neurodevelopmental outcomes was undertaken (neurophysiology, motor skills, cognition, language, academic achievement, memory, attention, executive function, affect regulation, and adaptive behaviour, social skills, or communication). Electronic searches of EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, and Psychinfo were conducted in May 2021. A quality assessment was conducted using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Results Thirty longitudinal cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Evidence of the impact of PAE was mixed across domains. We found no evidence that PAE affects executive function, but there were impacts on motor skills, cognition, language, academic achievement, attention, affect regulation, and adaptive behaviour. The most consistent adverse effect was on affect regulation (nine out of thirteen studies, six of which found an association between heavy alcohol consumption or binge drinking during pregnancy). We found no protective factors. Few studies controlled for variables in the postnatal environment. Discussion This review was unable to conclude a safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Methodological improvements are needed to improve the quality and consistency in which PAE is studied. Further research into residual confounding variables is vital, including a greater focus on the postpartum environment.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction The new European Medical Device Regulation has raised the bar for the clinical evaluation of medical devices to gain marketing authorization by Notified Bodies (NBs) regarding certificates of conformity in Europe. Restrictions applied for High-risk medical devices (HRMD) may require further evidence generation. Some other jurisdictions apply similar schemes that may be useful to the European Union. This systematic review focused on extracting lessons from similar schemes worldwide to the European context. Methods A systematic review of peer-reviewed and gray literature was performed based on \u2018Device approval\u2019 and \u2018conditional approval\u2019 keywords. Databases such as Medline, Embase, and WoS retrieved documents assessed with the AMSTAR-2 checklist. A descriptive and narrative analysis was conducted detailed in CRD42023431233 \u2013 PROSPERO. Results We obtained eight documents where conditional approvals for High-risk medical devices in the United States of America, China, and Canada were subject to generate further evidence. In Europe, NBs impose restrictions or limitations to certificates of conformity instead. Conclusion Further development of policies, supporting access to HRMD subject to further evidence generation, would help Europe in further defining the appropriate situations for the application of determined regulatory routes, to enhance access to HRMD with promising evidence and further evidence development.

    "abstract": "Abstract Issues Despite long\u2010standing recommendations to integrate mental health care and alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment, no prior study has synthesised evidence on the impact of physically co\u2010locating these specialist services on health outcomes. Approach We searched Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science and CINAHL for studies examining health outcomes associated with co\u2010located outpatient mental health care and AOD specialist treatment for adults with a dual diagnosis of substance use disorder and mental illness. Due to diversity in study designs, patient populations and outcome measures among the included studies, we conducted a narrative synthesis. Risk of bias was assessed using the MASTER scale. Key Findings Twenty\u2010eight studies met our inclusion criteria. We found provisional evidence that integrated care that includes co\u2010located mental health care and AOD specialist treatment is associated with reductions in substance use and related harms and mental health symptom severity, improved quality of life, decreased emergency department presentations/hospital admissions and reduced health system expenditure. Many studies had a relatively high risk of bias and it was not possible to disaggregate the independent effect of physical co\u2010location from other common aspects of integrated care models such as care coordination and the integration of service processes. Implications There are few high\u2010quality, peer\u2010reviewed studies establishing the impact of co\u2010located mental health care and AOD specialist treatment on health outcomes. Further research is required to inform policy, guide implementation and optimise practice. Conclusion Integrated care that includes the co\u2010location of mental health care and AOD specialist treatment may yield health and economic benefits.",

    "title": "Health impact of alcohol regulatory interventions: a systematic review of policies in low- and middle-income countries.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption poses significant public health challenges globally, with low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) experiencing a substantial burden from alcohol-related harm. However, the effectiveness of interventions to control alcohol consumption in LMICs remains understudied. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of alcohol regulatory interventions adopted in LMICs. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was conducted on 10 August 2024. The search strategy included terms related to regulatory interventions and their impact on alcohol consumption, health, and other related outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Institutes of Health, Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care checklist, ISPOR-SDMD checklist, and CASP quality assessment tools, and a narrative synthesis was performed to summarize the review findings. Of the 169 full texts screened, 62 studies were included in this review. Most of the studies were conducted in upper-middle-income countries (n = 48, 77%), seven were from lower-middle-income countries, one from a low-income country, and others were combinations of the above. Sixty per cent of the included studies were of good quality. In terms of World Health Organization alcohol policy domains, 18 studies focused on restriction of physical availability, 11 on pricing, 1 on marketing, 21 on drink driving, and 11 on a combination of all policy domains. Alcohol consumption-related outcomes were reported in 26 studies, while health and other outcomes were reported in 25 and 14 studies, respectively. Restrictions on physical availability of alcohol were largely effective across all outcomes, while the pricing policy domain consistently demonstrated effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption. The scarce evidence on marketing policy interventions was inconclusive; interventions targeting drink driving showed beneficial effects. The available evidence suggests that alcohol control policies are largely effective in LMICs. Further regular and statutory enforcement of these interventions is likely to improve their effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "To systematically review the evidence on the impacts of policies regulating the spatial availability of off-premises alcohol on consumption and harms. Narrative review that examined peer-reviewed studies published from 2016 to 2024 on policy changes affecting the spatial availability of off-premises alcohol. Outcomes of interest were alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harms and mortality. The review identified 20 observational studies, primarily natural experiments, examining four policy types: malt liquor restrictions, sales expansion to retail outlets, privatization and changes to allowable alcohol content. Across studies, there was a suggestion that allowing alcohol sales in gas station convenience stores was associated with increased consumption and harms, whereas expanding to grocery stores was not. There was no clear evidence that restricting malt liquor reduces crime. Similarly, privatization was not associated with crime or health outcomes, though it was accompanied by price increases. Increases in allowable alcohol content were not associated with higher consumption, but decreases were associated with fewer alcohol-related emergency visits and hospitalizations. The impact of policy changes in spatial alcohol availability depends on the policy details and retail outlet types. To mitigate public health impacts, policymakers should consider comprehensive alcohol control measures, such as regulating convenience store sales and accompanying grocery store expansions with minimum unit pricing, taxation and marketing restrictions. High-quality natural experiments with pre-post designs, control groups and confounder adjustments are needed to better understand how these policies impact both the general population and high-risk subgroups.",

    "title": "Impacts of EU Tobacco Products Directive regulations on use of e-cigarettes in adolescents in Great Britain: a natural experiment evaluation.",
    "abstract": "E-cigarettes are a popular smoking-cessation tool. Although less harmful than tobacco, use of e-cigarettes by non-smokers should be prevented. There is concern about the use of e-cigarettes by young people and that e-cigarettes may renormalise smoking. In May 2016, Tobacco Products Directive regulations aimed to reduce e-cigarettes' appeal to young people. To examine the effects of the Tobacco Products Directive regulations on young people's use of e-cigarettes, and the role of e-cigarettes in renormalising smoking. A mixed-method natural experimental evaluation combining secondary analyses of survey data, with process evaluation, including interviews with young people, policy stakeholders, retailers and trading standards observers, and observations of retail settings. Wales, Scotland and England. Survey participants were aged 13-15 years, living in England, Scotland or Wales and participated in routinely conducted surveys from 1998 to 2019. Process evaluation participants included 14- to 15-year-olds in England, Scotland and Wales, policy stakeholders, trading standards offices and retailers. Regulation of e-cigarettes, including bans on cross-border advertising, health warnings and restrictions on product strength. Interrupted time series design, with baseline trends as the comparator. The primary outcome was ever e-cigarette use. Secondary outcomes included regular use, ever and regular smoking, smoking attitudes, alcohol and cannabis use. Our primary statistical analysis used data from Wales, including 91,687 young people from the 2013-19 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children and School Health Research Network surveys. In Scotland, we used the Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Use Survey and in England we used the Smoking Drinking and Drug Use surveys. The process evaluation included interviews with 73 young people in 2017 and 148 young people in 2018, 12 policy stakeholders, 13 trading standards officers and 27 retailers. We observed 30 retail premises before and after implementation. Data were integrated using the Medical Research Council's process evaluation framework. Ever smoking continued to decline alongside the emergence of e-cigarettes, with a slight slowing in decline for regular use. Tobacco Products Directive regulations were described by stakeholders as well implemented, and observations indicated good compliance. Young people described e-cigarettes as a fad and indicated limited interaction with the components of the Tobacco Products Directive regulations. In primary statistical analyses in Wales [i.e. short (to 2017) and long term (to 2019)], growth in ever use of e-cigarettes prior to Tobacco Products Directive regulations did not continue after implementation. Change in trend was significant in long-term analysis, although of similar magnitude at both time points (odds ratio 0.96). Data from England and Scotland exhibited a similar pattern. Smoking followed the opposite pattern, declining prior to the Tobacco Products Directive regulations, but plateauing as growth in e-cigarette use stalled. Alternative causal explanations for changes cannot be ruled out because of the observational design. Young people's ever and regular use of e-cigarettes appears to have peaked around the time of the Tobacco Products Directive regulations and may be declining. Although caution is needed in causal attributions, findings are consistent with an effect of regulations. Our analysis provides little evidence that e-cigarettes renormalise smoking. More recent data indicate that declines in smoking are plateauing. International comparative work to understand differences in use of e-cigarettes, and tobacco, within varying regulatory frameworks is a priority. This study is registered as ResearchRegistry4336. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Public Health Research programme and will be published in full in  Much has been achieved in preventing young people smoking; however, e-cigarettes have emerged as a new issue. E-cigarettes can help smokers stop, but might also appeal to young people or make smoking look \u2018normal\u2019. Until recently, In the United Kingdom, there were not many rules for e-cigarettes. In 2016, new rules came in as part of the European Union Tobacco Products Directive regulations. The Tobacco Products Directive regulations limited advertising and included rules about how e-cigarettes should be labelled. In our study, we wanted to know if (1) e-cigarettes make young people think smoking is \u2018normal\u2019 and (2) people\u2019s use of e-cigarettes changed after new rules. We included young people who took part in surveys in England, Scotland and Wales between 1998 and 2019. Overall, about 360,000 young people did one of the surveys and about 90,000 were included in our main analysis. We spoke with young people in 2017 and 2018. In addition, in 2018, we spoke with people involved in tobacco policy, trading standards officers and people who sold e-cigarettes. Young people held negative attitudes about smoking and said that friends disagreed with smoking. Young people approved of occasional social e-cigarette use, but not regular use. Stakeholders described a range of views on how e-cigarettes should be regulated. Retailers and trading standards officers said that some retailers did not get much information about Tobacco Products Directive regulations, but new rules were implemented well. The percentage of young people saying that they had tried e-cigarettes was growing, but the number had stopped growing after the new rules. Regular use remained low throughout. Our findings suggest that e-cigarettes are not making smoking look normal again and new rules may have helped stop growth in use of e-cigarettes by young people.",

    "title": "The impact of legal cannabis availability on cannabis use and health outcomes: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "For alcohol, regulating availability is an effective way to reduce consumption and harm. Similarly, the higher availability of medical cannabis dispensaries has been linked to increased cannabis consumption and harm. For recreational cannabis markets, such a link is suspected but still poorly understood. A systematic literature review (PROSPERO registration number 342357) was conducted on 1 July 2022 in common libraries (Medline, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Psyndex, CINAHL, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane) for publications since 2012. Studies linking variations in the availability of legal cannabis products to behavioral outcomes (cannabis use or related health indicators) were included, while studies focusing solely on the legalization of medical cannabis were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale. After screening n\u00a0=\u00a06,253 studies, n\u00a0=\u00a0136 were selected for full-text review, out of which n\u00a0=\u00a013 met the inclusion criteria, reporting on n\u00a0=\u00a0333,550 study participants and n\u00a0=\u00a0855,630 presentations to emergency departments. All studies were conducted in North America, with the majority from Western US states. Using longitudinal (n\u00a0=\u00a01), cross-sectional (n\u00a0=\u00a04), or repeated cross-sectional (n\u00a0=\u00a08) study designs, an increased availability of legal cannabis was linked to increased current cannabis use and health-related outcomes (vomiting, psychosis, or cannabis-involved pregnancies), regardless of the indicator employed to measure availability (proximity or density) among both adults and adolescents. The positive correlation between cannabis availability and consumption is most pronounced among those groups who have been less exposed to cannabis before legalization. The association between the availability of legal cannabis and risky use indicators was less consistent. Groups who have been least exposed to cannabis before legalization may be most susceptible to increased availability. In jurisdictions with legal cannabis markets, restrictions on the number of legal cannabis retailers, especially in densely populated areas, appear warranted.",

    "title": "Advertising and Young People's Critical Reasoning Abilities: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Young people are exposed to an abundance of advertising for unhealthy products (eg, unhealthy foods, tobacco, alcohol). Because of their developing cognition, children may not be able to understand the intent of advertising. However, advertising restrictions often assume that adolescents have critical reasoning capacity and can resist the effects of advertising. This review seeks to assess whether the evidence supports this assumption. Ten databases were searched in December 2020. Inclusion criteria were participants aged 6 to 17 years, any advertising exposure, objectively measured understanding or attitudinal outcome, a comparison, control, and between-group comparison. This study included all languages and excluded studies published pre-2010. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Thirty-eight articles were included. Meta-analysis of 9 studies with attitudinal outcomes indicated that unhealthy product advertising generated more positive brand or product attitudes compared with neutral or no advertising control in all ages. There were significant effects for digital and nondigital advertising formats. We found greater understanding did not protect against the impact of advertising on brand or product attitudes. Limitations include the inability to meta-analyze the impact of advertising on understanding or the influence of age. Evidence shows that the attitudes of young people were influenced by advertising. Critical reasoning abilities did not appear to be fully developed during adolescence and not found to be protective against the impact of advertising. Policymakers should ensure regulations to restrict marketing of unhealthy commodities protects adolescents as well as younger children.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Mass Media Campaigns to Reduce Alcohol Consumption and Harm: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "To assess the effectiveness of mass media messages to reduce alcohol consumption and related harms using a systematic literature review. Eight databases were searched along with reference lists of eligible studies. Studies of any design in any country were included, provided that they evaluated a mass media intervention targeting alcohol consumption or related behavioural, social cognitive or clinical outcomes. Drink driving interventions and college campus campaigns were ineligible. Studies quality were assessed, data were extracted and a narrative synthesis conducted. Searches produced 10,212 results and 24 studies were included in the review. Most campaigns used TV or radio in combination with other media channels were conducted in developed countries and were of weak quality. There was little evidence of reductions in alcohol consumption associated with exposure to campaigns based on 13 studies which measured consumption, although most did not state this as a specific aim of the campaign. There were some increases in treatment seeking and information seeking and mixed evidence of changes in intentions, motivation, beliefs and attitudes about alcohol. Campaigns were associated with increases in knowledge about alcohol consumption, especially where levels had initially been low. Recall of campaigns was high. Mass media health campaigns about alcohol are often recalled by individuals, have achieved changes in knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about alcohol but there is little evidence of reductions in alcohol consumption. There is little evidence that mass media campaigns have reduced alcohol consumption although most did not state that they aimed to do so. Studies show recall of campaigns is high and that they can have an impact on knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about alcohol consumption.",

    "title": "Tobacco packaging design for reducing tobacco use.",
    "abstract": "Tobacco use is the largest single preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Standardised tobacco packaging is an intervention intended to reduce the promotional appeal of packs and can be defined as packaging with a uniform colour (and in some cases shape and size) with no logos or branding, apart from health warnings and other government-mandated information, and the brand name in a prescribed uniform font, colour and size. Australia was the first country to implement standardised tobacco packaging between October and December 2012, France implemented standardised tobacco packaging on 1 January 2017 and several other countries are implementing, or intending to implement, standardised tobacco packaging. To assess the effect of standardised tobacco packaging on tobacco use uptake, cessation and reduction. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and six other databases from 1980 to January 2016. We checked bibliographies and contacted study authors to identify additional peer-reviewed studies. Primary outcomes included changes in tobacco use prevalence incorporating tobacco use uptake, cessation, consumption and relapse prevention. Secondary outcomes covered intermediate outcomes that can be measured and are relevant to tobacco use uptake, cessation or reduction. We considered multiple study designs: randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental and experimental studies, observational cross-sectional and cohort studies. The review focused on all populations and people of any age; to be included, studies had to be published in peer-reviewed journals. We examined studies that assessed the impact of changes in tobacco packaging such as colour, design, size and type of health warnings on the packs in relation to branded packaging. In experiments, the control condition was branded tobacco packaging but could include variations of standardised packaging. Screening and data extraction followed standard Cochrane methods. We used different 'Risk of bias' domains for different study types. We have summarised findings narratively. Fifty-one studies met our inclusion criteria, involving approximately 800,000 participants. The studies included were diverse, including observational studies, between- and within-participant experimental studies, cohort and cross-sectional studies, and time-series analyses. Few studies assessed behavioural outcomes in youth and non-smokers. Five studies assessed the primary outcomes: one observational study assessed smoking prevalence among 700,000 participants until one year after standardised packaging in Australia; four studies assessed consumption in 9394 participants, including a series of Australian national cross-sectional surveys of 8811 current smokers, in addition to three smaller studies. No studies assessed uptake, cessation, or relapse prevention. Two studies assessed quit attempts. Twenty studies examined other behavioural outcomes and 45 studies examined non-behavioural outcomes (e.g. appeal, perceptions of harm). In line with the challenges inherent in evaluating standardised tobacco packaging, a number of methodological imitations were apparent in the included studies and overall we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. The one included study assessing the impact of standardised tobacco packaging on smoking prevalence in Australia found a 3.7% reduction in odds when comparing before to after the packaging change, or a 0.5 percentage point drop in smoking prevalence, when adjusting for confounders. Confidence in this finding is limited, due to the nature of the evidence available, and is therefore rated low by GRADE standards. Findings were mixed amongst the four studies assessing consumption, with some studies finding no difference and some studies finding evidence of a decrease; certainty in this outcome was rated very low by GRADE standards due to the limitations in study design. One national study of Australian adult smoker cohorts (5441 participants) found that quit attempts increased from 20.2% prior to the introduction of standardised packaging to 26.6% one year post-implementation. A second study of calls to quitlines provides indirect support for this finding, with a 78% increase observed in the number of calls after the implementation of standardised packaging. Here again, certainty is low. Studies of other behavioural outcomes found evidence of increased avoidance behaviours when using standardised packs, reduced demand for standardised packs and reduced craving. Evidence from studies measuring eye-tracking showed increased visual attention to health warnings on standardised compared to branded packs. Corroborative evidence for the latter finding came from studies assessing non-behavioural outcomes, which in general found greater warning salience when viewing standardised, than branded packs. There was mixed evidence for quitting cognitions, whereas findings with youth generally pointed towards standardised packs being less likely to motivate smoking initiation than branded packs. We found the most consistent evidence for appeal, with standardised packs rating lower than branded packs. Tobacco in standardised packs was also generally perceived as worse-tasting and lower quality than tobacco in branded packs. Standardised packaging also appeared to reduce misperceptions that some cigarettes are less harmful than others, but only when dark colours were used for the uniform colour of the pack. The available evidence suggests that standardised packaging may reduce smoking prevalence. Only one country had implemented standardised packaging at the time of this review, so evidence comes from one large observational study that provides evidence for this effect. A reduction in smoking behaviour is supported by routinely collected data by the Australian government. Data on the effects of standardised packaging on non-behavioural outcomes (e.g. appeal) are clearer and provide plausible mechanisms of effect consistent with the observed decline in prevalence. As standardised packaging is implemented in different countries, research programmes should be initiated to capture long term effects on tobacco use prevalence, behaviour, and uptake. We did not find any evidence suggesting standardised packaging may increase tobacco use.",

    "abstract": "An updated zoning policy eliminating all alcohol outlets (liquor stores) in residential districts was implemented to reduce high rates of violent crime in Baltimore City. Diverse stakeholders were engaged in group model building (GMB) activities to develop causal loop diagrams (CLDs) that elucidate the impact of the new zoning policy on crime, and more broadly, the potentially unintended social and environmental consequences of the policy. Three distinct groups, community advocates, city officials/academics, and community residents, participated in three separate GMB sessions. Three CLDs, one from each stakeholder group, were created to depict the possible outcomes of the zoning policy. Our findings offer insight into potential unintended consequences of removing liquor stores from residential areas that may undermine the policy. Community members described the need for additional supports related to mental health and substance use, opportunities for investment in the community, access to other goods and services, and community-police relations to ensure the policy achieved its intended goal of reducing violent crime. Our findings highlight the importance of timely engagement of local stakeholders to understand how complex neighborhood dynamics and contextual factors could impact the effectiveness of a zoning policy change.",

    "title": "Surveying Alcohol Outlet Density in Four Neighborhoods of Beirut Lebanon: Implications for Future Research and National Policy",
    "abstract": "Underage drinking among youth in Lebanon is increasing. Regulating availability is one of the best buy policies recommended by the World Health Organization. To quantitatively document the current status of alcohol availability to youth in Lebanon, we used GPS technology to survey alcohol outlet density in four highly populated neighborhoods in Beirut, Lebanon, and to estimate their proximity to educational institutions. The density of alcohol outlets ranged from 18.30 to 80.95 per km2 (average of 39.6 alcohol outlets/km2). The highest number of total alcohol outlets was in the \u201cHamra & Jamiaa\u201d area, which includes one of the largest private universities in the country. Thirteen out of 109 (12%) alcohol outlets (on and off-premise) were located less 100 m away from educational institutions, in violation of the current licensing law. None of the off-premise and the majority (94%) of on-premise alcohol outlets displayed the \u201cno sale for <18\u201d sign. Findings were indicative of an environment conducive to increased access and availability of alcohol among youth in Lebanon probably attributed to the prevailing weak alcohol policies and their enforcement. Systematic collection and reporting of alcohol outlet densities is critical to understand the alcogenic environment and guide local harm reduction policies.",

    "title": "Change in alcohol outlet density and alcohol-related harm to population health (CHALICE): a comprehensive record-linked database study in Wales",
    "abstract": "Excess alcohol consumption has many adverse effects on health, including an increased risk of liver\r\ncirrhosis, gastrointestinal tract and breast cancers, high blood pressure and stroke. There is also an\r\nincreased risk of harm resulting from antisocial behaviour and violence. Binge drinking is a particular\r\nproblem, with the highest prevalence in the 16- to 24-year age group for women and men. Up to 40% of\r\nattendances at accident and emergency (A&E) departments and around half of all violent crimes in the UK\r\nare alcohol related.\r\nAround 37% of men and 25% of women exceeded UK guidelines for safe levels of alcohol consumption\r\nin 2014 (women more than three units per day; men more than four units per day) and 19% of men and\r\n11% of women binge drink (women more than six units per day; men more than eight units per day).\r\nGiven the wide range of harm resulting from this substantial level of excess consumption, the potential\r\nimpact on health at the population level from a reduction in consumption is considerable.\r\nOne of the principal policies recommended by the British Medical Association to reduce alcohol\r\nconsumption is to reduce easy access to alcohol through controls on hours of sale and outlet density. This\r\nuses the availability theory of alcohol-related harm, which states that harmful outcomes are linked directly\r\nor indirectly to a greater availability of alcohol, through a higher density of alcohol outlets, leading to\r\nhigher consumption and hence alcohol-related harm.\r\nHowever, the evidence relating outlet density to alcohol-related harm is not consistent. Many cross-sectional\r\nstudies have suggested that high outlet densities are associated with a higher rate of a wide range of\r\nalcohol-related injuries. Fewer studies have investigated associations between outlet density and non-injury\r\nhealth outcomes, suggesting that high outlet densities are associated with high levels of consumption,\r\nsexually transmitted infections and alcohol-related hospital admissions. There have been few longitudinal\r\nstudies but these have provided limited evidence that an increase in outlet density is associated with\r\nincreased consumption and interpersonal violence and that a decrease in proximity to outlets is associated\r\nwith a small decrease in consumption. No longitudinal studies of admissions to hospital have been published\r\nfor non-violent outcomes. Many methodological questions remain over the best way to measure outlet\r\ndensity and how to model the relationship with alcohol-related harms. Little is known about the effects of\r\na change in outlet density on inequalities in alcohol-related health and the role of population migration.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate the association between the alcohol outlet density in residential areas and the current and lifetime alcohol consumption, adjusted for individual and family factors.\n\n\nMETHOD\nInformation from a three-stage household stratified probabilistic cluster sampling survey (census tract, household, adult and adolescent), conducted in Belo Horizonte, Brazil (\"Health in BH\", 2008-2009) and data of the establishments were obtained from official sources and subsequently georeferenced. The outcome was the adolescents' report of current and lifetime alcohol consumption. The exposure variable was the alcohol outlet density, defined as the number of establishments within a 200-meter range from the adolescents' residence. The association was estimated by Poisson regression adjusted by individual and family variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 601 adolescents aged 14 to 17 years were included in this study. Of these, 53.3% were males and 71.0% lived in a family with income up to five minimum wages. The prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption was 57.0% (95%CI 51.5 - 62.6) and the current was 11.9% (95%CI 8.7 - 15.0). The multivariate analysis showed a significant association between current alcohol consumption and density of snack bars (PR = 1.13; 95%CI 1.03 - 1.24), bars (PR = 1.21; 95CI% 1.05 - 1.38), and restaurants (PR = 1.11; 95%CI 1.02 - 1.21). Significant interactions between density of establishments with sex and age were found.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCurrent alcohol consumption may be enhanced by the availability of some types of establishments located within a range of 200 meters from the adolescents' residence.",

    "title": "A Spatial Analysis of Alcohol Outlet Density Type, Abandoned Properties, and Police Calls on Aggravated Assault Rates in a Northeastern U.S. City",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Community-based research and prevention scholarship has shown a growing interest in examining the impact of the ecological structure of neighborhoods on community violence. Ecological structures such as higher numbers of alcohol outlets and abandoned/vacant properties in geographically dense, poor, and socially isolated communities are critically important to consider. Further, disadvantaged urban communities are burdened by greater police presence with limited or no abatement in crime or violence. Purpose: Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, spatial analysis techniques, and a negative binomial regression analyses, this study investigated the relationships between alcohol outlet density consisting of license C (i.e., combined on and off premises establishments) and license D (i.e., off premises establishments such as liquor stores), abandoned properties, and police calls to service on aggravated assault rates in a Northeastern United States urban city. Results: Negative binomial regression analysis results showed that license C alcohol outlet density count (IRR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.08, 2.11), license D alcohol outlet density count (IRR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.30), abandoned property count (IRR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.01, 2.01), and police call to service counts (IRR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.50) were positively associated with aggravated assault rates. Analyses controlled for census data characteristics. Conclusions: The link between alcohol outlet density and violent crime has been established in public health research. However, this study represents an important contribution in recognizing the unique relationships between license C and license D alcohol outlet density, abandoned properties, and police calls to service with aggravated assaults in an urban neighborhood. Conclusions are drawn for policy and practice.",

    "title": "The Violence Prevention Potential of Reducing Alcohol Outlet Access in Baltimore, Maryland.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThere are few cost-effectiveness analyses that model alcohol outlet zoning policies. This study determines the potential decreases in homicides, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and victim and criminal justice costs associated with four policy options that would reduce the alcohol outlet access in Baltimore.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThis cost-effectiveness analysis used associations between on-premise (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.41), off-premise (IRR = 1.76), and combined on- and off-premise outlet density (IRR = 1.07) and homicide in Baltimore. We determined the potential change in the level of homicide that could occur with changes in the density of alcohol outlets, assuming that 50% of the association was causal.\n\n\nRESULTS\nReducing alcohol outlet density in Baltimore City by one quintile was associated with decreases of 51 homicides per year, $63.7 million, and 764 DALYs. Removing liquor stores in residential zones was associated with 22 fewer homicides, which would cost $27.5 million and lead to 391 DALYs. Removing bars/taverns operating as liquor stores was associated with a decrease of one homicide, $1.2 million, and 17 DALYs. Removing both the liquor stores in residential zones and the bars/taverns operating as liquor stores was associated with 23 fewer homicides, which translated to $28.7 million and 409 DALYs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFor preventing homicides, the strategy of removing liquor stores in residential zones was preferred because it was associated with substantial reductions in homicides without closing unacceptably high numbers of outlets. It is possible that policies that close the bars/taverns operating as liquor stores would be associated with decreases in other types of violent crime.",

A key element determining alcohol availability is alcohol outlet density. This study investigated the relationship between on\u2010trade and off\u2010trade outlets and hospital admission rates in local neighbourhoods. Design National small\u2010area level ecological study. Setting and participants All 32\u2009482 lower layer super output census areas (LSOAs) in England (42\u2009227\u2009108 million people aged 15+ years). Densities for six outlet categories (outlets within a 1\u2010km radius of residential postcode centroids, averaged for all postcodes within each LSOA) were calculated. Measurements Main outcome measures were admissions due to acute or chronic conditions wholly or partially attributable to alcohol consumption from 2002/03 to 2013/14. Findings There were 1\u2009007\u2009137 admissions wholly, and 2\u2009153\u2009874 admissions partially, attributable to alcohol over 12 years. After adjustment for confounding, higher densities of on\u2010trade outlets (pubs, bars and nightclubs; restaurants licensed to sell alcohol; other on\u2010trade outlets) and convenience stores were associated with higher admission rate ratios for acute and chronic wholly attributable conditions. For acute wholly attributable conditions, admission rate ratios were 13% (95% confidence interval = 11\u201315%), 9% (7\u201310%), 12% (10\u201314%) and 10% (9\u201312%) higher, respectively, in the highest relative to the lowest density categories by quartile. For chronic wholly attributable conditions, rate ratios were 22% (21\u201324%), 9% (7\u201311%), 19% (17\u201321%) and 7% (6\u20139%) higher, respectively. Supermarket density was associated with modestly higher acute and chronic admissions but other off\u2010trade outlet density was associated only with higher admissions for chronic wholly attributable conditions. For partially attributable conditions, there were no strong patterns of association with outlet densities. Conclusions In England, higher densities of several categories of alcohol outlets appear to be associated with higher hospital admission rates for conditions wholly attributable to alcohol consumption.",

    "title": "A cross-sectional analysis of the relationship between tobacco and alcohol outlet density and neighbourhood deprivation",
    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a strong socio-economic gradient in both tobacco-and alcohol-related harm. One possible factor contributing to this social gradient may be greater availability of tobacco and alcohol in more socially-deprived areas. A higher density of tobacco and alcohol outlets is not only likely to increase supply but also to raise awareness of tobacco/alcohol brands, create a competitive local market that reduces product costs, and influence local social norms relating to tobacco and alcohol consumption. This paper examines the association between the density of alcohol and tobacco outlets and neighbourhood-level income deprivation.MethodsUsing a national tobacco retailer register and alcohol licensing data this paper calculates the density of alcohol and tobacco retail outlets per 10,000 population for small neighbourhoods across the whole of Scotland. Average outlet density was calculated for neighbourhoods grouped by their level of income deprivation. Associations between outlet density and deprivation were analysed using one way analysis of variance.ResultsThere was a positive linear relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and outlets for both tobacco (p <0.001) and off-sales alcohol (p <0.001); the most deprived quintile of neighbourhoods had the highest densities of both. In contrast, the least deprived quintile had the lowest density of tobacco and both off-sales and on-sales alcohol outlets.ConclusionsThe social gradient evident in alcohol and tobacco supply may be a contributing factor to the social gradient in alcohol-\u00a0and tobacco-related disease. Policymakers should consider such gradients when creating tobacco and alcohol control policies. The potential contribution to public health, and health inequalities, of reducing the physical availability of both alcohol and tobacco products should be examined in developing broader supply-side interventions.",

    "title": "Global alcohol policy implementation in Thailand: A narrative review",
    "abstract": "Alcohol consumption is growing in emerging economies. Thailand is an upper-middle-income emerging economy in Southeast Asia where the alcohol market has been under an oligopoly, which political groups are attempting to amend. The Thai Ministry of Public Health works in close partnership with the non-profit sector in alcohol control, and has recently adapted the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) SAFER initiatives as part of the national alcohol agenda. In light of these ongoing changes, we conducted a narrative review with the following objectives: (1) to describe the development of alcohol control policy strategies in Thailand; and (2) to describe the current situation on alcohol policy implementation. We performed a search of the published and grey literature in both Thai and English languages using keywords related to topics of interest, and reviewed data on SAFER's effectiveness using a group of indicators (policy-attributable health outcomes). We found that Thailand has laws and regulations covering various domains of SAFER. However, gaps do exist with regard to regulation of alcohol outlet density, relatively low alcohol sales permit fees, control of online and surrogate marketing of alcoholic products, and enforcement of drinking-and-driving deterrence measures, among others. A review of the indicators showed that annual per capita alcohol consumption (APC) and prevalence of drinkers have remained constant since 2008, whereas the prevalence of binge-drinking has been on a decline since 2014. However, deaths attributable to alcohol have increased in both men and women. The findings of this narrative review may have implications for policymakers and stakeholders in behavioral health.",

The aim of this study was to examine whether the complete ban on alcohol advertising in Norway in 1975 had any effect on total alcohol sales.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAnnual time series of recorded alcohol sales (1960-2006) were analysed. Autoregressive integrated moving average interrupted time series techniques were used to model the effect of the advertising ban, adjusting for alcohol prices and wages.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe autoregressive integrated moving average analyses showed a negative and statistically significant effect of the ban on total recorded alcohol sales, suggesting an immediate and lasting reduction of 7.4% (P =\u20090.002).\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe complete ban on alcohol advertising in 1975 in Norway reduced recorded alcohol sales. This suggests that the ban had a protective effect by reducing total alcohol consumption. The conclusion remains tentative because of possible effects of unrecorded alcohol consumption and marketing on social media and satellite TV channels.",

    "title": "Regulating alcohol advertising for public health and welfare in the age of digital marketing: challenges and options",
    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: This narrative review considers traditional strategies for regulating alcohol marketing and their applicability to digital media. Method: Drawing on international research, case studies, and reports, we examine the applicability of (1) comprehensive or partial bans; (2) placement restrictions; (3) content restrictions; and (4) counter-advertising. Results: Comprehensive bans on advertising are generally the most effective option. A partial ban applying to digital media would make some lesser contribution to reducing exposure, but will usually simply result in the promotional budget being shifted to whichever media remain less strictly regulated. Limits on the placement of marketing have more salience for traditional media than for most digital media, which can be individualized and targeted. Content restrictions play a limited role in reducing exposure as they are not concerned with marketing volume, but with the way in which alcohol is represented. Conclusions: Although these traditional strategies have a role in regulating digital media and are applied in certain international jurisdictions, new regulatory approaches are needed. These may include the use of artificial intelligence for monitoring, transparency requirements, and privacy law rights and duties. Opportunities to regulate alcohol marketing online will need to be addressed and seized as they arise in the current volatile policy environment concerning the governance of social media.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nFrance's \u00c9vin law limits the content of alcohol advertising to purely factual product information. Little research to date has examined the effectiveness of this measure. To address this gap, we investigated the effect on young people of (a) content restrictions in general, (b) more or less strict content regulations, and (c) whether different youth profiles are more or less susceptible to content regulations.\n\n\nMETHOD\nAn online experimental survey on 18- to 25-year-olds in France was conducted (n = 2,163). Participants were exposed to three advertising conditions for four alcohol brands: (a) neutral ads with only bottles and logos (in line with \u00c9vin law restrictions); (b) contextual ads (partying and sport iconography) without characters; and (c) contextual ads featuring characters. Participants self-reported their reactions on attention, appeal, product, alcohol consumption perception, image benefits, and perceived behavioral impact. Demographics and alcohol use measures were also collected.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor almost all reactions, ads that featured sport or party contexts (with/without characters) generated more positive reactions and more perceived behavioral impact compared with neutral ads. Ads that featured characters had more positive reactions than ads without characters. Women and the youngest segment (18-21 years old) emerged as the most sensitive to contextual ads.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRegulating alcohol advertising content via strongly prohibitive measures, as per France's \u00c9vin law in 1991 or similar measures in other countries, is an effective policy direction for protecting vulnerable young people. This approach should be considered by countries that currently have only partial bans on alcohol advertising placement.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use is a leading risk factor for death and disability and there is a need for evidence-based policy measures to tackle excess alcohol consumption and related harms. The aim of this study was to examine attitudes towards alcohol control measures among the general public in the context of significant reforms undertaken in the Irish alcohol policymaking landscape. Methods A representative household survey was conducted among individuals aged 18+ years in Ireland. Descriptive and univariate analyses were used. Results A total of 1069 participants took part (48% male) and there was broad support (>50%) for evidence-based alcohol policies. Support was strongest for a ban on alcohol advertising near schools and creches (85.1%) and for warning labels (81.9%). Women were more likely than men to support alcohol control policy measures while participants with harmful alcohol use patterns were significantly less likely to support these measures. Respondents with a greater awareness of the health risks of alcohol showed higher levels of support, while those who had experienced harms due to other people\u2019s drinking showed lower support compared with those who had not experienced such harms. Conclusions This study provides evidence of support for alcohol control policies in Ireland. However, notable differences were found in levels of support according to sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol consumption patterns, knowledge of health risks and harms experienced. Further research on reasons behind public support towards alcohol control measures would be worthwhile, given the importance of public opinion in the development of alcohol policy.",

    "abstract": "To systematically assess the Canadian federal government\u2019s current alcohol policies in relation to public health best practices. The 2022 Canadian Alcohol Policy Evaluation (CAPE) Project assessed federal alcohol policies across 10 domains. Policy domains were weighted according to evidence for their relative impact, including effectiveness and scope. A detailed scoring rubric of best practices was developed and externally reviewed by international experts. Policy data were collected between June and December 2022, using official legislation, government websites, and data sources identified from previous iterations of CAPE as sources. Contacts within relevant government departments provided any additional data sources, reviewed the accuracy and completeness of the data, and provided amendments as needed. Data were scored independently by members of the research team. Final policy scores were tabulated and presented as a weighted overall average score and as unweighted domain-specific scores. Compared to public health best practices, the federal government of Canada scored 37% overall. The three most impactful domains\u2014(1) pricing and taxation, (2) marketing and advertising controls, and (3) impaired driving countermeasures\u2014received some of the lowest scores (39%, 10%, and 40%, respectively). Domain-specific scores varied considerably from 0% for minimum legal age policies to 100% for controls on physical availability of alcohol. Many evidence-informed alcohol policies have not been adopted, or been adopted only partially, by the Canadian federal government. Urgent adoption of the recommended policies is needed to prevent and reduce the enormous health, social, and economic costs of alcohol use in Canada.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While it is presumed that alcohol marketing policies decrease adolescent exposure to alcohol advertising, scientific literature on the topic is sparse. The current study sought to determine if alcohol marketing policy strength in the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) region of the Americas was associated with adolescent alcohol ad exposure. A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the Global School-based Health Survey and the WHO\u2019s Global Information System on Alcohol and Health . Linear regression was used, and the analysis included country-level (i.e. other alcohol policies, human development index (HDI), pattern of drinking score (PDS)) and individual-level (i.e. participant age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), lifetime drinking status) covariates. Among 47,195 adolescents, 11\u201316\u2009years old, from 13 countries, marketing policy strength was inversely associated with alcohol ad exposure (\u03b2 (95% confidence interval (CI)) = \u22120.82 (\u22120.96, \u22120.68), p\u2009<\u2009.001). Other alcohol control measures, HDI, PDS, and participant SES were also inversely associated with exposure (p\u2019s <\u2009.001). As presumed, alcohol marketing policies may reduce adolescent exposure to alcohol advertising, and countries should consider including strong marketing restrictions, or complete marketing bans, when implementing alcohol control policies in their effort to meet the sustainable development goals.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential impact on health and economic outcomes of optimizing a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Methods: We built a probabilistic microsimulation model, considering natural history, direct health system costs, and quality of life impairment associated with main tobacco-related diseases. We followed individuals in hypothetical cohorts and calculated health outcomes on an annual basis to obtain aggregated 10-year population health outcomes (deaths, events, healthy years of life) and costs. To populate the model, we performed a rapid review of literature to calculate intervention effectiveness. Results: With current policies, over 10 years, in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia a total of 50,000 deaths and 364,000 disease events will be averted, saving $7.2 billion. If the seven countries strengthened their policies and implemented a comprehensive ban with 100% compliance, 98,000 deaths and 648,000 events would be averted over 10 years, saving almost $15 billion in healthcare costs. Conclusions: Optimizing a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship would substantially reduce deaths, diseases, and health care costs attributed to smoking. Latin American countries should not delay the full implementation of this strategy.",

    "title": "Alcohol ban during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: Lessons for preventing foetal alcohol spectrum disorder in South Africa",
    "abstract": "During the two national lockdowns implemented in South Africa to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages were prohibited. There is observational evidence from the literature suggesting a drastic reduction in the emergency and trauma unit admissions in many South African hospitals and clinics with alcohol-related restrictions. This article explores the potential benefits of the restrictions placed on the sale and consumption of alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic on preventing foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) in South Africa. Following the potential benefits of the alcohol bans, we recommended that the current South African national liquor policy and the 2012 South African government-drafted Bill for Control of Marketing of Alcoholic Beverages should be fully implemented and enforced. Furthermore, the \u2018best buys\u2019 by the World Health Organization (WHO) should be adapted (based on local evidence) and executed. Implementing the abovementioned policies can reduce alcohol abuse by limiting and regulating the manufacturing, distribution, advertising, sponsorship, promotion, physical availability and hours of sale of alcoholic beverages in South Africa. Contribution This article shows that alcohol bans during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown reduced the short-term effects of alcohol. We believe that this could be a game-changer for the prevention of FASD in South Africa and positively impact the incidence and prevalence of FASD. This piece provides evidence that policymakers, health practitioners and academics can use to continue advocating for stricter alcohol control measures in South Africa.",

    "title": "Alcohol Advertising, Promotion, and Sponsorship: A Review of Regulatory Policies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe expansion of transnational alcohol corporations (TACs) in Southeast Asia has been suggested as a possible contributor to increased alcohol advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (AAPS), which in turn may have contributed to increasing rates of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems. The aim of this scoping review is to document the growth of TACs in the region and to critically evaluate the development of alcohol policies to regulate AAPS in 10 Southeast Asian nations.\n\n\nMETHOD\nNational policies related to AAPS were reviewed using data from the Global Information System on Alcohol and Health, following the framework of the WHO Global Strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. The policy review was supplemented with data from corporate annual reports, press releases, four databases of academic literature, market research from Euromonitor International, and news articles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFour TACs--Carlsberg, Diageo, Heineken, and San Miguel--have been expanding operations in Southeast Asia by setting up new breweries, acquiring local alcohol companies as subsidiaries, and entering into joint ventures. In contrast, policies for regulating AAPS vary across Southeast Asia and range from nonexistent to strong control of AAPS. There is strong control of AAPS in countries with existing legislation ranging from a complete ban (Brunei) to almost comprehensive bans (Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos) and partial bans (Thailand). Nonexistent to weak control of AAPS is observed in the Philippines, Singapore, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, which mostly rely on voluntary regulation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe study's findings point to the growing power of TACs in the region and call for the need for stronger measures based on scientific evidence of effectiveness that are implemented without interference from commercial interests.",

    "abstract": "Background Alcohol contributes to poor health, social and economic outcomes among adolescents. In Malawi, alcohol consumption among young people significantly increased after the introduction of alcohol sachets. A government ban on the sale of alcohol sachets affected in 2012 aimed to reduce prevalence of alcohol among users. We explored adolescents perceptions regarding the effectiveness of the ban towards reducing alcohol consumption among the under aged in the country. Methods Using a descriptive phenomenological school-based approach, we recruited 44 school-going adolescents, 15\u201317\u2009year olds using snow ball sampling and conducted 12 individual semi-structured interviews and four group discussions differentiated by sex. We sought a waiver from College of Medicine Ethics Committee (COMREC) to obtain verbal consent from adolescents. All interviews and discussions were digitally recorded and simultaneously transcribed and translated verbatim into English. Data management and analysis was done manually using thematic approach. Results Aggressive packaging, and marketing tendencies and lack of restrictive measures in Malawi have rendered the ban ineffective through increased affordability and availability to different income population groups and the underage. Results indicate that even though adolescents perceive the ban as a significant step towards reducing under age alcohol use, personality and drinking motives precede any interventions. Adolescents emphasized on strong personality as a significant factor for reduced alcohol intake or abstinence. Conclusions We recommend strict alcohol policy and enforcement regarding packaging, pricing, positive role modelling by parents and enhanced adolescent personality development through schools and families.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship bans on smoking prevalence, initiation and cessation: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship (TAPS) have the potential to influence smoking behaviour. However, many countries are yet to implement such strategies. Objective This study aimed to synthesise contemporary evidence on the effectiveness of TAPS bans on smoking prevalence, initiation and cessation. Data sources Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched up to 11 April 2024. Sixteen eligible studies were included. Data selection and extraction Two reviewers independently screened each study and extracted relevant data. Quality assessment was performed in duplicate using the ROBINS-I tool. Discrepancies were resolved via consensus or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted for reasonably comparable studies. Data synthesis The meta-analyses showed that TAPS bans were associated with a lower prevalence of current smoking (pooled OR= 0.80, 95%\u2009CI 0.68 to 0.95, I 2=98.7%) and a reduced risk of smoking initiation (pooled HR=0.63, 95%\u2009CI 0.48 to 0.82, I 2=95%). There was no association between TAPS bans and smoking cessation (pooled OR=1.10, 95%\u2009CI 0.86 to 1.40, I2 =58.5%). Subgroup analyses revealed the effects of TAPS bans on smoking prevalence differed by duration of evaluation (p<0.01). Conclusions This review showed that TAPS bans were associated with a 20% lower odds of current smoking and a 37% reduced risk of smoking initiation. The available evidence suggests that TAPS bans influence smoking behaviour, which strengthens calls for the implementation and enforcement of these policies.",

    "title": "Industry Actor Use of Research Evidence: Critical Analysis of Australian Alcohol Policy Submissions.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nGovernments' limited adoption of evidence-based policies to reduce alcohol-related harm has been partly attributed to alcohol industry influence. A better understanding of industry political strategy may help protect public policy against vested interests. We examined how industry actors used scientific evidence in their submissions to government alcohol policy consultations.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe conducted a content analysis of 214 submissions from industry actors in 21 Australian public consultations between 2013 and 2017. Represented industry actors included alcohol producers and retailers, trade associations, licensees, and associated entities that derive commercial benefit from alcohol (e.g., advertising companies). Adapting an existing framework, we classified industry practices into two categories: (a) misuse of evidence and (b) denial of the effectiveness of evidence-based strategies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlmost all submissions (91%) denied the effectiveness of evidence-based strategies; the most common denial practices were making unsubstantiated claims about adverse effects of policies (76%) and promoting alternatives without evidence (71%). The misuse of scientific evidence was apparent in 66% of submissions. Trade associations, producers, and retailers were most likely to use such practices.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe extent to which the examined industry actors misused scientific evidence in their submissions to a wide range of alcohol policy consultations in Australia suggests the need for governments to consider excluding the industry from consultation on the regulation of alcohol.",

    "title": "Analysis of the Alcohol Industry's Corporate Social Responsibility Practices in Portugal.",
    "abstract": "In Portugal, the alcohol industry (AI) engages in corporate political activity, influencing decision-making and potentially obstructing the implementation of evidence-based alcohol policies, such as higher taxes, stricter advertising laws, and mandatory warning labels on all alcoholic beverages. Yet, no research has been conducted specifically on the industry's corporate social responsibility activities (CSR), which can also hinder the implementation of these cost-effective policies while serving as a means for nurturing its reputation. This study addresses this gap by examining the CSR practices of ten AI actors in Portugal. Through qualitative content analysis, data collected from their websites was categorized based on an adapted framework considering seven CSR categories. The results revealed CSR practices across all categories, with corporate philanthropy and alcohol information provision and education accounting for 65% of the analyzed data. The findings highlight potential conflicts between the public health initiatives of AI in Portugal and its profit-driven objectives. CSR activities undermine health protection and alcohol harm prevention efforts by promoting a dubious discourse about an undeniably harmful substance. The present study recommends considering vigilant monitoring, regulation, or even the ban on CSR practices of AI in Portugal.

    "title": "Prioritising research on marketing and consumption of No and Low (NoLo) alcoholic beverages in Ireland.",
    "abstract": "Advertising of zero/no and low-strength (NoLo) alcohol brands is becoming increasingly common in Ireland, but empirical research to determine their impact is lacking. Although the Public Health (Alcohol) Act (2018) prohibits advertising alcohol on or within 200 m of buses, trains, schools and playgrounds, the alcohol industry advertises NoLo products in these spaces using similar iconography and brand identifiers of parent brands. This article highlights evidence regarding the industry's roles in the frequent promotion of NoLo brands in Ireland, recommending areas for future research. While NoLo products and advertisements are becoming common in Ireland, recently, the alcohol industry invested \u20ac30 million to double NoLo's production capacity. Given the available evidence elsewhere, we argue that doubling the production capacity serves the alcohol industry's interests, not public health interests, as it misleadingly claims because it will increase alcogenic environments and exposure to more marketing campaigns and normalise alcohol consumption. We urge the Minister of Health to take responsibility for effectively interpreting and implementing the Public Health Act to ban NoLo advertising in spaces where full-strength beverage advertisements are prohibited. We conclude by recommending key areas for urgent research focusing on, but not limited to, the perceptions and consumption of NoLo among different populations, including those who drink harmfully or are in recovery and the impact of marketing and availability of NoLo on alcohol initiation and consumption among young people. This will help generate robust evidence to inform the public, improve public health, and implement policies that curtail alcohol corporations' health-damaging activities in Ireland.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the psychological mechanisms through which a removal of mentholated tobacco products from retail stores affects future smoking intentions among youth. Descriptive norms and injunctive norms were examined as candidate mediators. The study was conducted in the RAND StoreLab (RSL), a life-sized replica of a convenience store developed to evaluate how changing point-of-sale (POS) tobacco advertising influences tobacco use outcomes during simulated shopping experiences. Participants were assigned to shop randomly in the RSL under one of three experimental conditions that were (1) status quo condition in which all tobacco-, sweet-, and menthol-flavors were displayed; (2) tobacco/menthol condition in which only tobacco- and menthol-flavored tobacco products were displayed (sweet characterizing flavors other than tobacco or menthol/mint were removed from the display, effectively \"banned\"); and (3) tobacco-only condition in which only tobacco-flavored products were displayed (all sweet- and menthol-flavored products were removed). Results revealed that injunctive norms mediated the relationship between the removal of menthol cigarettes from the POS setting and increased intentions to smoke menthol-flavored cigarettes, whereas descriptive norms were not a significant mediator. These findings suggest that targeting injunctive smoking norms in public health communications may be a promising strategy to mitigate potential unintended consequences of a menthol ban on future smoking intentions for youth.",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy products (food, alcohol, tobacco) are among the main risk factors of non-communicable diseases. To discourage the consumption of these products, Iran has passed a law banning the advertisement of unhealthy products in all media and for all age groups. The purpose of the present study was to identify the challenges of this approach and provide evidence to facilitate the enforcement process and the participation of stakeholders. In this qualitative study participants were selected from the policymakers and experts involved in the banning of advertisements on unhealthy products in Iran. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 specialists and experts. The participants were selected through purposive and snowball sampling. Identified challenges and solutions were divided into three categories and nine themes: external (political, social, and economic); interorganizational (mission and communication); and internal (planning, organization, leadership, and control). Banning the advertisement of unhealthy products involves many challenges due to the existence of key players with different roles and missions. If these challenges are not managed effectively, they will hinder the enforcement and success of this law. Therefore, it is necessary for policymakers and health system managers to take the necessary measures to remove these obstacles.",

    "abstract": "Menthol cigarettes are disproportionately marketed and advertised in the commercial tobacco retail environment in Black communities across the United States, contributing to menthol cigarette-related disparities and lower likelihood of successful quitting among Black people who smoke. Policies restricting retail sales of menthol cigarettes are aimed at preventing initiation, promoting quitting, and reducing related disparities. Structured phone interview surveys were conducted from January to July 2021 with commercial tobacco retailers in Los Angeles County, California, unincorporated communities with a high percentage of Black residents, eight months after a local policy restricting retail sales of menthol cigarettes and other flavored nicotine and commercial tobacco products became effective on May 20, 2020. Interviews examined menthol cigarette sales restrictions-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Among 22 retailers interviewed, most (86.4%) reported having knowledge of the local ban on menthol cigarettes, and more than half (54.5%) reported offering price promotions for menthol cigarettes. Additionally, more than half (54.5%) reported believing customers who buy menthol cigarettes would stop smoking altogether following the ban. Most retailers reported having knowledge of the menthol ban, yet half reported offering price promotions for menthol cigarettes. Findings suggest retail availability of menthol cigarettes in Los Angeles County unincorporated communities with a high percentage of Black residents, post ban.

This study examined their perception, compliance, and potential economic impact of Nigeria's tobacco control laws related to the retail setting. This was a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews of 24 purposively selected tobacco vendors. The face-to-face interviews were aided by a semi-structured interview guide, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis with NVivo version 12. Five themes emerged, encompassing reasons for selling tobacco, awareness, perception, compliance with tobacco sales laws, the potential economic impact of the laws, and law enforcement activities. Vendors commenced tobacco sales due to consumers' demand, profit motives, and advice from close family relatives. They were unaware and non-compliant with most of the retail-related laws. Most participants had positive perceptions about the ban on sales to and by minors, were indifferent about the ban on Tobacco Advertising Promotion and Sponsorships (TAPS) and product display, and had negative perceptions about the ban on sales of single sticks. Most vendors stated quitting tobacco sales would not have a serious economic impact on their business. In conclusion, the vendors demonstrated limited awareness and non-compliance with various retail-oriented tobacco control laws in Nigeria. Addressing these gaps requires targeted educational campaigns and effective law enforcement strategies to enhance vendors' compliance.",

    "abstract": "In February 2022, Swiss citizens agreed to modify the Swiss Constitution to ban tobacco advertising reaching children and adolescents. This case study analyses the arguments used by both opponents and supporters of the constitutional amendment. Opponents argued that the proposed regulation went too far, threatened the economy, restricted personal freedom, was superfluous as the current law already protected youth and that it opened the door to marketing bans of other harmful products. Proponents focused on youth protection and invoked the burden of smoking on public health and the fact that advertising bans are an effective evidence-based measure. A comparison with previous campaigns to ban tobacco advertising that had failed suggests factors accounting for the positive vote in 2022. These include the strategic framing of youth protection, the separation of tobacco from other issues (such as alcohol advertising), the deteriorating image of the tobacco industry and the ability of the proponents to mobilise a broad coalition of health and youth organisations, with improved funding and communication. The lessons may be instructive for other campaigns seeking to regulate commercial determinants of health.",

    "title": "Alignment in local approaches to alcohol and cannabis control policy: A case study of California cities and counties.",
    "abstract": "Public health experts have urged governments around the world to regulate newly legalized cannabis as they do alcohol to effectively and efficiently protect health. However, research evaluating the alignment of alcohol and cannabis policies is sparse. We assessed similarities and differences in local alcohol and cannabis control policies across California, and characterized localities adopting distinct policy approaches. Using standard legal epidemiologic techniques, we collected and coded local alcohol and cannabis control policies relevant to public health for 12 California counties and all incorporated cities within them (N=241). We assessed whether localities were equally stringent on alcohol and cannabis policies by comparing overall restrictiveness (summed policy scores) and 9 specific provisions that applied to both substances. We captured distinct local alcohol-cannabis policy approaches using latent class analysis, and examined this classification in relation to local demographic, socioeconomic, political, and retail market characteristics. All 241 localities permitted alcohol sales, while 71% banned cannabis sales. Among those that did not ban cannabis sales, more stringent alcohol policy scores were associated with more stringent cannabis policy scores (linear regression coefficient: 0.16 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.25]). Local governments rarely adopted the same provisions for alcohol and cannabis (e.g., limits on hours of sale, advertising restrictions), and only two regulated the co-location of cannabis and alcohol outlets. Localities that were restrictive on alcohol yet permissive on cannabis (12%) were more urban, politically progressive, and had more low-income and racial/ethnic minority residents. Localities that were more permissive on alcohol and restrictive on cannabis (51%) were more socioeconomically advantaged. We found few similarities between local alcohol and cannabis control policies. California's experience suggests that, as governments around the world legalize cannabis, lessons learned from regulating alcohol are not routinely applied to cannabis, particularly in communities distinguished by high social and economic advantages.",

    "title": "Do alcohol control policies have the predicted effects on consumption? An analysis of the Baltic countries and Poland 2000-2020.",
    "abstract": "Many population-based alcohol control policies are postulated to work via changes in adult alcohol per capita consumption (APC). However, since APC is usually assessed on a yearly basis, often there are not enough data to conduct interrupted time-series or other controlled analyses. The current dataset, with 21 years of observation from four countries (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland), had sufficient power to test for average effects and potential interactions of the World Health Organization's (WHO) three \"best buys\" for alcohol control: taxation increases leading to a decrease in affordability; reduced availability (via a decrease in opening hours of at least 20 %); and advertising and marketing restrictions. We postulated that the former two would have immediate effects, while the latter would have mid- to long-term effects. Linear regression analysis. Taxation increases and availability reductions in all countries were associated with an average reduction in APC of 0.83\u00a0litres (\u2113) of pure alcohol per year (95 % confidence interval: -1.21 \u2113, -0.41 \u2113) in the same year, with no significant differences between countries.

    "abstract": "Alcohol use increases cancer risk, yet awareness of this association is low. Alcohol control policies have the potential to reduce alcohol-caused cancer morbidity and mortality. Research outside the U.S. has found awareness of the alcohol-cancer link to be associated with support for alcohol control policies. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of support for 3 communication-focused alcohol policies and examine how awareness of the alcohol-cancer link and drinking status are associated with policy support among U.S. residents. Investigators analyzed data from the 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey 5 Cycle 4. Analyses were performed in 2021. The proportion of Americans who supported banning outdoor alcohol advertising and adding warning labels and drinking guidelines to alcohol containers was estimated. Weighted multivariable logistic regression was used to examine how awareness of the alcohol-cancer link and drinking status were associated with policy support. Most Americans supported adding warning labels (65.1%) and drinking guidelines (63.9%), whereas only 34.4% supported banning outdoor alcohol advertising. Americans reporting that alcohol had no effect/decreased cancer risk had lower odds of support for advertising ban (OR=0.56), warning labels (OR=0.43), and guidelines (OR=0.46) than Americans aware of the alcohol-cancer link. Moreover, heavier drinkers had lower odds of support for advertising ban (OR=0.41), warning labels (OR=0.59), and guidelines (OR=0.60) than nondrinkers. Awareness of the alcohol-cancer link was associated with policy support. Increasing public awareness of the alcohol-cancer link may increase support for alcohol control policies.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory compliance in the retail environment is integral to the success of tobacco control. We assessed compliance among naswar (smokeless tobacco product widely used in South Asia) vendors with tobacco control laws. We also assessed their awareness of tobacco-related harms and policies and perceived effect of policies on their sales. We surveyed 286 naswar vendors in three districts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. We recruited general and specialty vendors from urban and rural areas through multistage cluster sampling. Compliance was measured for promotion, sale to/by minors and tax paid on naswar. We used logistic regression analyses for assessing the association between the outcome variables (awareness of tobacco harms and laws, perceptions about the effect of policies on business and compliance with laws) and their predictors. Most vendors (70%) were aware of tobacco-related harms of naswar. Although educated vendors were more aware of tobacco control policies, the greatest awareness was for a ban on sales to/by minors (21% overall). The majority of vendors (76%) violated this policy (measured by self-report), and violations were more common among rural than urban vendors (OR 2.27, 95%\u2009CI 1.05 to 4.96). Most vendors (71%) violated a ban on promotion of naswar. Vendors perceived tax increases and sales ban to/by minors as most detrimental for business. There was poor awareness and compliance among naswar vendors in Pakistan with tobacco control laws. This study finds potential areas for policy interventions that can reduce urban/rural disparities in implementation of and compliance with tobacco control laws.",

    "abstract": "The primary outcome desired for juvenile delinquency programs is the cessation of delinquent and related problematic behaviors. However, this outcome is almost always pursued by attempting to change intermediate outcomes, such as family functioning, improved mental health, or peer relations. We can conceptualize intermediate outcomes that are related to reduced delinquency as change levers for effective intervention. A large meta\u2010analysis identified several school\u2010related change levers, including school engagement (i.e., improved attendance and reduced truancy), nondelinquent problem behaviors, and attitudes about school and teachers. In addition, family functioning and reducing substance use were also effective change levers. In contrast, effects on youth getting/keeping a job, peer relationships, and academic achievement were not associated with reduced delinquency.Only a small percentage of rehabilitative programs provided to youth involved in the juvenile justice system have been established as evidence based. Moreover, there are constraints on what local policy makers and practitioners can do regarding the selection, adoption, and implementation of programs from the available lists of evidence\u2010based programs. Adopting programs that focus on effective change levers and avoiding those that concentrate on ineffective ones has the potential to increase the likelihood that a local agency is engaged in effective programming. Based on our data, programs known to improve family functioning, attachment to and involvement in schooling, and reducing substance use are justified by the change lever evidence, even if these programs\u2019 effectiveness in reducing delinquency has not been directly proven. In contrast, programs focusing on vocational skills, academic achievement, and peer relations are less likely to be beneficial. Furthermore, a change lever perspective can help frontline staff select appropriate programs for different juvenile offenders and focus their quality control efforts on those aspects of a program that are likely to be essential to maintaining effectiveness.",

    "title": "Effects of nutritional intervention strategies in the primary prevention of overweight and obesity in school settings: systematic review and network meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Objective To examine the effects of different nutritional intervention strategies in the school setting on anthropometric and quality of diet outcomes by comparing and ranking outcomes in a network meta-analysis. Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC), PsycInfo, CAB Abstracts, Campbell Library, Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre) BiblioMap, Australian Education Index, Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence-Based Practice (JBI EBP) database, Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition (PEN) database, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies A systematic literature search was performed from inception to 2 May 2022. Cluster randomised controlled trials meeting these study criteria were included: generally healthy school students aged 4-18 years; intervention with \u22651 nutritional components in a school setting; and studies that assessed anthropometric measures (eg, body mass index, body fat) or measures related to the quality of diet (eg, intake of fruit and vegetables), or both. Random effects pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses were performed with a frequentist approach. P scores, a frequentist analogue to surface under the cumulative ranking curve, ranging from 0 to 1 (indicating worst and best ranked interventions, respectively) were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed with Cochrane\u2019s RoB 2 tool. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to rate the certainty of evidence. Results 51 cluster randomised controlled trials involving 75\u2009954 participants and seven intervention nodes were included. Inconsistency could not be assessed (except for intake of fruit and vegetables) because the network meta-analyses were based mainly on star shaped networks with no direct evidence for specific pairs of nutritional interventions. Overall, little or no evidence was found to support a difference in body mass index, body weight, body fat, or waist circumference and moderate improvements in intake of fruit and vegetables with nutritional interventions in a school setting. Low to moderate certainty of evidence further suggested that multicomponent nutritional interventions likely reduced the prevalence (odds ratio 0.66, 95%\u2009confidence interval 0.55 to 0.80) and incidence (0.67, 0.47 to 0.96) of overweight compared with a control group. Based on low certainty of evidence, nutrition education and multicomponent interventions may be more effective than a control group (ie, usual practice) for increasing intake of fruit and vegetables. Multicomponent nutritional interventions were ranked the most effective for reducing body mass index (P score 0.76) and intake of fat (0.82). Nutrition education was ranked as best for body mass index z score (0.99), intake of fruit and vegetables (0.82), intake of fruit (0.92), and intake of vegetables (0.88). Conclusions The findings suggest that nutritional interventions in school settings may improve anthropometric and quality of diet measures, potentially contributing to the prevention of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence. The findings should be interpreted with caution because the certainty of evidence was often rated as low. The results of the network meta-analysis could be used by policy makers in developing and implementing effective, evidence based nutritional intervention strategies in the school setting.

    "abstract": "Nutrition labeling interventions are designed to provide consumers with easily interpretable nutritional information at the point of purchase. Despite the widespread implementation of these interventions and numerous research studies, there is little consensus as to their effect on consumer behavior. To address this issue, a novel methodology of second-order meta-analysis was utilized to provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior research on nutrition labeling effects. The difference in effects across published first-order meta-analyses was investigated based on whether the aim of the intervention was to prevent the consumption of unhealthy food or promote the consumption of healthy food (prevention vs. promotion focus). The extent to which the aim of the intervention impacts other intervention and study characteristics in study outcomes was additionally examined. Analysis of 93 first-order meta-analysis effect sizes highlighted differences according to whether the aim of the intervention was to prevent the consumption of unhealthy food or promote the consumption of healthy food. Differences were identified in the size of nutrition label effects for various label types, label location, and study and sample characteristics. In addition to important public policy implications, this research contributes to the ongoing discussion on the merits and limitations of meta-analysis methodology.",

    "abstract": "Background There are well documented socioeconomic disparities in diet quality and obesity. Menu energy labelling is a public health policy designed to improve diet and reduce obesity. However, it is unclear whether the impact energy labelling has on consumer behaviour is socially equitable or differs based on socioeconomic position (SEP). Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental (between-subjects) and pre-post implementation field studies examining the impact of menu energy labelling on energy content of food and/or drink selections in higher vs. lower SEP groups. Results Seventeen studies were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses of 13 experimental studies that predominantly examined hypothetical food and drink choices showed that energy labelling tended to be associated with a small reduction in energy content of selections that did not differ based on participant SEP (X 2 (1)\u2009=\u20090.26, p \u2009=\u2009.610). Effect estimates for higher SEP SMD\u2009=\u20090.067 [95% CI: -0.092 to 0.226] and lower SEP SMD\u2009=\u20090.115 [95% CI: -0.006 to 0.237] were similar. A meta-analysis of 3 pre-post implementation studies of energy labelling in the real world showed that the effect energy labelling had on consumer behaviour did not significantly differ based on SEP (X 2 (1)\u2009=\u20090.22, p \u2009=\u2009.636). In higher SEP the effect was SMD\u2009=\u20090.032 [95% CI: -0.053 to 0.117] and in lower SEP the effect was SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.005 [95% CI: -0.051 to 0.041]. Conclusions Overall there was no convincing evidence that the effect energy labelling has on consumer behaviour significantly differs based on SEP. Further research examining multiple indicators of SEP and quantifying the long-term effects of energy labelling on consumer behaviour in real-world settings is now required.

    "abstract": "Background: Addictive disorders are significant global public health burdens. Treatment uptake with these disorders is low and outcomes can be mixed. Electronic screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (e-SBIRT) programs have potential to improve uptake and treatment outcomes. To date, however, no prior review of the literature has been conducted to gauge the effectiveness of e-SBIRT for addictive disorders. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature concerning e-SBIRT for addictive disorders by surveying the MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and PsycInfo databases on January 17, 2023. Results: Ten articles were included at analysis reporting evaluation of e-SBIRT interventions for substance use disorders including alcohol use in a variety of settings. No articles were identified regarding treatment for behavioral addictions such as disordered/harmful gambling. Meta-analysis found e-SBIRT to be effective at reducing drinking frequency in the short term only. e-SBIRT was not found to be advantageous over control conditions for abstinence or other treatment outcomes. We identified and described common components of e-SBIRT programs and assessed the quality of available evidence, which was generally poor. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that research regarding e-SBIRT is concentrated exclusively on higher-risk substance use. There is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of e-SBIRT for addictive disorders. Although common features exist, e-SBIRT designs are variable, which complicates identification of the most effective components. Overall, the quality of outcome evidence is low, and furthermore, high-quality experimental treatment evaluation research is needed.",

    "abstract": "Background Attention is essential to daily life and cognitive functioning, and attention deficits can affect daily functional and social behaviour, such as falls, risky driving, and accidental injuries. However, attention function is important yet easily overlooked in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, and evidence is limited. We aimed to explore the pooled effect of cognitive training on domains of attention in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia using a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) up to 3 November 2022. We included participants aged \u226550 years diagnosed with cognitive impairment, with various cognitive training interventions as the intervention measures. The primary outcome was overall attention and the secondary outcomes were attention in different domains and global cognitive function. We calculated the Hedges\u2019 g and confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model to evaluate the effect size of the outcome measures and evaluated heterogeneity using the \u03c72 test and I2 value. Results We included 17 RCTs and found that cognitive training interventions improve overall attention (Hedges\u2019 g\u2009=\u20090.41; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.13, 0.70), selective attention (Hedges\u2019 g\u2009=\u20090.37; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.19, 0.55), divided attention (Hedges\u2019 g\u2009=\u20090.38; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.03, 0.72), and global cognitive function (Hedges\u2019 g\u2009=\u20090.30; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.58) in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, but with relatively low effectiveness. Conclusions Cognitive training intervention can improve some attention functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Attention function training should also be incorporated into routine activities and long-term sustainability planning to delay the deterioration of attention function in older adults. Besides reducing their risk of abnormal events in daily life (such as falls), it can also improve their quality of life and help reduce the progression of cognitive impairment, achieving early detection of secondary prevention.

    "abstract": "Psychotherapies are first\u2010line treatments for most mental disorders, but their absolute outcomes (i.e., response and remission rates) are not well studied, despite the relevance of such information for health care users, providers and policy makers. We aimed to examine absolute and relative outcomes of psychotherapies across eight mental disorders: major depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), specific phobia, post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive\u2010compulsive disorder (OCD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD). We used a series of living systematic reviews included in the Metapsy initiative (www.metapsy.org), with a common strategy for literature search, inclusion of studies and extraction of data, and a common format for the analyses. Literature search was conducted in major bibliographical databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials) up to January 1, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials comparing psychotherapies for any of the eight mental disorders, established by a diagnostic interview, with a control group (waitlist, care\u2010as\u2010usual, or pill placebo). We conducted random\u2010effects model pairwise meta\u2010analyses. The main outcome was the absolute rate of response (at least 50% symptom reduction between baseline and post\u2010test) in the treatment and control conditions. Secondary outcomes included the relative risk (RR) of response, and the number needed to treat (NNT). Random\u2010effects meta\u2010analyses of the included 441 trials (33,881 patients) indicated modest response rates for psychotherapies: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.39\u20100.45) for MDD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33\u20100.43) for PTSD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.30\u20100.47) for OCD; 0.38 (95% CI: 0.33\u20100.43) for panic disorder; 0.36 (95% CI: 0.30\u20100.42) for GAD; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.29\u20100.37) for social anxiety disorder; 0.32 (95% CI: 0.23\u20100.42) for specific phobia; and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.15\u20100.36) for BPD. Most sensitivity analyses broadly supported these findings. The RRs were significant for all disorders, except BPD. Our conclusion is that most psychotherapies for the eight mental disorders are effective compared with control conditions, but absolute response rates are modest. More effective treatments and interventions for those not responding to a first\u2010line treatment are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background Chronic disease management (CDM) through sustained knowledge translation (KT) interventions ensures long-term, high-quality care. We assessed implementation of KT interventions for supporting CDM and their efficacy when sustained in older adults. Methods Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis engaging 17 knowledge users using integrated KT. Eligibility criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including adults (>\u200965\u00a0years old) with chronic disease(s), their caregivers, health and/or policy-decision makers receiving a KT intervention to carry out a CDM intervention for at least 12\u00a0months (versus other KT interventions or usual care). Information sources: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from each database\u2019s inception to March 2020. Outcome measures: Sustainability, fidelity, adherence of KT interventions for CDM practice, quality of life (QOL) and quality of care (QOC). Data extraction, risk of bias (ROB) assessment: We screened, abstracted and appraised articles (Effective Practice and Organisation of Care ROB tool) independently and\u00a0in duplicate. Data synthesis: We performed both random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses and estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous data. Results We included 158 RCTs (973,074 participants [961,745 patients, 5540 caregivers, 5789 providers]) and 39 companion reports comprising 329 KT interventions, involving patients (43.2%), healthcare providers (20.7%) or both (10.9%). We identified 16 studies described as assessing sustainability in 8.1% interventions, 67 studies as assessing adherence in 35.6% interventions and 20 studies as assessing fidelity in 8.7% of the interventions.

    "title": "Do Brief Alcohol Interventions Reduce Driving After Drinking Among College Students? A Two-step Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data",
    "abstract": "Abstract Aims College students who drink are at an increased risk of driving after drinking and alcohol-involved traffic accidents and deaths. Furthermore, the persistence of driving after drinking over time underscores a need for effective interventions to prevent future drunk driving in adulthood. The present study examined whether brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) for college students reduce driving after drinking. Methods A two-step meta-analysis of individual participant data (IPD) was conducted using a combined sample of 6801 college students from 15 randomized controlled trials (38% male, 72% White and 58% first-year students). BAIs included individually delivered Motivational Interviewing with Personalized Feedback (MI + PF), Group Motivational Interviewing (GMI), and stand-alone Personalized Feedback (PF) interventions. Two outcome variables, driving after two+/three+ drinks and driving after four+/five+ drinks, were checked, harmonized and analyzed separately for each study and then combined for meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis. Results BAIs lowered the risk of driving after four+/five+ drinks (19% difference in the odds of driving after drinking favoring BAIs vs. control), but not the risk of driving after two+/three+ drinks (9% difference). Subsequent subgroup analysis indicated that the MI + PF intervention was comparatively better than PF or GMI. Conclusions BAIs provide a harm reduction approach to college drinking. Hence, it is encouraging that BAIs reduce the risk of driving after heavy drinking among college students. However, there may be opportunities to enhance the intervention content and timing to be more relevant for driving after drinking and improve the outcome assessment and reporting to demonstrate its effect.",

    "title": "Maternal caffeine consumption during pregnancy and offspring cord blood DNA methylation: an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": " Current guidelines recommend pregnant women to limit caffeine intake to less than 200\u00a0mg daily, even though there is no clear proof of its effects on human development. A biological explanation for how exposure to caffeine during pregnancy influences development would help clarify if recommended limits are justified. An epigenetic mechanism, called DNA methylation (DNAm), has been suggested as a potential biological explanation for how caffeine intake during pregnancy influences health development. DNAm can switch genes \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019 in response to environmental influences and therefore act as a bridge between genes and the environment. Studies have found that smoking during pregnancy is connected to over 6000 changes in DNAm at birth, with lasting effects into adulthood. To explore the link between caffeine intake during pregnancy and DNAm at birth, we analyzed data from 3725\u00a0mother\u2013child pairs living in different European countries. We looked at effects from coffee, tea and cola intake during pregnancy on children's DNAm at birth. We found one change in DNAm to be connected to total caffeine and another to cola consumption during pregnancy. These few connections do not provide convincing evidence that caffeine intake during pregnancy impacts children's DNAm at birth. However, because mothers in our study consumed little caffeine, it is possible that results would be different in studies with participants consuming high amounts of caffeine during pregnancy. Potentially, our study did not include enough people to find very small changes in DNAm that are connected to caffeine consumption during pregnancy.",

    "title": "Determining a dosage threshold of drink-driving enforcement operations: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Policy enforcement is crucial to achieve impacts on alcohol-related harm. It is not clear what level of enforcement intensity or 'dosage' is necessary for addressing drink driving and related harms. Given competing enforcement demands and agencies' resource constraints, understanding how much enforcement is sufficient to deter drink driving is critical. This systematic literature review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA) guidelines to examine research about dosage effects of enforcement and related visibility on drink-driving outcomes, including motor vehicle crashes and fatalities. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool and the JBI checklist. The 21 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review differed in measures of enforcement dosage and outcomes, making it difficult to synthesise results across studies and draw conclusions about a threshold or optimal level of enforcement. Although most included studies found that sustained enforcement was associated with reductions in drink driving or related harms, only two studies tested an optimal dosage. Due to study design limitations, a substantial percentage of these studies must be considered with caution. Additional research with rigorous study designs with appropriate controls is needed to determine an optimal high visibility enforcement dosage level to help law enforcement agencies make realistic decisions about allocating enforcement resources to address drink driving. Consistent evidence about a drink-driving enforcement dosage threshold is lacking, partly due to an insufficient number of well-designed studies. Addressing challenges of conducting rigorous studies in community settings is crucial.",

    "abstract": "Culpability studies, a common study design in the cannabis crash risk literature, typically report odds-ratios (OR) indicating the raised risks of a culpable accident. This parameter is of unclear policy relevance, and is frequently misinterpreted as an estimate of the increased crash risk, a practice that introduces a substantial \"interpretational bias\". A Bayesian statistical model for culpability study counts is developed to provide inference for both culpable and total crash risks, with a hierarchical effect specification to allow for meta-analysis across studies with potentially heterogeneous risk parameter values. The model is assessed in a bootstrap study and applied to data from 13 published culpability studies. The model outperforms the culpability OR in bootstrap analyses. Used on actual study data, the average increase in crash risk is estimated at 1.28 (1.16-1.40). The pooled increased risk of a culpable crash is estimated as 1.42 (95% credibility interval 1.11-1.75), which is similar to pooled estimates using traditional ORs (1.46, 95% CI: 1.24-1.72). The attributable risk fraction of cannabis impaired driving is estimated to lie below 2% for all but two of the included studies. Culpability ORs exaggerate risk increases and parameter uncertainty when misinterpreted as total crash ORs. The increased crash risk associated with THC-positive drivers in culpability studies is low.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use and misuse in young people is a major risk behaviour for mortality and morbidity. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a popular technique for addressing excessive drinking in young adults. To assess the effects of motivational interviewing (MI) interventions for preventing alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems in young adults. We identified relevant evidence from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1988 to July 2015), and PsycINFO (1985 to July 2015). We also searched clinical trial registers and handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and the included studies. We included randomised controlled trials in young adults up to the age of 25 years comparing MIs for prevention of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems with no intervention, assessment only or alternative interventions for preventing alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included a total of 84 trials (22,872 participants), with 70/84 studies reporting interventions in higher risk individuals or settings. Studies with follow-up periods of at least four months were of more interest in assessing the sustainability of intervention effects and were also less susceptible to short-term reporting or publication bias. Overall, the risk of bias assessment showed that these studies provided moderate or low quality evidence.At four or more months follow-up, we found effects in favour of MI for the quantity of alcohol consumed (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to -0.06 or a reduction from 13.7 drinks/week to 12.5 drinks/week; moderate quality evidence); frequency of alcohol consumption (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.07 or a reduction in the number of days/week alcohol was consumed from 2.74 days to 2.52 days; moderate quality evidence); and peak blood alcohol concentration, or BAC (SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.05, or a reduction from 0.144% to 0.131%; moderate quality evidence).We found a marginal effect in favour of MI for alcohol problems (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.00 or a reduction in an alcohol problems scale score from 8.91 to 8.18; low quality evidence) and no effects for binge drinking (SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.02, moderate quality evidence) or for average BAC (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.08; moderate quality evidence). We also considered other alcohol-related behavioural outcomes, and at four or more months follow-up, we found no effects on drink-driving (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.10; moderate quality of evidence) or other alcohol-related risky behaviour (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.01; moderate quality evidence).Further analyses showed that there was no clear relationship between the duration of the MI intervention (in minutes) and effect size. Subgroup analyses revealed no clear subgroup effects for longer-term outcomes (four or more months) for assessment only versus alternative intervention controls; for university/college vs other settings; or for higher risk vs all/low risk participants.None of the studies reported harms related to MI. The results of this review indicate that there are no substantive, meaningful benefits of MI interventions for preventing alcohol use, misuse or alcohol-related problems. Although we found some statistically significant effects, the effect sizes were too small, given the measurement scales used in the included studies, to be of relevance to policy or practice. Moreover, the statistically significant effects are not consistent for all misuse measures, and the quality of evidence is not strong, implying that any effects could be inflated by risk of bias.",

We conducted a systematic review to describe the legal consequences for alcohol-impaired drivers injured in a MVC and taken to a hospital or trauma center. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases from inception until August 2014. We included studies that reported legal consequences including charges or convictions of injured drivers taken to a hospital or trauma center after a MVC with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) exceeding the legal limit.Results Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria; twenty studies were conducted in the USA, five in Canada, and one in Sweden. All were cohort studies (23 retrospective, 3 prospective) and included 11,409 patients overall. A total of 5,127 drivers had a BAC exceeding the legal limit, with legal consequences reported in 4937 cases. The median overall DUI/DWI conviction rate was 13% (range 0-85%). The median percentage of drivers with a previous conviction on their record for driving under the influence (DUI) or driving while intoxicated (DWI) was 15.5% (range 6-40%).

In contrast, general population alcohol policies are protective for the general population. Here, we assessed whether US state-level general population alcohol policies are related to drinking outcomes among women of reproductive age.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted secondary analyses of 1984-2020 National Alcohol Survey data (N\u2009=\u200913,555 women \u226444\u2009years old). State-level policy exposures were government control of liquor retail sales, heavy beer at gas stations, heavy beer at grocery stores, liquor at grocery stores, Sunday off-premise liquor sales, and blood alcohol concentration (BAC) driving limits (no law, 0.10 limit, 0.05-0.08 limit). Outcomes were past 12-month number of drinks, \u22655 drink days, \u22658 drink days, and any DSM-IV alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. Regressions adjusted for individual and state-level controls, clustering by state, and included fixed effects for survey month and year.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAllowing Sunday off-premise liquor sales versus not was related to having 1.20 times as many drinks (95% CI: 1.01, 1.42), 1.41 times as many \u22655 drink days (95% CI: 1.08, 1.85), and 1.91 times as many \u22658 drink days (95% CI: 1.28, 2.83).

    "title": "Can a policy-induced reduction in alcohol consumption improve health outcomes and stimulate the UK economy?: A potential 'double dividend'.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND AIMS\nThe health benefits of reducing excessive alcohol consumption are well-documented and widely accepted, but policies directed to this end are often regarded as damaging to the economy. Previous UK alcohol impact studies typically focus on what are in effect the 'gross' impacts of a fall in alcohol consumption considered in isolation, so that estimated economic impacts are always negative. Here we investigate the 'net' impacts of a reduction in consumption accounting for the reallocation of household spending and the expenditure of any increase in government revenues.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nWe employ a health-augmented, Input-Output modelling framework. We simulate the impact of a reduction in alcohol consumption due to: a change in consumer tastes that generate a reallocation of household spending; an increase in alcohol duties accompanied by the use of increased revenues to stimulate government expenditure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe find evidence of a trade-off between employment and health benefits for the case of a tastes-induced switch from alcohol consumption, but this is less severe than past analyses would suggest (and does not apply to economic activity more generally). For the case of increased taxation on alcohol (and increased government spending) we find that there is in fact no trade-off between employment on the one hand and health on the other; employment and economic activity are stimulated while health outcomes improve.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThere is a potential 'double-dividend' of improved health outcomes and increased economic activity as a consequence of a rise in alcohol duties.",

In this review, we aimed to describe the current landscape of available epidemiological evidence on key climate risks on maternal and newborn health (MNH). Methods We sought to identify published systematic and scoping reviews investigating the impact of different climate hazards and air pollution on MNH outcomes. With this in mind, we developed a systematic search strategy based on the concepts of \u2018climate/air pollution hazards, \u2018maternal health,\u2019 and \u2018newborn health,\u2019 with restrictions to reviews published between 1 January 2010 and 6 February 2023, but without geographical or language restriction. Following full text screening and data extraction, we synthesised the results using narrative synthesis. Results We found 79 reviews investigating the effects of climate hazards on MNH, mainly focussing on outdoor air pollution (n\u2009=\u200947, 59%), heat (n\u2009=\u200924, 30%), and flood/storm disasters (n\u2009=\u20097, 9%). Most were published after 2015 (n\u2009=\u200960, 76%). These reviews had consistent findings regarding the positive association of exposure to heat and to air pollution with adverse birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. We found limited evidence for impacts of climate-related food and water security on MNH and did not identify any reviews on climate-sensitive infectious diseases and MNH. Conclusions Climate change could undermine recent improvements in maternal and newborn health. Our review provides an overview of key climate risks to MNH. It could therefore be useful to the MNH community to better understand the MNH needs for each climate hazard and to strengthen discussions on evidence and research gaps and potential actions. Despite the lack of comprehensive evidence for some climate hazards and for many maternal, perinatal, and newborn outcomes, we observed repeated findings of the impact of heat and air pollutants on birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth. It is time for policy dialogue to follow to specifically design climate policy and actions to protect the needs of MNH.",

    "title": "Impact of climate change on maternal health outcomes: An evidence gap map review",
    "abstract": "Climate change poses unique challenges to maternal well-being and increases complications during pregnancy and childbirth globally. This evidence gap map (EGM) aims to identify gaps in existing knowledge and areas where further research related to climate change and its impact on maternal health is required. The following databases were searched individually from inception to present: Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health via OVID; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) via EBSCOhost; Scopus; and organizational websites. In this EGM, we integrated 133 studies published in English, including qualitative, quantitative, reviews and grey literature that examined the impact of climate change on maternal health (women aged 15\u201345). We used Covidence to screen studies and Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (Eppi reviewer)/Eppi Mapper software to generate the EGM. Data extraction and qualitative appraisal of the studies was done using critical appraisal tools. The study protocol was registered in International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) # INPLASY202370085. Out of 133 included studies, forty seven studies were of high quality, seventy nine moderate equality and seven low quality. This EGM found notable gaps in the literature regarding the distribution of research across regions. We found significant research in North America (51) and Asia (40 studies). However, Africa and the Caribbean had fewer studies, highlighting potential disparities in research attention and resources. Moreover, while the impact of extreme heat emerged as a prominent factor impacting maternal well-being, there is a need for further investigation into other climate-related factors such as drought. Additionally, while preterm stillbirth and maternal mortality have gained attention, there is an overlook of malnutrition and food insecurity indicators that require attention in future research. The EGM identifies existing research gaps in climate change and maternal health. It emphasizes the need for global collaboration and targeted interventions to address disparities and inform climate-responsive policies.",

    "title": "Does persistent precarious employment affect health outcomes among working age adults? A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the impact of persistent precarious employment (lasting 12+ months) on the health of working age adults, compared with more stable employment. Persistent precarity reflects a shift towards less secure forms of employment and may be particularly important for health. Methods Nine databases were systematically searched to identify quantitative studies that assessed the relationship between persistent precarious employment and health outcomes. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using an adaptation of the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool. Narrative synthesis and random effects meta-analysis were conducted. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results Of 12 940 records screened, 50 studies met the inclusion criteria and 29 were included in meta-analyses. RoB was generally high (n=18). The most reported outcome domain was mental health; with evidence also reported relating to general health, physical health,and health behaviours. Of GRADE assessed outcomes, persistent precarious employment was associated with increased risk of poor self-rated health (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.14, I2=80%) and mental health symptoms (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.70, I2=65%). The association with all-cause mortality was imprecisely estimated (OR 1.10, 5% CI 0.91 to 1.33, I2=73%). There was very low GRADE certainty across all outcomes. Conclusions Persistent precarious employment is associated with poorer health, particularly for outcomes with short time lags, though associations are small and causality is highly uncertain. Further research using more robust methods is needed but given potential health harms of persistent precarious employment, exploration of precautionary labour regulations and employment policies is warranted.",

    "title": "Childhood Socioeconomic Status and Late-Adulthood Health Outcomes in China: A Life-Course Perspective",
    "abstract": "The relationship between socioeconomic status and health has been studied widely across many western countries but the relationship is relatively underexplored in China. Using a life-course perspective, this paper examines the associations between six indicators of childhood socioeconomic status with classic late-adulthood health outcomes. The analysis uses logistic and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression models with data on life history and data from the most recent wave of CHARLS \u2013 a nationally representative survey of people aged 45 and older. The models demonstrate that unfavourable socioeconomic status in childhood is, in general, correlated with poorer health outcomes later in life, whereas a more socioeconomically advantaged childhood is associated with better health outcomes in middle and older age. However, for those individuals who were overweight in childhood, the advantaged socioeconomic status effect appears to increase the probability of remaining overweight when older. Furthermore, the indicators of current socioeconomic status as well as the interaction terms between childhood socioeconomic status and adulthood socioeconomic status were introduced, as most existing research in the world, including China, tends to only focus on the mediation effect of current socioeconomic status. The findings show that, among all the health outcomes in this research, only the associations between disability-related health variables and adulthood socioeconomic status are moderated by childhood socioeconomic status. These results indicate both homogeneity and heterogeneity in the impacts of childhood socioeconomic status on different health outcomes and also inform public policies in China with regard to population health.",

    "abstract": "Introduction With the recent emergence of the Healthy People 2030 goals there is a need to understand the role of SDOH on health inequalities from an upstream perspective. This review summarizes the recent body of evidence on the impact of SDOH across adolescence and youth health outcomes by race/ethnicity using the Health People 2030 Framework. Methods A systematic, reproducible search was performed using PubMed, Academic Search Premier, PsychInfo, and ERIC. A total of 2078 articles were screened for inclusion. A total of 263 articles met inclusion criteria, resulting in 29 articles included for final synthesis. Results Across the 29 articles, 11 were cross-sectional, 16 were cohort, and 2 were experimental. Across SDOH categories (economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context), 1 study examined self-efficacy, 6 educational attainment, 10 behavior, 5 smoking, 11 alcohol use, 10 substance use, and 1 quality of life. The majority of outcomes represented in this search included health behaviors such as health risk behavior, smoking, alcohol use, and substance use. Across the 29 articles identified, significant differences existed across outcomes by race/ethnicity across SDOH factors, however magnitude of differences varied by SDOH category. Discussion SDOH differentially affect adolescents and youth across race/ethnicity. The lived adverse\u00a0experiences, along with structural racism, increase the likelihood of adolescents and youth engaging in risky health behaviors and negatively influencing health outcomes during adolescence and youth. Research, public health initiatives, and policies integrating SDOH into interventions at early stage of life are needed to effectively reduce social and health inequalities at a population level.",

    "title": "The impact of an integrated alcohol policy: The example of Lithuania",
    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Although integrated alcohol policies, characterised by being consistent, structurally connected and interdependent, are considered to be best practices, very few evaluations of such policies exist. We evaluated the impact of two phases of integrated alcohol policies implemented in Lithuania in 2008/2009 and 2017/2018 on adult (15+ years of age) alcohol per capita consumption. Methods Alcohol per capita consumption was the main outcome, based on national data from Statistics Lithuania. Time\u2010series analyses using generalised additive mixed models were used, and unrecorded consumption trends were examined. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with data from the World Health Organization. Results The two phases of integrated alcohol policies were associated with average reductions in adult alcohol per capita consumption of almost 1 litre (\u22120.88\u2009L; 95% confidence interval \u22121.43; \u22120.34). Sensitivity analyses with comparable international data on Lithuania yielded similar results. Discussion and Conclusions Integrated alcohol policies had a substantial effect on the average level of consumption. However, the effect of major single policies for Lithuania and other Baltic countries has been estimated to be of about the same magnitude. We conclude that in order to be successful, integrated alcohol policies should include at least one major effective population\u2010based policy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Our descriptive study examined current associations (2022\u20132024) between US state-level health outcomes and 4 US state-level political metrics: 2 rarely used in public health research (political ideology of elected representatives based on voting records; trifectas, where 1 party controls the executive and legislative branches) and 2 more commonly used (state policies enacted; voter political lean). The 8 health outcomes spanned the life course: infant mortality, premature mortality (death at age <65), health insurance (adults aged 35\u201364), vaccination for children and persons aged \u226565 (flu; COVID-19 booster), maternity care deserts, and food insecurity. For the first 3 outcomes, we also examined trends in associations (2012\u20132024). For all political metrics, higher state-level political conservatism was associated with worse health outcomes, especially for the metrics for political ideology and state trifectas. For example, in 2016, the premature mortality rate in states with Republican vs Democratic trifectas was higher by 55.4 deaths per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 7.7, 103.1), and the slope of the rate of increase to 2021 was also higher, by 27.0 deaths per 100 000 person-years (95% CI: 24.4, 29.7). These results suggest elections, political ideology, and concentrations of political power matter for population health.",

    "abstract": "This population-based study aims to explore the effect of the integration of the Urban and Rural Residents' Basic Medical Insurance (URRBMI) policy on the health outcomes of the middle-aged and elderly. A total of 13,360 participants in 2011 and 15,082 participants in 2018 were drawn from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Health outcomes were evaluated using the prevalence of chronic diseases. A generalized linear mixed model was used to analyze the effect of the URRBMI policy on the prevalence of chronic disease. Prior to the introduction of the URRBMI policy, 67.09% of the rural participants and 73.00% of the urban participants had chronic diseases; after the policy's implementation, 43.66% of the rural participants and 45.48% of the urban participants had chronic diseases. When adjusting for the confounding factors, the generalized linear mixed model showed that the risk of having a chronic disease decreased by 81% [odds ratio (OR) = 0.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.23] after the introduction of the policy in the urban participants; in the rural participants, the risk of having a chronic disease was 30% lower (OR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.82) than the risk in the urban participants before the policy and 84% lower (OR = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.19) after the implementation of the policy; the differences in the ORs decreased from 0.30 prior to the policy to 0.03 after the policy had been introduced between rural and urban participants when adjusting for the influence of socioeconomic factors on chronic diseases. This study provides evidence of the positive effects of the URRBMI policy on improving the rural population's health outcomes and reducing the gap in health outcomes between rural and urban populations, indicating that the implementation of the URRBMI policy has promoted the coverage of universal health.",

Sexual consequence mediators included sexually transmitted infection, adolescent pregnancy, and a high number of sexual partners. We used linear logistic regression to model main effect and mediated associations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAge of sexual initiation was related to nicotine and marijuana disorders, physical health, and obesity, but not alcohol disorder or depression. Mediated association with nicotine disorder was not significant; association with marijuana disorder was reduced; significant relationships with poor health and obesity remained.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe relationship between age of sexual initiation and substance use was largely explained by consequences of sexual behavior. Earlier sexual initiation was linked to poorer physical health outcomes, though the nature of the association remains unclear. Public Health Implications. Prevention approaches need to address multiple risk factors and emphasize contraceptive methods to avoid sexual consequences. For physical health outcomes, broad prevention approaches, including addressing early sexual initiation, may be effective.",

    "abstract": "Many European countries have raised the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) from 16 to 18 over the past decades. These policies often comprise a bundle of reforms including restrictions on alcohol sales to minors, venue access limitations, and advertising controls. We provide novel evidence of the impact of MLDA changes on educational outcomes by exploiting their staggered timing across Spanish regions. Alcohol consumption among adolescents aged 14-17 decreased by 7 to 17% and exam performance improved by 4% of a standard deviation. We also observe a 10% decrease in the use of anxiolytics and hypnosedatives, suggesting improved mental health. There are no significant changes in the use of other substances, leisure habits or study effort. These findings are consistent with neurobiological evidence that alcohol directly impairs cognitive development and increases anxiety-related behaviours. Reducing teenage alcohol consumption represents a substantial opportunity to improve educational outcomes in Europe, where youth drinking rates remain notably high.",

    "abstract": "Persons with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, ~\u200938.1\u00a0million Americans) are at risk of poor health, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) if their disease is poorly controlled. T2DM control requires disease self-management through adequate physical activity and optimum diet. We evaluated the physical activity and diet patterns of the US T2DM population against the American Diabetes Association and clinical practice guideline norms, and their associations with health outcomes. Using a cross-sectional, observational study design, we studied the US T2DM population's physical activity and fruit/vegetable intake (independent variables), and their associations with three health outcomes, self-rated health (from the SF-36 question on experienced health status, categorized as excellent/very good/good vs. fair/poor), CVD-free status, and CKD-free status. We used pooled data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Surveys (2015, 2017 and 2019) on adults aged 30-75 years with T2DM (defined as diabetes mellitus diagnosed after age 30). Physical activity categories were inactive, insufficiently active, sufficiently active, highly active, and fruit/vegetable intake categories, \u2264\u20092, 3-4, and \u2265\u20095 daily servings. We used hierarchical logistic regression, adjusting for demographic variables (age, sex, race), and potentially confounding factors, diabetes severity (disease duration, insulin use), chronic comorbidity, overweight/obese, smoking, alcohol overuse, having a regular healthcare provider, and having health insurance. Missing data were coded as a separate category. We conducted a subgroup analysis of those with \u2265\u200910 years of disease duration. Among 119,298 respondents with T2DM (52.1% female, mean age 62.1 years, 94% insured), 36.9% were physically inactive and 16.2% insufficiently active, 52.6% consumed\u2009\u2264\u20092 daily servings of fruit/vegetables, 57% reported excellent-good health, 24.7% had CVD, and 9.7% had CKD. Physical activity showed a dose-dependent association with self-rated health (reference group, physically inactive; adjusted OR for insufficiently active 1.77 (95%CI 1.71-1.83), sufficiently active, 2.33 (2.24-2.43), highly active, 2.63 (2.54-2.72)), as did fruit/vegetable intake [reference group\u2009\u2264\u20092 daily servings; OR for 3-4 servings, 1.12 (1.09-1.16), and \u2265\u20095 servings, 1.13 (1.08-1.17)]. Physical activity was associated with being CKD-free (ORs, 1.29 (1.22-1.37), 1.50 (1.40-1.60), 1.52 (1.44-1.60, respectively), and being CVD-free (1.31 (1.25-1.37), 1.34 (1.28-1.41, and 1.37(1.31-1.42), respectively). Fruit/vegetable intake was not associated with CVD. CKD outcome was not studied due to dietary restrictions of CKD patients. Subgroup analyses (53,925 respondents) showed similar results. Over a third of the US T2DM population and the subgroup with long-term T2DM were physically inactive, a sixth were insufficiently active, and over half had negligible fruit/vegetable intake. On the positive side, even limited physical activity and fruit-vegetable intake were associated with substantial health benefits including subjective quality of life (self-rated health) compared to physically inactive/negligible fruit-vegetable intake. Our findings call for disease self-management research focused on physician communication for patient empowerment to enable incremental improvements, however modest.",

    "title": "Global burden of 292 causes of death in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.",
    "abstract": "Timely and comprehensive analyses of causes of death stratified by age, sex, and location are essential for shaping effective health policies aimed at reducing global mortality. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 provides cause-specific mortality estimates measured in counts, rates, and years of life lost (YLLs). GBD 2023 aimed to enhance our understanding of the relationship between age and cause of death by quantifying the probability of dying before age 70 years (70q0) and the mean age at death by cause and sex. This study enables comparisons of the impact of causes of death over time, offering a deeper understanding of how these causes affect global populations. GBD 2023 produced estimates for 292 causes of death disaggregated by age-sex-location-year in 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations for each year from 1990 until 2023. We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure. As part of the modelling process, uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated using the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles from a 250-draw distribution for each metric. Findings are reported as counts and age-standardised rates. Methodological improvements for cause-of-death estimates in GBD 2023 include a correction for the misclassification of deaths due to COVID-19, updates to the method used to estimate COVID-19, and updates to the CODEm modelling framework. This analysis used 55\u2008761 data sources, including vital registration and verbal autopsy data as well as data from surveys, censuses, surveillance systems, and cancer registries, among others. For GBD 2023, there were 312 new country-years of vital registration cause-of-death data, 3 country-years of surveillance data, 51 country-years of verbal autopsy data, and 144 country-years of other data types that were added to those used in previous GBD rounds. The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic caused shifts in long-standing rankings of the leading causes of global deaths: it ranked as the number one age-standardised cause of death at Level 3 of the GBD cause classification hierarchy in 2021. By 2023, COVID-19 dropped to the 20th place among the leading global causes, returning the rankings of the leading two causes to those typical across the time series (ie, ischaemic heart disease and stroke). While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause. Compared to 1990, there has been a considerable reduction in total YLLs in many vaccine-preventable diseases, most notably diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and measles. In addition, this study quantified the mean age at death for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality and found noticeable variation by sex and location. The global all-cause mean age at death increased from 46\u00b78 years (95% UI 46\u00b76-47\u00b70) in 1990 to 63\u00b74 years (63\u00b71-63\u00b77) in 2023. For males, mean age increased from 45\u00b74 years (45\u00b71-45\u00b77) to 61\u00b72 years (60\u00b77-61\u00b76), and for females it increased from 48\u00b75 years (48\u00b71-48\u00b78) to 65\u00b79 years (65\u00b75-66\u00b73), from 1990 to 2023. The highest all-cause mean age at death in 2023 was found in the high-income super-region, where the mean age for females reached 80\u00b79 years (80\u00b79-81\u00b70) and for males 74\u00b78 years (74\u00b78-74\u00b79). By comparison, the lowest all-cause mean age at death occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was 38\u00b70 years (37\u00b75-38\u00b74) for females and 35\u00b76 years (35\u00b72-35\u00b79) for males in 2023. Lastly, our study found that all-cause 70q0 decreased across each GBD super-region and region from 2000 to 2023, although with large variability between them. For females, we found that 70q0 notably increased from drug use disorders and conflict and terrorism. Leading causes that increased 70q0 for males also included drug use disorders, as well as diabetes. In sub-Saharan Africa, there was an increase in 70q0 for many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Additionally, the mean age at death from NCDs was lower than the expected mean age at death for this super-region. By comparison, there was an increase in 70q0 for drug use disorders in the high-income super-region, which also had an observed mean age at death lower than the expected value. We examined global mortality patterns over the past three decades, highlighting-with enhanced estimation methods-the impacts of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to broader trends such as increasing NCDs in low-income regions that reflect ongoing shifts in the global epidemiological transition. This study also delves into premature mortality patterns, exploring the interplay between age and causes of death and deepening our understanding of where targeted resources could be applied to further reduce preventable sources of mortality. We provide essential insights into global and regional health disparities, identifying locations in need of targeted interventions to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases. There is an ever-present need for strengthened health-care systems that are resilient to future pandemics and the shifting burden of disease, particularly among ageing populations in regions with high mortality rates. Robust estimates of causes of death are increasingly essential to inform health priorities and guide efforts toward achieving global health equity. The need for global collaboration to reduce preventable mortality is more important than ever, as shifting burdens of disease are affecting all nations, albeit at different paces and scales.

    "title": "Support for Alcohol Control Policies Among US Alcohol Consumers.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol control policies are associated with lower alcohol-related disability and death. Policymakers are more likely to adopt policies with higher public support, but it remains unknown which alcohol control policies currently garner the most public support in the US. To determine the extent to which US adults who consume alcohol support alcohol control policies and whether support differs by behavioral and demographic characteristics. This cross-sectional, online survey study of a nationally representative sample of US adults was conducted from September to October 2024. Adults aged 21 years or older who reported drinking at least 1 alcoholic beverage per week during the past 4 weeks were eligible. The primary outcome was support for alcohol control policies (eg, requiring cancer warnings on alcohol containers or increasing alcohol taxes) measured on a 1 (strongly oppose) to 5 (strongly support) response scale. Associations of behavioral and demographic characteristics with policy support were estimated using average differential effects (ADEs; ie, differences in estimated mean overall support between groups on the 1-5 scale) were calculated. A total of 1036 participants completed the survey (524 men [weighted percentage, 52%]; mean [SD] age, 49.4 [16.5] years; 138 [weighted percentage, 12%) Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish; 115 [weighted percentage, 11%] Black or African American; 681 [weighted percentage, 65%] White). Approximately one-half supported policies requiring alcohol containers to display cancer warnings (49%; 95% CI, 45% to 53%), drinks per container information (51%; 95% CI, 47% to 55%), and calorie content information (56%; 95% CI, 52%-60%). Likewise, 52% (95% CI, 48% to 56%) supported prohibiting alcohol advertisements on television when children are likely to be watching. Few participants (8% [95% CI, 6% to 11%] to 19% [95% CI, 16% to 23%]) opposed these policies. By contrast, fewer participants supported than opposed policies to lower the blood alcohol content limit for driving, prohibit alcohol sales late at night, and increase taxes on alcohol (range supporting: 16% [95% CI, 13% to 19%] to 25% [95% CI, 22% to 29%]); support was lowest for policies to reduce the number of outlets licensed to sell alcohol (10% [95% CI, 8% to 13%]). Across policies, support was greater among adults who reported drinking less often (ADE\u2009=\u2009-0.12; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.02); not binge drinking (ADE\u2009=\u2009-0.15; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.04); or reading the current alcohol health warning in the last 30 days (ADE\u2009=\u20090.14; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.28); and among those who were women (ADE\u2009=\u20090.22; 95% CI, 0.11-0.32); Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish (ADE\u2009=\u20090.16; 95% CI, 0.001-0.33); Democrats (ADE\u2009=\u20090.14; 95% CI, 0.01-0.27); or political independents (ADE\u2009=\u20090.16; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.29). In this survey study of US adults who consume alcohol, many supported advertising and labeling alcohol control policies, and few opposed these policies. These results suggest that policymakers may wish to pursue advertising and labeling policies as a ground-softening strategy to build support for stronger policies such as increasing taxes or restricting the times and places alcohol can be sold.",

    "abstract": "Menthol cigarette alternative products (e.g., menthol accessories, non-menthol cooling cigarettes) have entered the market and may bypass menthol cigarette restrictions. Understanding awareness, use, and substitution intentions if menthol cigarette sales are prohibited is important for assessing their potential to undermine the public health benefit of such policies. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2023 of N\u00a0=\u00a0116 Connecticut adults who smoked menthol cigarettes (mean age\u00a0=\u00a033.4, 50.9\u00a0% female, 50.9\u00a0% Black, 13.8\u00a0% Hispanic). We assessed awareness and ever use of menthol cigarette alternative products including menthol accessories (i.e., menthol filter capsules, sprays, cards, filter tips) and non-menthol cooling cigarettes with synthetic coolants. We measured substitution intentions to use each product if menthol cigarettes were restricted. Logistic regression models examined associations between sociodemographic and smoking characteristics and outcomes of awareness, ever use, and substitution intentions. Overall, 66.4% were aware of at least one type of menthol accessory, 41.4% had used one, and 80.2% reported substitution intentions if menthol cigarettes were restricted. Moreover, 39.6% were aware of non-menthol cooling cigarettes, 25.9% had used them, and 56.0% reported substitution intentions. Younger age was associated with awareness of menthol accessories and non-menthol cooling cigarettes. Higher nicotine dependence was associated with awareness, ever use, and substitution intentions across all products. We found considerable awareness, ever use, and substitution intentions of menthol cigarette alternative products among adults who smoke menthol cigarettes. Findings underscore the importance of comprehensive menthol cigarette restrictions that cover accessories and non-menthol cooling cigarettes to maximize public health.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the combined effect of two policies for reducing prescription opioid supply in Australia on hospital use by people prescribed opioids in primary care. Retrospective data linkage study; controlled interrupted time series analysis of linked primary care electronic medication records and hospital admissions data. Three Victorian health care networks (Monash Health, Eastern Health, Peninsula Health); pre-intervention period: 1 April 2018 - 31 March 2020; intervention period: 1 April 2020 - 31 March 2022. People prescribed opioid medications at least twice during the preceding six months (opioid group) and propensity score-matched patients, based on age, gender, comorbidity, and residential postcode-based socio-economic status (control group); matching was undertaken for each month of the study period. Mandatory prescription drug monitoring (from 1\u00a0April 2020); tighter restriction criteria for the subsidisation of opioid medications by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) (from 1 June 2020). Differences between the opioid and control groups in immediate changes after start of the intervention in rates of emergency department (ED) presentation and hospital admission related to opioid use, non-opioid substance use, self-harm, or mental health problems; differences between the two groups in the change in trend for these rates between the pre-intervention and intervention periods. Propensity matching was undertaken for 179\u2009091 people in the opioid group and a total of 389\u2009061 people in the control group. The opioid-related ED presentation rate for the opioid group had been increasing prior to the intervention, but declined after its introduction at a rate not significantly different from that of the control group. The immediate change in non-opioid substance-related ED presentation rate was greater for the opioid group than the control group (\u03b2, 11.1 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-20.5] presentations per 100\u2009000 patients); by 31 March 2022, the rate had declined to below the pre-intervention level. Differences between groups in changes to self-harm- and mental health-related presentations, and in all hospital admission rates, were not statistically significant. Following implementation of two prescription opioid supply-restricting polices in 2020, the opioid-related ED presentation rate declined among people prescribed opioids; the non-opioid substance-related presentation rate initially increased, but was lower than the pre-intervention level by the end of the study period. Our findings suggest that some opioid-restricting policies can reduce opioid-related harm without increasing long term non-opioid substance- or mental health-related harm.

    "abstract": "Early alcohol use is hazardous to health and restrictions to age at first drink (AFD) is a cornerstone of public health policy in many nations. We explored the long-term impact of AFD on mortality after early adulthood in community-dwelling Koreans. A cohort of 36\u2009159 adults aged 35-64\u2009years from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, linked to cause-of-death statistics, was followed up for a median of 9.9\u2009years. Based on AFD with a cutoff at South Korea's legal drinking age, the participants were divided into three groups: AFD\u2009<\u200919, AFD\u2009\u2265\u200919, and lifetime abstainer. The outcome variable was all-cause mortality. A total of 9723 (26.9%) participants reported AFD\u2009<\u200919. During the follow-up, 1073 (3.0%) participants died. AFD\u2009<\u200919 was associated with an increased risk of mortality than lifetime abstainers (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR] 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.64). Female drinkers with AFD\u2009<\u200919 showed an increased risk of mortality than female lifetime abstainers (aHR 2.02, CI 1.26-3.25). Current drinkers with AFD\u2009<\u200919 was associated with a greater risk of mortality than those with AFD\u2009\u2265\u200919 (aHR 1.20, 95%CI 1.01-1.42). Among participants with hazardous drinking habits, AFD\u2009<\u200919 was associated with a greater risk of mortality than AFD\u2009\u2265\u200919 (aHR 1.32, 95%CI 1.07-1.64). Individuals with AFD\u2009<\u200919 were at greater risk of mortality than lifetime abstainers; earlier AFD was associated with a greater mortality risk than later AFD.

    "abstract": "Firearm suicide among females has increased in the past decade; routes for prevention remain unclear. To identify classes of firearm suicide decedents among females based on preceding mental and physical health-related risk factors for suicide. This cross-sectional retrospective study of females who died by firearm suicide between January 2014 and December 2018 used state-based surveillance data from the National Violent Death Reporting System Restricted Access Database representing 1 or more years of data from all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico; data were analyzed from March 2022 to September 2023. A latent class analysis was used to identify and characterize categories of mental and physical health-related factors among females (ie, classes). Known mental and physical health-related risk factors for suicide. The numbers (percentages) of females who died by firearm suicide across various factors. Of the 8318 female decedents in our sample (mean [SD] age, 47.2 [17.0] years), more than half (4816 of 8318 [57.9%]) had more than 1 risk factor endorsed. Among this subgroup, a 4-class model was identified: (1) alcohol use disorder or substance use disorder (1273 [26.4%]); (2) depression and suicidal thoughts (2289 [47.5%]); (3) physical health problems and pain (1054 [21.9%]); and (4) all conditions (multimorbid; 200 [4.2%]); 3502 (42.1%) could not be classified. Black females made up a higher proportion (244 of 3502 [7.0%]) of the females with a 0 or 1 risk factor endorsed than of the females with multiple risk factors (184 of 4816 [3.8%]). Mental health problems were apparent in 51.7% of the full sample (4303 of 8318), with 28.6% (n\u2009=\u20092376) demonstrating evidence of mental health treatment. More than one-fifth (1766 of 8318 [21.2%]) had physical health problems. More than one-fourth of the full sample (2239 of 8318 [26.9%]) and nearly 40% (505 of 1273 [39.7%]) in class 1 had intimate partner problems before their death. In this cross-sectional study of females who died by firearm suicide, meaningfully distinct groups of female firearm suicide decedents were identified. Given the high proportion of females without mental health and physical health problems, it is plausible that many female firearm suicide decedents did not frequently intersect with the health care system before their death. Results suggest opportunities for preventing firearm suicide among females through nonmedical care settings.",

    "title": "Assessing Links Between Alcohol Exposure and Firearm Violence: A Scoping Review Update.",
    "abstract": "Firearm violence remains a leading cause of death and injury in the United States. Prior research supports that alcohol exposures, including individual-level alcohol use and alcohol control policies, are modifiable risk factors for firearm violence, yet additional research is needed to support prevention efforts. This scoping review aims to update a prior 2016 systematic review on the links between alcohol exposure and firearm violence to examine whether current studies indicate causal links between alcohol use, alcohol interventions, and firearm violence-related outcomes. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, a comprehensive search of published studies was conducted, replicating the search strategy of the prior review but focusing on studies published since 2015. The review included published studies of humans, conducted in general populations of any age, gender, or racial/ethnic group, that examined the relationship between an alcohol-related exposure and an outcome involving firearm violence or risks for firearm violence. Excluded were small studies restricted to special populations, forensic or other technical studies, non-original research articles such as reviews, and studies that relied solely on descriptive statistics or did not adjust for confounders. The review included published studies indexed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Eligible articles were published on or after January 1, 2015. The latest search was conducted on December 15, 2023. Using a structured data collection instrument, data were extracted on the characteristics of each study, including the dimension of alcohol exposure, the dimension of firearm violence, study population, study design, statistical analysis, source of funding, main findings, and whether effect measure modification was assessed and, if so, along what dimensions. Two authors independently conducted title/abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction until achieving 95% agreement, with discrepancies resolved through discussion. The search yielded 797 studies. Of these, 754 were excluded and 43 met the final inclusion criteria. Studies addressed a range of alcohol exposures and firearm violence-related outcomes, primarily with cross-sectional study designs; 40% considered effect measure modification by any population characteristic. Findings from the 21 studies examining the relationship of individual-level alcohol use or alcohol use disorder (AUD) with firearm ownership, access, unsafe storage, or carrying indicated a strong and consistent positive association. Seven studies examined associations of individual-level alcohol use or AUD with firearm injury or death; these also indicated a pattern of positive associations, but the magnitude and precision of the estimates varied. Eight studies examined the impact of neighborhood proximity or density of alcohol outlets and found mixed results that were context- and study design-dependent. Two studies linked prior alcohol-related offenses to increased risk of firearm suicide and perpetration of violent firearm crimes among a large cohort of people who purchased handguns, and two studies linked policies prohibiting firearm access among individuals with a history of alcohol-related offenses to reductions in firearm homicide and suicide. Finally, four studies examined alcohol control policies and found that greater restrictiveness was generally associated with reductions in firearm homicide or firearm suicide. Findings from this scoping review continue to support a causal relationship between alcohol exposures and firearm violence that extends beyond acute alcohol use to include AUD and alcohol-related policies. Policies controlling the availability of alcohol and prohibiting firearm access among individuals with alcohol-related offense histories show promise for the prevention of firearm violence. Additional research examining differential impacts by population subgroup, alcohol use among perpetrators of firearm violence, policies restricting alcohol outlet density, and randomized or quasi-experimental study designs with longitudinal follow-up would further support inferences to inform prevention efforts.",

    "abstract": "Smokeless tobacco (SLT) use is an established carcinogen to the nasal cavity, lip, and oropharynx, however, few studies have examined cancer risks in older African women among whom SLT use is common. We investigated snuff use and the risk of site-specific cancers among 15,336 newly diagnosed female cancer patients in the Johannesburg Cancer Study, South Africa. We designed case-control comparisons across multiple cancer outcomes: (a) known SLT-associated cancers; (b) other tobacco-related cancers and (c) genital cancers owing to intravaginal snuff use. Controls (n\u2009=\u20092961) comprised all other cancer patients. We also investigated (d) each control cancer type versus the remaining controls to explore possible associations with other cancers. Logistic models were fitted to estimate odds ratios adjusted for age, education, tobacco smoking, alcohol, HIV, and language. Overall, ever use of snuff was 22% among control cancers. Ever snuff use was associated with cervical (OR 1.14 [95%CI 1.00-1.30]) and eye and adnexa cancer (OR 1.95 [95%CI 1.03-3.70]). Associations with vulva cancer were less clear, 95% CI's for the main effects included 1 but a subgroup analysis restricted to never-smokers of current-versus-never users was positive (OR 2.10 [95%CI 1.25-3.50]). Surprisingly SLT users have lower risks of stomach cancer (OR 0.60 [95%CI 0.37-0.99]) and Hodgkin Lymphoma (OR 0.48 [95%CI 0.23-0.97]). Snuff use may increase the risk for cervical and vulva cancer in women, which is plausible via intravaginal use. Further research on the impact of SLT on female genital cancers with more detailed exposure data, including timing, intensity, and routes of use are required.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that is caused by hyperglycaemia. Our aim was to characterise the metabolomics to find their association with the glycaemic spectrum and find a causal relationship between metabolites and type 2 diabetes. As part of the Innovative Medicines Initiative - Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification (IMI-DIRECT) consortium, 3000 plasma samples were measured with the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p150 Kit and Metabolon analytics. A total of 911 metabolites (132 targeted metabolomics, 779 untargeted metabolomics) passed the quality control. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analysis estimates were calculated from the concentration/peak areas of each metabolite as an explanatory variable and the glycaemic status as a dependent variable. This analysis was adjusted for age, sex, BMI, study centre in the basic model, and additionally for alcohol, smoking, BP, fasting HDL-cholesterol and fasting triacylglycerol in the full model. Statistical significance was Bonferroni corrected throughout. Beyond associations, we investigated the mediation effect and causal effects for which causal mediation test and two-sample Mendelian randomisation (2SMR) methods were used, respectively. In the targeted metabolomics, we observed four (15), 34 (99) and 50 (108) metabolites (number of metabolites observed in untargeted metabolomics appear in parentheses) that were significantly different when comparing normal glucose regulation vs impaired glucose regulation/prediabetes, normal glucose regulation vs type 2 diabetes, and impaired glucose regulation vs type 2 diabetes, respectively. Significant metabolites were mainly branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), with some derivatised BCAAs, lipids, xenobiotics and a few unknowns. Metabolites such as lysophosphatidylcholine a C17:0, sum of hexoses, amino acids from BCAA metabolism (including leucine, isoleucine, valine, N-lactoylvaline, N-lactoylleucine and formiminoglutamate) and lactate, as well as an unknown metabolite (X-24295), were associated with HbA Our findings identify known BCAAs and lipids, along with novel N-lactoyl-amino acid metabolites, significantly associated with prediabetes and diabetes, that mediate the effect of diabetes from baseline to follow-up (18 and 48 months). Causal inference using genetic variants shows the role of lipid metabolism and n-3 fatty acids as being causal for metabolite-to-type 2 diabetes whereas the sum of hexoses is causal for type 2 diabetes-to-metabolite. Identified metabolite markers are useful for stratifying individuals based on their risk progression and should enable targeted interventions.",

    "title": "A Population-Based Study on Women Who Used Alcohol during Pregnancy and Their Neonates in Ontario, Canada.",
    "abstract": "Data from birth registries can be studied to assess the prevalence of prenatal alcohol use and associated maternal and neonatal outcomes. Linked maternal and neonatal data (2015-2018) for alcohol-exposed pregnancies were obtained from the Better Outcomes Registry and Network (BORN) Ontario. Descriptive statistics were generated for maternal demographics, prenatal substance use, mental health/substance use history, and neonatal outcomes. Logistic regression models were performed to assess the odds of prenatal heavy (binge or weekly) alcohol and other substance use based on mental health/substance use history and other maternal demographics, and the impacts of heavy alcohol use and other prenatal substance exposures on neonatal outcomes. A total of 10,172 (2.4%) women reported alcohol use during pregnancy. One-third had pre-existing or current mental health and/or substance use problems, which was associated with significantly higher odds of heavy alcohol use during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to heavy alcohol use was associated with increased odds of neonatal abstinence syndrome (2.5 times); respiratory distress syndrome (2.3 times); neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (58%); and hyperbilirubinemia (57%). Prenatal exposure to one or more substances in addition to alcohol was associated with significantly higher odds of fetal/maternal/placental pregnancy complications; preterm birth; NICU admission; low APGAR scores; one or more confirmed congenital anomalies at birth; respiratory distress syndrome; and intrauterine growth restriction. It is crucial to routinely screen childbearing-age and pregnant women for alcohol and other substance use as well as mental health problems in order to prevent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.",

    "title": "Comparative Safety of In Utero Exposure to Buprenorphine Combined With Naloxone vs Buprenorphine Alone.",
    "abstract": "Buprenorphine combined with naloxone is commonly used to treat opioid use disorders outside of pregnancy. In pregnancy, buprenorphine alone is generally recommended because of limited perinatal safety data on the combination product. To compare perinatal outcomes following prenatal exposure to buprenorphine with naloxone vs buprenorphine alone. Population-based cohort study using health care utilization data from Medicaid-insured beneficiaries in the US from 2000 to 2018. The cohort was restricted to pregnant individuals linked to their liveborn infants, with maternal Medicaid enrollment from 3 months before pregnancy to 1 month after delivery and infant enrollment for the first 3 months after birth, unless they died sooner. Use of buprenorphine with naloxone vs buprenorphine alone during the first trimester based on outpatient dispensings. Outcomes included major congenital malformations, low birth weight, neonatal abstinence syndrome, neonatal intensive care unit admission, preterm birth, respiratory symptoms, small for gestational age, cesarean delivery, and maternal morbidity. Confounder-adjusted risk ratios were calculated using propensity score overlap weights. This study identified 3369 pregnant individuals exposed to buprenorphine with naloxone during the first trimester (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [4.6] years) and 5326 exposed to buprenorphine alone or who switched from the combination to buprenorphine alone by the end of the first trimester (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [4.5] years). When comparing buprenorphine combined with naloxone with buprenorphine alone, a lower risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome (absolute risk, 37.4% vs 55.8%; weighted relative risk, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.70-0.84]) and a modestly lower risk for neonatal intensive care unit admission (absolute risk, 30.6% vs 34.9%; weighted relative risk, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.85-0.98]) and small for gestational age (absolute risk, 10.0% vs 12.4%; weighted relative risk, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.98]) was observed. For maternal morbidity, the comparative rates were 2.6% vs 2.9%, respectively, and the weighted relative risk was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.68-1.19). No differences were observed with respect to major congenital malformations overall, low birth weight, preterm birth, respiratory symptoms, or cesarean delivery. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses. There were similar and, in some instances, more favorable neonatal and maternal outcomes for pregnancies exposed to buprenorphine combined with naloxone compared with buprenorphine alone. For the outcomes assessed, compared with buprenorphine alone, buprenorphine with naloxone during pregnancy appears to be a safe treatment option. This supports the view that both formulations are reasonable options for the treatment of opioid use disorder in pregnancy, affirming flexibility in collaborative treatment decision-making.",

    "title": "State Policies Regulating Firearms and Changes in Firearm Mortality.",
    "abstract": "Despite high social and public health costs of firearm violence in the United States, the effects of many policies designed to reduce firearm mortality remain uncertain. To estimate the individual and joint effect sizes of state firearm policies on firearm-related mortality. In this comparative effectiveness study, bayesian methods were used to model panel data of annual, state-level mortality rates (1979-2019) for all US firearm decedents, with analyses conducted in October 2023. Six classes of firearms policies: background checks, minimum age, waiting periods, child access, concealed carry, and stand-your-ground laws. Primary outcomes (total firearm deaths, firearm homicide deaths, and firearm suicide deaths) were assessed using the National Vital Statistics System. Bayesian estimation was used to estimate the partial association of changes in firearms policies with subsequent changes in firearm mortality. The estimated effect sizes of individual policies 5 or more years after implementation were generally small in magnitude and had considerable uncertainty. The policy class with the highest probability of reducing firearm deaths was child-access prevention laws, estimated to reduce overall firearm mortality by 6% (80% credible interval [CrI], -2% to -9%). The policy class with the highest probability of increasing firearm deaths was stand-your-ground laws, estimated to increase firearm homicides by 6% (80% CrI, 0% to 13% increase). Estimates of association of implementing multiple firearm restrictions with subsequent changes in firearm mortality yielded larger effect sizes. Moving from the most permissive to most restrictive set of firearm policies was associated with an estimated 20% reduction in firearm deaths (80% CrI, 10% to 28% reduction), with a 0.99 probability of any reductions in firearm death rates. In this comparative effectiveness study of state firearm policies, the joint effect estimates of combinations of firearm laws were calculated, showing that restrictive firearm policies were associated with substantial reductions in firearm mortality. Although policymakers would benefit from knowing the effects of individual policies, the estimated changes in firearm mortality following implementation of individual policies were often small and uncertain.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE\nSuicide rates continue to be significantly higher in rural compared to urban communities in the United States, with the suicide rate disparity continuing to grow since 1999. This systematic review synthesizes rural-specific factors related to increased suicide risk.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOVID Medline, EMBASE, OVID PsycINFO, Web of Science, SocINDEX, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published after 2003 investigating rural adult suicide in the United States. Selection criteria were: (1) study participants > 18 years old; (2) included rural participants or communities; (3) included suicidal self-directed violence outcomes; (4) within the United States; (5) published after 2003; (6) presented peer-reviewed original data; (7) identified rural-specific risk or protective factors for suicide or barriers to treatment.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nOf the 1,058 records screened, 34 studies were included. The strength of evidence was relatively stronger for individual level factors including lethal means, alcohol and substance use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccess to firearms is strongly related to elevated rural US suicide rates, with substance use, economic stress, and behavioral health care utilization as additional individual level factors that may contribute to the disparity. At the community level, economic distress and access to care were commonly identified factors. Future research should better quantify how risk factors contribute to rural suicide and examine interdependence across social-ecological levels. Suicide prevention efforts for the rural United States must address access to lethal means, in particular the use of firearms, and navigate limited access to quality behavioral health care.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize evidence on treatment barriers among African-American women who seek treatment for substance use disorders. The authors reviewed articles from 1995 to 2018 on the topic of substance use disorders among African-American women. Based on the review of 13 articles, we found African-American women were more likely to encounter treatment readiness barriers compared to access barriers and system-related barriers. Personal and interpersonal barriers were more readily identified throughout the literature reviewed. However, African-American women did encounter other barriers such as access- and system-related barriers. In addition, the intersection of race, gender, and class was not addressed in the specific articles, but should be considered when working to remove treatment barriers for this population. While prevalence of alcohol and drug use is limited among African-American women, it is important to understand how treatment readiness barriers may limit successful completion of treatment and ongoing progress. Implications for treatment and future research in addressing barriers to treatment for African-American women are discussed.",

    "title": "HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis and Treatment as Prevention - Beliefs and Access Barriers in Men Who Have Sex With Men (MSM) and Transgender Women: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Purpose\nWhile the annual rate of new HIV infections and diagnoses has remained stable for most groups, troubling increases are seen in transgender women and racial/ethnic-minority men who have sex with men (MSM), groups that are disproportionately affected by HIV. The primary purpose of this systematic review is to examine factors that impact attitudes and beliefs about preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment as prevention (TasP) and to explore barriers to PrEP uptake in MSM and transgender women.\n\n\nMethods\nUsing MeSH terms and relevant keywords, we conducted a systematic review of studies published between 2010 and 2019. We searched 4 literature databases and identified studies on MSM and transgender women to elucidate perceptions of PrEP and TasP as well as barriers to access.\n\n\nResults\nThe search yielded several prominent themes associated with beliefs about HIV prevention approaches and barriers to PrEP access in MSM and transgender women. One was a lack of awareness or insufficient knowledge of PrEP and TasP. Structural barriers and geographic isolation also prevent access to HIV prevention. Sexual minority and HIV-related stigma, internalized homonegativity, and misinterpretations of messages within HIV prevention campaigns have negatively impacted PrEP uptake and beliefs about PrEP and TasP. Quality of the relationship MSM or transgender people have with their health care provider can facilitate or hinder HIV prevention. Finally, variability in beliefs about the efficacy of TasP has negatively affected the impact of TasP messaging campaigns.\n\n\nConclusions\nAlthough there is evidence of increasing PrEP use in at-risk individuals, several barriers prevent wider acceptance and uptake. Misunderstanding about the meaning of \"undetectable\" and skepticism about the evidence behind TasP messaging campaigns are likely to delay the World Health Organization's stated goal of getting to zero transmissions.",

    "title": "Barriers in Access to Dental Services Hindering the Treatment of People with Disabilities: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Background People with disabilities tend to have greater oral health problems compared to those without disabilities. This may be due to barriers they come across in accessing dental services. Objectives The objective of this systematic review was to provide a critical digest of the scientific literature concerning barriers and facilitators of access to oral health services for people with disabilities. Methods The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), and Brazilian Library of Dentistry (BBO) were searched using keywords relevant to the subject. The search was not restricted to specific languages or years of publication; all relevant studies were translated and reviewed. Results Sixteen studies including 14 articles, a doctoral thesis, and a monograph were selected, and their quality was analysed using the Downs and Black assessment tool. Barriers to dental services were divided into physical or nonphysical based on the dentist's perspective, as per the perception of parents/guardians or by the persons with disabilities. The barriers that emerged included the dentist's lack of preparation to assist people with disabilities, structural problems of access to dental offices, communication difficulties, and lack of awareness regarding the need for dental treatment for the disabled person. Conclusion It is concluded that people with disabilities continue to run into complex physical, behavioural, or multidimensional barriers in accessing dental services. Improved training of dentists for the care of this population is hereby emphasized. The legal framework enabling access to dental care for people with disabilities must also be respected in each country.",

    "title": "Barriers and facilitators to health technology adoption by older adults with chronic diseases: an integrative systematic review",
    "abstract": "In recent years, healthcare systems have progressively adopted several technologies enhancing access to healthcare for older adults and support the delivery of efficient and effective care for this specific population. These technologies include both assistive technologies designed to maintain or improve the independence, social participation and functionality of older people at home, as well as health information technology developed to manage long-term conditions. Examples of such technologies include telehealth, wearable devices and mobile health. However, despite the great promise that health technology holds for promoting independent living among older people, its actual implementation remains challenging. This study aimed to conduct an integrative systematic review of the research evidence on the factors that facilitate or hinder the adoption of different types of technology by older individuals with chronic diseases. For this purpose, four electronic databases (PsycArticles, Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed) were queried to search for indexed published studies. The methodological quality of the selected papers has been assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Twenty-nine articles were selected, including 6.213 adults aged 60 or older. The studies have been synthesised considering the types of technological interventions and chronic diseases, as well as the main barriers and facilitators in technology acceptance. The results revealed that the majority of the selected articles focused on comorbid conditions and the utilisation of telemedicine tools. With regard to hindering and facilitating factors, five main domains were identified: demographic and socioeconomic, health-related, dispositional, technology-related and social factors. The study results have practical implications not only for technology developers but also for all the social actors involved in the design and implementation of healthcare technologies, including formal and informal caregivers and policy stakeholders. These actors could use this work to enhance their understanding of the utilisation of technology by the ageing population. This review emphasises the factors that facilitate technology adoption and identifies barriers that impede it, with the ultimate goal of promoting health and independent living.",

    "title": "Interpreter services for immigrants in European healthcare systems: a systematic review of access barriers and facilitators",
    "abstract": "Background: Language barriers have been identified as a key access barrier to healthcare services for immigrants. The aim of this study was twofold: to investigate immigrants\u2019 and healthcare professionals\u2019 experiences with barriers and facilitators of interpreter services, and to examine the influence of barriers to interpreter services on the quality of care from immigrant and healthcare professional perspectives. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, SocINDEX and PsycINFO, resulting in 1425 studies. A total of 21 original quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies published between 1996 and 2021 were assessed as eligible for inclusion. Results: Identified barriers included: lack of immediately available interpreter services, cost, lack of knowledge about availability, and attitude towards interpreter services. Facilitators included: a high number of interpreters in the requested language, awareness among healthcare professionals and patients of the patient\u2019s rights to interpreters, and a positive attitude towards use of interpreter services. Regarding quality of care, language barriers created safety risks for the patients, made patients feel unsafe, or delayed patient contact with the healthcare system. Conclusions: Immigrant patients and healthcare professionals experience barriers in using interpreter services due to restrictive policies regarding user fees and limitations to entitlement to interpreters, a limited number of qualified interpreters and lack of knowledge. Medical encounters with unaddressed language barriers can put patients at risk and reduce quality of care for immigrants, which calls for strengthening formal and informal access to interpreters.",

    "abstract": "Background In sub-Saharan African countries (SSA), despite the efforts to enable adolescents to access sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, there are limited systematic review studies that comprehensively synthesize barriers to accessing services using a social-ecological model. Therefore, this review was conducted to fill this gap. Methods This study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42022259095). We followed PRISMA guideline to conduct this review. PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase and African Journal Online databases were used. Two authors individually screened articles. Only qualitative articles published in the English in last 10 years were included in this review. Results From the total of 4890 studies, 23 qualitative studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Those studies were from 11 SSA countries. This review finding revealed that inadequate information about the services, the incorrect perception about services, low self-esteem, fear of being noticed by family members, and financial constraints are barriers at the intrapersonal level. Unsupportive families and lack of open communication between adolescent-parent about sexuality issues were interpersonal barriers to access. Lack of provider competency, provider attitude, an unsupportive environment, physical inaccessibility of services, and shortage of medicine, and supplies were identified as institutional-level barriers. Moreover, community-level barriers like community stigma, social, religious, and gender norms within the society were identified as the main barriers to accessing services for adolescents. Conclusion This review finding reveals that the main barriers to access SRH services for adolescents living in SSA are misperception about services, low self-esteem to access services, financial constraints, unsupportive families, community stigma and social norms, unsupportive environments in health facilities, healthcare provider behavior, poor competency, being judgmental attitude, and breaking privacy and confidentiality. This study finding calls for new approach like a multi-pronged that works with service providers, with community, with families, and with adolescent to improve SRH services utilization of adolescent.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, substance use health services for treatment of alcohol use disorder and problematic alcohol use (AUD/PAU) were fragmented and challenging to access. The pandemic magnified system weaknesses, often resulting in disruptions of treatment as alcohol use during the pandemic rose. When treatment services were available, utilisation was often low for various reasons. Virtual care was implemented to offset the drop in in-person care, however accessibility was not universal. Identification of the characteristics of treatment services for AUD/PAU that impact accessibility, as perceived by the individuals accessing or providing the services, will provide insights to enable improved access. We will perform a scoping review that will identify characteristics of services for treatment of AUD/PAU that have been identified as barriers to or facilitators of service access from the perspectives of these groups. Methods and analysis We will follow scoping review methodological guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Using the OVID platform, we will search Ovid MEDLINE including Epub Ahead of Print and In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, APA PsychInfo, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CINAHL (Ebsco Platform). Multiple reviewers will screen citations. We will seek studies reporting data collected from individuals with AUD/PAU or providers of treatment for AUD/PAU on service-level factors affecting access to care. We will map barriers to and facilitators of access to AUD/PAU treatment services identified in the relevant studies, stratified by service type and key measures of inequity across service users. Ethics and dissemination This research will enhance awareness of existing evidence regarding barriers to and facilitators of access to services for the treatment of alcohol use disorder and problematic alcohol use. Findings will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations and a stakeholder meeting. As this is a scoping review of published literature, no ethics approval was required.",

Studies were retrieved from three databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science) and were screened and assessed independently by two raters. A thematic analysis was completed to determine the key barriers and facilitators reported by the included studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 73 studies were included. From these studies, 12 barriers and 13 facilitators were identified. Patients reported stigma, shame and guilt as the most prominent barrier affecting their engagement with treatment services. Meanwhile, caregivers and healthcare professionals reported a lack of eating disorder knowledge of clinicians as the most important barrier. Positive social support was cited as the most prominent facilitator to promote help-seeking.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nPatients, caregivers and healthcare professionals experience a variety of barriers and facilitators to treatment uptake for ED. Interventions addressing barriers and facilitators could increase treatment engagement, including anti-stigma campaigns and positive peer-support interventions.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review of eHealth Interventions Among Adolescents of Low Socioeconomic and Geographically Remote Backgrounds in Preventing Poor Diet, Alcohol Use, Tobacco Smoking and Vaping",
    "abstract": "Disadvantaged adolescents such as those of low socioeconomic and geographically remote backgrounds experience disproportionate chronic disease burden and tend to engage in greater risk behaviors including poor diet, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, and vaping. The social, structural, and economical barriers to health that uniquely affect adolescents of low socioeconomic and geographically remote backgrounds, such as stigma, access to and affordability of services, may partially explain their disadvantage in attaining health equity. Universal eHealth interventions can provide effective prevention, however, it is unclear whether they benefit disadvantaged adolescents, including those from low socioeconomic and geographically remote contexts. This study systematically reviewed the effectiveness of eHealth interventions targeting disadvantaged adolescents in preventing poor diet, alcohol use, tobacco smoking and vaping. Of 3278 identified records, 15 publications assessing 14 interventions were included, comprising 7170 youth (aged 9\u201318 years, 50.1% female, 56% low-mid SES, 33% remote). Nine interventions targeted poor diet, three targeted alcohol, one targeted tobacco, and one targeted alcohol and tobacco. No interventions targeted vaping. eHealth interventions significantly increased fruit and vegetable intake and percentage energy of nutrient-rich food, decreased sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, total energy intake, nutrient-poor food percentage energy consumption, and were associated with reduced binge drinking at 1-month follow-up among intervention completers. The findings of this study highlight that eHealth interventions can be effective in targeting poor diet and alcohol use among disadvantaged adolescents. However, due to the limited number of studies meeting inclusion criteria for this study, it is critical future research focus on developing and evaluating effective eHealth interventions targeting disadvantaged adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Harmful alcohol use among some groups of women is increasing globally. Despite being susceptible to negative health impacts, women are less likely than men to seek treatment and can face barriers of access, acceptability, and affordability to treatment. This study aims to identify key factors affecting treatment access for women with alcohol use disorders (AUDs), and to identify individual, social, and organizational factors that facilitate treatment uptake. Systematic review with narrative synthesis, guided by a social-ecological framework to identify organizational, individual, and societal enablers of treatment uptake among women with AUDs. Six electronic databases were systematically searched for studies published between 2000 and 2024 in high-income countries. Data on study design, sample characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and synthesized. Twenty-five studies, conducted in various countries, identified factors affecting women's treatment uptake. Key themes included individual motivators linked to problem perception, alcohol use severity, age, relationships, and family cohesion; societal motivators influenced by social norms and relationships; and organizational themes of accessibility, acceptability, and affordability were positively affected by healthcare provider knowledge of treatment options. Facilitating factors of treatment uptake for women with AUDs include relational and personal goals, societal environments, normative expectations, and the knowledge of alcohol treatment from individual and organizational perspectives. Sober curiosity movements, alcohol-free months, and digital strategies can positively impact women's alcohol treatment uptake. ",

    "abstract": "Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) are associated with numerous negative health and societal consequences. Relapse is common among individuals with AUD following discharge from treatment programs, often due to a lack of continuing care and barriers to accessing in-person interventions. Digital interventions may have the potential to overcome these barriers. This systematic review aims to assess the efficacy of digital interventions in supporting abstinence following AUD treatment. We searched the databases  Eleven studies were identified, with interventions including text messages, smartphones apps, wireless breathalysers, telephone-based support, and e-books. Four studies (2 using apps and 2 using supportive text messages) reported statistically significant results in prolonging abstinence. However, one intervention using a cue exposure therapy (CET) app found increased relapse rates in all groups. The risk of bias across studies ranged from moderate to high. There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of digital interventions in maintaining abstinence after AUD treatment discharge. While digital interventions may improve the accessibility and uptake of aftercare services to prevent relapse, further research is needed.",

    "title": "Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for alcohol use disorder: A systematic review of evidence and future potential.",
    "abstract": "While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) remains a highly effective psychotherapy approach for managing Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), its potential is hindered by workforce shortages and access barriers. In response to these challenges, Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) has emerged as an innovative solution that integrates the core CBT structure with technology. In iCBT, educational materials, therapist communication and progress dashboards can be centralized in a digital format, and delivered in a self-guided, therapist-guided or blended approach. In this systematic review we aimed to summarize the current evidence of iCBT for AUD. The study performed a comprehensive literature search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus in August 2023. Out of 497 studies that met our search criteria, five high-quality studies met our inclusion criteria. The studies presented a wide variation in the choice of outcomes and in the definition of controls or treatment as usual. When compared to treatment as usual, studies reported non-inferior to superior abstinence results of iCBT for AUD. Overall, most studies favor iCBT use as an adjunct to AUD treatment due to feasibility and access advantages. However, there were limitations identified in recruitment and implementation processes that warrant further studies. The review also showcases how studies on iCBT for AUD often neglect crucial variables such as insurance coverage, digital literacy and health equity. Clinical trials' investigators need to account for economic feasibility and external validity since the method design phase. iCBT may be an effective adjunct treatment for AUD. However, further research is required. Research in the field should entail larger trials with standard controls and outcome measures. It is also important to actively recruit participants from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds and adapt iCBT materials to different languages. This will allow a wider population to benefit from the treatment and address existing health disparities.",

    "title": "Patient and provider experiences with opioid use disorder care delivered via telehealth: A systematic mixed-studies review.",
    "abstract": "Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and loosening of some opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment regulations in the U.S. and Canada, there has been a rapid rise in the use of telehealth for buprenorphine induction, maintenance, and counseling (tele-bupe). Previous reviews highlight that tele-bupe can expand access to OUD care and improve treatment retention, but none to date have synthesized patient and clinician experiences with and perceptions of this care. This review synthesized findings from quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies that examined patient and provider experiences with tele-bupe. We assessed the perceived effectiveness and acceptability of this treatment modality. Our systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. In July 2023, we searched six databases using keywords 'telehealth AND opioid use disorder' (and related terms) for papers published in English. Papers were eligible for inclusion if they reported findings about patient or provider experiences. Two reviewers screened studies for inclusion; 40 studies were included. We used a data-based convergent synthesis design to extract and synthesize findings, and the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool to appraise studies. Patients and providers hold generally positive views of tele-bupe and most support its continued use in some form, citing multiple benefits, including accessibility and convenience. Most studies also identified barriers to tele-bupe, including technological challenges. Patients and providers differed in how they thought telehealth affects the clinical relationship, with providers expressing more concern about rapport-building and patients stating that being in their own environments during visits facilitated comfort and openness. The findings also suggest that providers are conflicted about when and for whom tele-bupe is appropriate. Overall, both patients and providers view tele-bupe favorably; however, providers are conflicted about the patients and situations for which it is appropriate, which may lead to inequities in who is offered this form of care.",

This was the first omnibus narrative systematic review of the contemporary qualitative literature on patient experiences of receiving these medications. Narrative systematic review using the sample, phenomenon of interest, design, evaluation and research framework. PubMed, Embase and APA PsycINFO were searched between 1 January 2000 and 14 June 2023, with the addition of hand searches. Qualitative and mixed methods studies among adults with experience of receiving OUD treatment medication in community and criminal justice settings. One reviewer conducted searches using the pre-registered strategy. Two independent reviewers screened studies and assessed quality using the Consolidation Criteria for Reporting Qualitative tool. Identified reports were first categorised using domains from the addiction dimensions for assessment and personalised treatment (an instrument developed to guide OUD treatment planning), then by narrative synthesis. From 1129 studies, 47 reports (published between 2005 and 2023) were included. Five major themes (and nine subthemes) were identified: (1) expectations about initiating treatment (barriers to access; motivations to receive medication); (2) responses to medication induction and stabilisation; (3) experience of the dispensing pharmacy (attending; medication dispensing); (4) experiences of maintenance treatment (services; dose adjustment; personal and social functioning); and (5) social factors (integration and stigma) and experiences of discontinuing treatment. Together these themes reflected and endorsed the importance of patient-centred care and clinically integrated services. Further qualitative research in real-world settings is needed on extended-release buprenorphine given the relative novelty of this medication option. A narrative systematic review of the qualitative studies of medications for OUD endorsed the importance of patient-centred care and clinically integrated services. CRD42019139365.",

    "title": "Factors that influence participation in physical activity for people with bipolar disorder: a synthesis of qualitative evidence.",
    "abstract": "Mental health problems contribute significantly to the overall disease burden worldwide and are major causes of disability, suicide, and ischaemic heart disease. People with bipolar disorder report lower levels of physical activity than the general population, and are at greater risk of chronic health conditions including cardiovascular disease and obesity. These contribute to poor health outcomes. Physical activity has the potential to improve quality of life and physical and mental well-being. To identify the factors that influence participation in physical activity for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder from the perspectives of service users, carers, service providers, and practitioners to help inform the design and implementation of interventions that promote physical activity. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and eight other databases to March 2021. We also contacted experts in the field, searched the grey literature, and carried out reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies. There were no language restrictions. We included qualitative studies and mixed-methods studies with an identifiable qualitative component. We included studies that focused on the experiences and attitudes of service users, carers, service providers, and healthcare professionals towards physical activity for bipolar disorder. We extracted data using a data extraction form designed for this review. We assessed methodological limitations using a list of predefined questions. We used the \"best fit\" framework synthesis based on a revised version of the Health Belief Model to analyse and present the evidence. We assessed methodological limitations using the CASP Qualitative Checklist. We used the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) guidance to assess our confidence in each finding. We examined each finding to identify factors to inform the practice of health and care professionals and the design and development of physical activity interventions for people with bipolar disorder. We included 12 studies involving a total of 592 participants (422 participants who contributed qualitative data to an online survey, 170 participants in qualitative research studies). Most studies explored the views and experiences of physical activity of people with experience of bipolar disorder. A number of studies also reported on personal experiences of physical activity components of lifestyle interventions. One study included views from family carers and clinicians. The majority of studies were from high-income countries, with only one study conducted in a middle-income country. Most participants were described as stable and had been living with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder for a number of years. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate or low confidence, as some findings were based on only small amounts of data, and the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, questioning the relevance of these findings to other settings. We also had very few perspectives of family members, other carers, or health professionals supporting people with bipolar disorder. The studies did not include any findings from service providers about their perspectives on supporting this aspect of care. There were a number of factors that limited people's ability to undertake physical activity. Shame and stigma about one's physical appearance and mental health diagnosis were discussed. Some people felt their sporting skills/competencies had been lost when they left school. Those who had been able to maintain exercise through the transition into adulthood appeared to be more likely to include physical activity in their regular routine. Physical health limits and comorbid health conditions limited activity. This included bipolar medication, being overweight, smoking, alcohol use, poor diet and sleep, and these barriers were linked to negative coping skills. Practical problems included affordability, accessibility, transport links, and the weather. Workplace or health schemes that offered discounts were viewed positively. The lack of opportunity for exercise within inpatient mental health settings was a problem. Facilitating factors included being psychologically stable and ready to adopt new lifestyle behaviours. There were positive benefits of being active outdoors and connecting with nature. Achieving balance, rhythm, and routine helped to support mood management. Fitting physical activity into a regular routine despite fluctuating mood or motivation appeared to be beneficial if practised at the right intensity and pace. Over- or under-exercising could be counterproductive and accelerate depressive or manic moods. Physical activity also helped to provide a structure to people's daily routines and could lead to other positive lifestyle benefits. Monitoring physical or other activities could be an effective way to identify potential triggers or early warning signs. Technology was helpful for some. People who had researched bipolar disorder and had developed a better understanding of the condition showed greater confidence in managing their care or providing care to others. Social support from friends/family or health professionals was an enabling factor, as was finding the right type of exercise, which for many people was walking. Other benefits included making social connections, weight loss, improved quality of life, and better mood regulation. Few people had been told of the benefits of physical activity. Better education and training of health professionals could support a more holistic approach to physical and mental well-being. Involving mental health professionals in the multidisciplinary delivery of physical activity interventions could be beneficial and improve care. Clear guidelines could help people to initiate and incorporate lifestyle changes. There is very little research focusing on factors that influence participation in physical activity in bipolar disorder. The studies we identified suggest that men and women with bipolar disorder face a range of obstacles and challenges to being active. The evidence also suggests that there are effective ways to promote managed physical activity. The research highlighted the important role that health and care settings, and professionals, can play in assessing individuals' physical health needs and how healthy lifestyles may be promoted. Based on these findings, we have provided a summary of key elements to consider for developing physical activity interventions for bipolar disorder.",

    "title": "Barriers to engagement in the care cascade for tuberculosis disease in India: A systematic review of quantitative studies.",
    "abstract": "India accounts for about one-quarter of people contracting tuberculosis (TB) disease annually and nearly one-third of TB deaths globally. Many Indians do not navigate all care cascade stages to receive TB treatment and achieve recurrence-free survival. Guided by a population/exposure/comparison/outcomes (PECO) framework, we report findings of a systematic review to identify factors contributing to unfavorable outcomes across each care cascade gap for TB disease in India. We defined care cascade gaps as comprising people with confirmed or presumptive TB who did not: start the TB diagnostic workup (Gap 1), complete the workup (Gap 2), start treatment (Gap 3), achieve treatment success (Gap 4), or achieve TB recurrence-free survival (Gap 5). Three systematic searches of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1, 2000 to August 14, 2023 were conducted. We identified articles evaluating factors associated with unfavorable outcomes for each gap (reported as adjusted odds, relative risk, or hazard ratios) and, among people experiencing unfavorable outcomes, reasons for these outcomes (reported as proportions), with specific quality or risk of bias criteria for each gap. Findings were organized into person-, family-, and society-, or health system-related factors, using a social-ecological framework. Factors associated with unfavorable outcomes across multiple cascade stages included: male sex, older age, poverty-related factors, lower symptom severity or duration, undernutrition, alcohol use, smoking, and distrust of (or dissatisfaction with) health services. People previously treated for TB were more likely to seek care and engage in the diagnostic workup (Gaps 1 and 2) but more likely to suffer pretreatment loss to follow-up (Gap 3) and unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4), especially those who were lost to follow-up during their prior treatment. For individual care cascade gaps, multiple studies highlighted lack of TB knowledge and structural barriers (e.g., transportation challenges) as contributing to lack of care-seeking for TB symptoms (Gap 1, 14 studies); lack of access to diagnostics (e.g., X-ray), non-identification of eligible people for testing, and failure of providers to communicate concern for TB as contributing to non-completion of the diagnostic workup (Gap 2, 17 studies); stigma, poor recording of patient contact information by providers, and early death from diagnostic delays as contributing to pretreatment loss to follow-up (Gap 3, 15 studies); and lack of TB knowledge, stigma, depression, and medication adverse effects as contributing to unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4, 86 studies). Medication nonadherence contributed to unfavorable treatment outcomes (Gap 4) and TB recurrence (Gap 5, 14 studies). Limitations include lack of meta-analyses due to the heterogeneity of findings and limited generalizability to some Indian regions, given the country's diverse population. This systematic review illuminates common patterns of risk that shape outcomes for Indians with TB, while highlighting knowledge gaps-particularly regarding TB care for children or in the private sector-to guide future research. Findings may inform targeting of support services to people with TB who have higher risk of poor outcomes and inform multicomponent interventions to close gaps in the care cascade.",

    "abstract": "Substance use during the perinatal period (i.e., pregnancy through the first year postpartum) can pose significant maternal and infant health risks. However, access to lifesaving medications and standard care remains low for perinatal persons who use substances. This lack of substance use disorder treatment access stems from fragmented services, stigma, and social determinants of health-related barriers that could be addressed using patient navigators. This systematic review describes patient navigation models of care for perinatal people who use substances and associated outcomes. We conducted a structured search of peer-reviewed, US-focused, English- or Spanish-language articles from 2000 to 2023 focused on 1) patient navigation, 2) prenatal and postpartum care, and 3) substance use treatment programs using PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. After meeting eligibility criteria, 17 studies were included in this review. The majority (n=8) described outpatient patient navigation programs, with notable hospital (n=4) and residential (n=3) programs. Patient navigation was associated with reduced maternal substance use, increased receipt of services, and improved maternal and neonatal health. Findings were mixed for engagement in substance use disorder treatment and child custody outcomes. Programs that co-located care, engaged patients across the perinatal period, and worked to build trust and communication with family members and service providers were particularly successful. Patient navigation may be a promising strategy for improving maternal and infant health outcomes among perinatal persons who use substances. More experimental research is needed to test the effect of patient navigation programs for perinatal persons who use substances compared to other models of care.",

    "title": "Mounting Stroke Crisis in India: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Stroke, a neurological disorder, has emerged as a formidable health challenge in India, with its incidence on the rise. Increased risk factors, which also correlate with economic prosperity, are linked to this rise, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and alcohol intake. Particularly worrisome is the impact on young adults, a pivotal segment of India's workforce. Stroke encompasses various clinical subtypes and cerebrovascular disorders (CVDs), contributing to its multifaceted nature. Globally, stroke's escalating burden is concerning, affecting developing nations. To combat this trend effectively and advance prevention and treatment strategies, comprehensive and robust data on stroke prevalence and impact are urgently required. In India, these encompass individuals with elevated BMIs, and those afflicted by hypertension, diabetes, or a familial history of stroke. Disparities in stroke incidence and prevalence manifest across India, with differences in urban and rural settings, gender-based variations, and regional disparities. Early detection, dietary changes, effective risk factor management, and equitable access to stroke care are required to address this issue. Government initiatives, like the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Stroke (NPCDCS) 2019, provide guidelines, but effective implementation and awareness campaigns are vital. Overcoming barriers to stroke care, especially in rural areas, calls for improved infrastructure, awareness campaigns, and support systems. Data standardization and comprehensive population studies are pivotal for informed public health policies.",

    "title": "The effectiveness of abstinence-based and harm reduction-based interventions in reducing problematic substance use in adults who are experiencing homelessness in high income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Homelessness is a traumatic experience, and can have a devastating effect on those experiencing it. People who are homeless often face significant barriers when accessing public services, and have often experienced adverse childhood events, extreme social disadvantage, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, neglect, low self-esteem, poor physical and mental health, and much lower life expectancy compared to the general population. Rates of problematic substance use are disproportionately high, with many using drugs and alcohol to deal with the stress of living on the street, to keep warm, or to block out memories of previous abuse or trauma. Substance dependency can also create barriers to successful transition to stable housing. To understand the effectiveness of different substance use interventions for adults experiencing homelessness. The primary source of studies for was the 4th edition of the Homelessness Effectiveness Studies Evidence and Gaps Maps (EGM). Searches for the EGM were completed in September 2021. Other potential studies were identified through a call for grey evidence, hand-searching key journals, and unpacking relevant systematic reviews. Eligible studies were impact evaluations that involved some comparison group. We included studies that tested the effectiveness of substance use interventions, and measured substance use outcomes, for adults experiencing homelessness in high income countries. Descriptive characteristics and statistical information in included studies were coded and checked by at least two members of the review team. Studies selected for the review were assessed for confidence in the findings. Standardised effect sizes were calculated and, if a study did not provide sufficient raw data for the calculation of an effect size, author(s) were contacted to obtain these data. We used random-effects meta-analysis and robust-variance estimation procedures to synthesise effect sizes. If a study included multiple effects, we carried out a critical assessment to determine (even if only theoretically) whether the effects are likely to be dependent. Where dependent effects were identified, we used robust variance estimation to determine whether we can account for these. Where effect sizes were converted from a binary to continuous measure (or vice versa), we undertook a sensitivity analysis by running an additional analysis with these studies omitted. We also assessed the sensitivity of results to inclusion of non-randomised studies and studies classified as low confidence in findings. All included an assessment of statistical heterogeneity. Finally, we undertook analysis to assess whether publication bias was likely to be a factor in our findings. For those studies that we were unable to include in meta-analysis, we have provided a narrative synthesis of the study and its findings. We included 48 individual papers covering 34 unique studies. The studies covered 15, 255 participants, with all but one of the studies being from the United States and Canada. Most papers were rated as low confidence ( Although our analysis of harm reduction versus treatment as usual, abstinence versus treatment as usual, and harm reduction versus abstinence suggests that these different approaches make little real difference to the outcomes achieved in comparison to treatment as usual. The findings suggest that some individual interventions are more effective than others. The overall low quality of the primary studies suggests that further primary impact research could be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Services to treat problematic alcohol use (PAU) should be highly accessible to optimize treatment engagement. We conducted a scoping review to map characteristics of services for the treatment of PAU that have been reported in the literature to be barriers to or facilitators of access to treatment from the perspective of individuals with PAU. A protocol was developed  One-hundred-and-nine included studies reported an extensive array of unique service-level barriers that could act alone or together to prevent treatment accessibility. These included but were not limited to lack of an obvious entry point, complexity of the care pathway, high financial cost, unacceptably long wait times, lack of geographically accessible treatment, inconvenient appointment hours, poor cultural/demographic sensitivity, lack of anonymity/privacy, lack of services to treat concurrent PAU and mental health problems. Barriers generally aligned with recent reviews of the substance use disorder literature. Ranking of barriers may be explored in a future discrete choice experiment of PAU service users. The rich qualitative findings of this review may support the design of new or modification of existing services for people with PAU to improve accessibility.

    "title": "A Comprehensive Literature Review of Digital Health Interventions in the Treatment of Substance Use Disorder With Special Focus on Mobile Applications",
    "abstract": "COVID-19 quarantine showed an increase in opioid-related deaths partially due to the limited capacity of clinics and treatment centers. Digital health interventions (DHIs) such as telehealth have improved access to treatment, reduced psychosocial barriers, and helped patients with substance use disorder (SUD). An in-depth literature review was conducted to gauge the efficacy and usefulness of DHIs on substance use disorder. PubMed was used with string search terms to identify studies analyzing telehealth for substance use disorders. Studies were eligible and selected if they used health interventions (HIs) and reported outcomes on the efficacy of DHIs, benefits of DHIs, and limitations of DHIs. The Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) was used to analyze the impact of DHIs on SUD. Lastly, Apple\u2019s App Store was used to identify the current DHI available. The analysis indicated that mobile phone apps were the most appropriate sources to use for patients with substance use disorders. The search also found 36 mobile applications available on the market for patients, containing mainly pain medication diaries and trackers. The study did not find any apps for clinical usage that met the standards necessary for adequate healthcare in the opioid crisis, largely due to a lack of clinician involvement in using applications. Developing adequate DHIs has the potential to improve outcomes in patients with SUD and aid in recovery time. The research concluded that physicians looking to develop DHIs should take into consideration the mode of delivery of DHI, the aim to produce specific health outcomes as opposed to multiple outcomes, and clinician involvement in DHI development. DHIs can become a vital tool for medical professionals, especially during the COVID-19 crisis, as the use of healthcare technology has limited in-person contact, maintained current doctor-patient relationships, and allowed for contact tracing of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Emotion regulation is increasingly recognized as important for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorder (SUD). However, there is an identified lack of physiological indexes of emotion dysregulation in SUD treatment studies, critically needed to better understand the link between emotion regulation capacity (measured physiologically) and self-report health outcomes among individuals in SUD treatment. Objective: To examine the association between respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and self-report health outcomes among women in SUD treatment. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study based on baseline data from 217 women enrolled in a randomized control trial to study a mind-body intervention as an adjunct to SUD treatment. All participants were enrolled in community-based outpatient treatment. Participants were administered questionnaires to examine sample characteristics, mental health symptoms, and interoceptive awareness and mindfulness skills. RSA data was gathered as an index of emotion dysregulation. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and regression were used in the analyses. Results: Findings highlight the extensive trauma histories, low SES, and the high symptoms of distress in this sample. RSA was only significantly correlated with interoceptive awareness after controlling for age and BMI. Measures of symptomatic distress and mindfulness were not correlated with RSA. Conclusions/Importance: Results provide the first evidence of RSA as an index of interoceptive awareness in this population. The inclusion of biomarkers such as RSA in SUD clinical studies may help identify individuals that are in need of targeted treatments that include interoceptive awareness training focused on improving emotion regulation.",

Digital inequalities, such as limited access to technology, skills to leverage the technology for desirable outcomes, and social resources, may be contributing to negative health outcomes. In addition, broader health literacy plays an integral part in the capacity of individuals to appraise opioid medication-related online information. This paper explores the role of digital inequalities in the uptake of treatment for opioid use disorder. Given the shift toward telemedicine and online counseling for substance use treatment as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, more research into the digital inequalities faced by those who misuse opioids may provide insight into ways of engaging and encouraging this population to utilize treatment.",

    "title": "Open-label dose-extending placebos for opioid use disorder: a protocol for a randomised controlled clinical trial with methadone treatment",
    "abstract": "Introduction More than 2\u2009million individuals in the USA have an opioid use disorder (OUD). Methadone maintenance treatment is the gold standard of medication-based treatment for OUD, but high-dose methadone is associated with cardiotoxicity and respiratory complications, among other side effects. These adverse effects make enhancing the effectiveness of lower doses of methadone an attractive therapeutic goal. Long recognised for its capacity to enhance treatment outcomes for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including pain, the placebo effect offers an as-yet untested avenue to such an enhancement. This approach is particularly compelling given that individuals with substance use disorder tend to have higher salience attribution and may thereby be more sensitive to placebo effects. Our study combines two promising clinical methodologies\u2014conditioning/dose-extension and open-label placebo\u2014to investigate whether placebo effects can increase the effective potency of methadone in treatment-seeking OUD patients. Methods and analysis A total of 120 newly enrolled treatment-seeking OUD patients will be randomly assigned to one of two different groups: either methadone plus daily placebo dose-extension (PDE; treatment group) or methadone/treatment as usual (control). Participants will meet with study team members five times over the course of 3\u2009months of treatment with methadone (baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 months postbaseline). Throughout this study time period, methadone dosages will be adjusted by an addiction clinician blind to patient assignment, per standard clinical methods. The primary outcome is methadone dose at 3\u2009months. Secondary outcomes include self-report of drug use; 3-month urine toxicology screen results; and treatment retention. Exploratory outcomes include several environmental as well as personality factors associated with OUD and with propensity to demonstrate a placebo effect. Ethics and dissemination Human subjects oversight for this study is provided by the University of Maryland, Baltimore and University of Maryland, College Park Institutional Review Boards. Additionally, the study protocol is reviewed annually by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Study results will be disseminated via research conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications. Trial registration number NCT02941809.",

    "title": "Safety of rapid inpatient methadone initiation protocol: A retrospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nCurrent methadone titration guidelines recommend low initial doses (15-40\u202fmg) and slow increases (10-20\u202fmg every 3 to 7\u202fdays) to prevent dose accumulation and oversedation until reaching a target therapeutic dose between 60 and 120\u202fmg. These guidelines were created primarily for outpatient settings in the pre-fentanyl era. Methadone initiations are becoming more common in hospitals, but no titration guidelines exist specific to this treatment setting, which has capacity for increased monitoring. Our objective was to assess the safety of rapid inpatient methadone initiation with regard to mortality, overdose, and serious adverse outcomes both in-hospital and postdischarge.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis is a retrospective, observational, cohort study conducted at an urban, academic medical center in the United States. We queried our electronic medical record for hospitalized adults with moderate to severe opioid use disorder admitted between July 1, 2018, and November 30, 2021. Included patients were rapidly initiated on methadone with 30\u202fmg as the initial dose and 10\u202fmg increases daily until reaching 60\u202fmg. The study extracted thirty-day post-discharge opioid overdose and mortality data from the CRISP database.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-five hospitalized patients received rapid methadone initiation during the study period. The study had no major adverse events including in-hospital or thirty-day post-discharge overdoses or deaths. The study did have two instances of sedation, but neither led to methadone dose holds. There were no instances of QTc prolongation. The study had one patient-directed discharge.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrated that a small subset of hospitalized patients tolerated rapid methadone initiation. More rapid titrations can be utilized in a monitored inpatient setting to retain patients in the hospital and allow providers to account for increased tolerance in the fentanyl era. Guidelines should be updated to reflect the capabilities of inpatient settings to safely initiate and rapidly titrate methadone. Further work should determine optimal methadone initiation protocols in the fentanyl era.",

    "abstract": "Background: Treatment for substance use disorders (SUD) remains low in the United States. To better meet needs of people who use alcohol and other drugs, low threshold bridge clinics which offer treatment without barrier and harm reduction services have gained prevalence. Bridge clinics work to surmount barriers to care by providing same day medication and treatment for SUD and eventually transitioning patients to community-based treatment providers. In this study, we examine SUD treatment outcomes among patients who transitioned out of a bridge clinic. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of posttreatment outcomes of patients seen at an urban medical center\u2019s bridge clinic between 2017 and 2022. The primary outcome was being in care anywhere at time of follow-up. We also examined the proportion of patients who completed each step of the cascade of care following transfer: connection to transfer clinic, completion of a clinic visit, retention in care, and medication use among those remaining in care at the transfer clinic. We examined the association of different bridge clinic services with still being in care anywhere and the association between successful transfer with being in care and taking medication at follow-up. Results: Of 209 eligible participants, 63 were surveyed. Sixty-five percent of participants identified as male, 74% as white, 12% as Hispanic, 6% as Black, and 16% were unhoused. Most participants (78%) reported being connected to SUD treatment from the Bridge Clinic, and 37% remained in care at the same facility at the time of survey. Eighty-four percent reported being in treatment anywhere and 68% reported taking medication for SUD at follow-up, with most participants reporting taking buprenorphine (46%). Conclusion: Of those participants who transitioned out of a bridge clinic into community-based SUD care, 78% were successfully connected to ongoing care and 84% were still in care at follow-up.",

    "title": "Three decades of research in substance use disorder treatment for syringe services program participants: a scoping review of the literature",
    "abstract": "Background Syringe services programs (SSPs) provide a spectrum of health services to people who use drugs, with many providing referral and linkage to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, and some offering co-located treatment with medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The objective of this study was to review the evidence for SSPs as an entry point for SUD treatment with particular attention to co-located (onsite) MOUD. Methods We performed a scoping review of the literature on SUD treatment for SSP participants. Our initial query in PubMed led to title and abstract screening of 3587 articles, followed by full text review of 173, leading to a final total of 51 relevant articles. Most articles fell into four categories: (1) description of SSP participants\u2019 SUD treatment utilization; (2) interventions to link SSP participants to SUD treatment; (3) post-linkage SUD treatment outcomes; (4) onsite MOUD at SSPs. Results SSP participation is associated with entering SUD treatment. Barriers to treatment entry for SSP participants include: use of stimulants, lack of health insurance, residing far from treatment programs, lack of available appointments, and work or childcare responsibilities. A small number of clinical trials demonstrate that two interventions (motivational enhancement therapy with financial incentives and strength-based case management) are effective for linking SSP participants to MOUD or any SUD treatment. SSP participants who initiate MOUD reduce their substance use, risk behaviors, and have moderate retention in treatment. An increasing number of SSPs across the United States offer onsite buprenorphine treatment, and a number of single-site studies demonstrate that patients who initiate buprenorphine treatment at SSPs reduce opioid use, risk behaviors, and have similar retention in treatment to patients in office-based treatment programs. Conclusions SSPs can successfully refer participants to SUD treatment and deliver onsite buprenorphine treatment. Future studies should explore strategies to optimize the implementation of onsite buprenorphine. Because linkage rates were suboptimal for methadone, offering onsite methadone treatment at SSPs may be an appealing solution, but would require changes in federal regulations. In tandem with continuing to develop onsite treatment capacity, funding should support evidence-based linkage interventions and increasing accessibility, availability, affordability and acceptability of SUD treatment programs.",

    "abstract": "Background The misuse of and addiction to opioids is a national crisis that affects public health as well as social and economic welfare. There is an urgent need for strategies to improve opioid use disorder treatment quality (e.g., 6-month retention). Substance use disorder treatment programs are challenged by limited resources and a workforce that does not have the requisite experience or education in quality improvement methods. The purpose of this study is to test a multicomponent clinic-level intervention designed to aid substance use disorder treatment clinics in implementing quality improvement processes to improve high-priority indicators of treatment quality for opioid use disorder. Methods A stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial with 30 outpatient treatment clinics serving approximately 2000 clients with opioid use disorder each year will test whether a clinic-level measurement-driven, quality improvement intervention, called Coaching for Addiction Recovery Enhancement (CARE), improves (a) treatment process quality measures (use of medications for opioid use disorder, in-treatment symptom and therapeutic progress, treatment retention) and (b) recovery outcomes (substance use, health, and healthcare utilization). The CARE intervention will have the following components: (1) staff clinical training and tools, (2) quality improvement and change management training, (3) external facilitation to support implementation and sustainability of quality improvement processes, and (4) an electronic client-reported treatment progress tool to support data-driven decision making and clinic-level quality measurement. The study will utilize multiple sources of data to test study aims, including state administrative data, client-reported survey and treatment progress data, and staff interview and survey data. Discussion This study will provide the field with a strong test of a multicomponent intervention to improve providers\u2019 capacity to make systematic changes tied to quality metrics. The study will also result in training and materials that can be shared widely to increase quality improvement implementation and enhance clinical practice in the substance use disorder treatment system.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Pregnant women with substance use disorder often fail to complete treatment. Treatment retention can be influenced by many factors, including CPS involvement. This study evaluates the relationship, if any, between active CPS involvement while in treatment and treatment outcomes. Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of data from 127 patients from the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, MD. The sample included 92 women with active CPS cases and 35 individuals without current CPS involvement. A log binomial regression with robust variance was used to estimate the relative risks of treatment completion and time spent in treatment (\u226590\u2009days vs. <90\u2009days) between the active CPS-involved and uninvolved groups. Statistical significance was noted at a level of p\u2009<\u20090.05. Results: Women with active CPS involvement during their admission were significantly more likely to spend at least 90\u2009days in treatment (OR = 1.78, CI = [1.09, 2.93]). The active CPS group also trended toward higher rates of treatment completion (RR = 1.41, CI = [0.78, 2.57]), although this finding was not statistically significant. Conclusions: In this real-world clinical sample, active CPS involvement was not associated with early SUD treatment discontinuation, however this did not translate to significant differences in rates of treatment completion. Additionally, prospective research to evaluate how the potential for CPS involvement may affect enrollment in SUD treatment would also help direct patient counseling.",

Target patients (n\u2009=\u2009243) presented to the ED for a possible opioid-related reason. The primary outcome was overdose-related ED re-presentation. Key secondary outcomes included OUD medication treatment linkage, duration of medication in days, all-cause ED re-presentation, all-cause inpatient re-presentation, and Medicaid enrollment. All outcomes were assessed at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-enrollment. Ad hoc analyses were performed to assess treatment motivation and readiness. Results: POINT and standard care participants did not differ significantly on any outcomes measured. Participants who presented to the ED for overdose had significantly lower scores (3.5 vs 4.2, P\u2009<\u2009.01) regarding readiness to begin treatment compared to those presenting for other opioid-related issues. Conclusions: This is the first randomized trial investigating overdose outcomes for an ED peer recovery support specialist intervention. Though underpowered, results suggest no benefit of PRSS services over standard care. Given the scope of PRSS, future work in this area should assess more recovery- and harm reduction-oriented outcomes, as well as the potential benefits of integrating PRSS within multimodal ED-based interventions for OUD.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders (SUDs) take a heavy toll on those who have them and on society more broadly. These disorders are often difficult to treat, and relapse is common. Perhaps, because of these factors, these disorders are highly stigmatized worldwide. The purpose of this study is to examine empirical work intended to determine the impact of perceived social stigma and self-stigma on the process of recovering from SUDs with the assistance of formal treatment services. Qualitative studies confirmed that stigma experiences are common among those with these disorders and that these experiences can negatively impact feelings and beliefs about treatment. One quantitative study provided good statistical support for a direct effect of stigma on outcomes, but this was contradicted by other longitudinal data. In general, quantitative articles suggested an indirect effect of stigma on treatment outcomes, via negative emotions and cognitive mechanisms such as feelings of self-efficacy. However, it was notable that there was little consistency in the literature as to definitions and measurement of the constructs of recovery, perceived social stigma, and self-stigma. Future work should focus on bringing clarity, and validated measures, to this problem in order to better determine the nature of these relationships.",

    "abstract": "Release from prison or jail is a high-risk time for HIV acquisition, yet prior efforts to expand access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and other HIV prevention services for people releasing from jail or prison have faced substantial implementation barriers. Characterize the implementation landscape for HIV prevention for people releasing from prison or jail in Washington State, gathering input from staff at carceral institutions and community-based organizations to inform implementation of evidence-based HIV prevention strategies. Qualitative study. Healthcare and reentry staff in prisons and jails (n\u2009=\u200915) and staff at community-based organizations that may serve people releasing from jail or prison (n\u2009=\u200920), selected through chain referral sampling. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted to theoretical saturation, then coded using a mixed inductive-deductive approach, based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Carceral institutions had few programs aimed specifically at HIV prevention. Carceral institutions had PrEP available but did not offer it widely, focusing on behavioral health or acute medical needs. Some community-based organizations offered PrEP or other forms of HIV prevention, but many focused on meeting basic needs or building community. Five themes characterized the implementation landscape for HIV prevention: 1) primacy of basic needs means HIV prevention is lower priority, 2) adding HIV prevention programming would require new funding, 3) differences in culture and philosophy influence interest in providing PrEP, 4) disconnection between carceral institutions and providers in the community limits linkage to care, 5) organizations balance protecting confidentiality while coordinating care. Rather than directly focusing on HIV prevention, carceral institutions and community-based organizations often focused on substance use disorder treatment, and there are opportunities to integrate additional HIV prevention education and interventions into substance use care. Closer relationships between carceral institutions and community organizations may improve care coordination but would require staff capacity.",

    "abstract": "Impaired decision-making is often seen in people with bipolar disorder (BD), even those undergoing treatment. Targeted therapeutics are therefore needed. People with BD report that cannabis use (CU) attenuates such cognitive and behavioral symptoms. We hypothesized that 1) people with BD who do not use cannabis would exhibit poor decision-making and functional capacity relative to healthy comparison (HC) participants and 2) CU in people with BD would be associated with decision-making and functional capacity comparable to that of HC participants who do not use cannabis. HC and BD participants that either reported regular (\u22654x/weekly) CU or no-CU were recruited (n\u2009=\u200987). Participants were tested on decision-making and functional capacity using the Iowa Gambling Task and UCSD Performance-based skills assessment (UPSA-2), respectively. CU was associated with impaired decision-making in healthy participants while CU in participants with BD was associated with better decision-making than their non-using counterparts and equivalent to decision-making in non-CU HC participants. Additionally, CU in people with BD was associated with UPSA-2 scores comparable to non-CU HC participants. Studies are needed to determine whether cannabinoid-related treatments improve such decision-making and function in people with BD.",

    "title": "Addressing insanity in paedophilic disorder: The need for a cognitive approach for forensic assessment to correctly identify idiopathic, acquired and iatrogenic forms.",
    "abstract": "Assessing insanity in individuals with paedophilic disorder presents unique challenges, particularly due to the diverse aetiologies of the condition, which lead to varying symptomatology and behavioural manifestations. To address this complexity, in this article we overview the characteristics of three variants of paedophilic disorder - idiopathic, acquired, and iatrogenic - and highlight the key obstacles in differentiating these forms, resulting in inconsistent and, at times, biased judicial outcomes. Through the analysis of three real-life case studies, we illustrate how forensic evaluations must go beyond a one-size-fits-all approach, integrating neuropsychological and neuroimaging assessment to provide more precise determinations of criminal responsibility. We therefore propose a cognitive model for the forensic assessment of insanity that emphasises the role of scientific evidence in distinguishing cases in which neurological conditions or medical treatments significantly impair volitional and cognitive capacities. In such cases, incarceration may be inappropriate, as incarceration hinders rehabilitation, while treatment in specialised non-custodial facilities could better address the underlying condition and reduce the risk of recidivism. In our analysis, we argue for the inclusion of a criterion in the DSM to ensure that the symptoms of paedophilic disorders are not due to substance effects or other medical conditions. Finally, we propose guidelines for forensic assessments of insanity in child sexual offences that support a multidisciplinary approach based on the cognitive model. In this framework, behavioural analysis, neuropsychological assessment, and (if necessary) neuroimaging techniques are combined to assess how the condition affects self-determination, ultimately leading to more accurate and scientifically informed legal decisions.",

    "title": "Community Pharmacy-Based Injectable Opioid Agonist Treatment: Findings From a Canadian Pilot Program.",
    "abstract": "Access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder remains limited, particularly for individuals who have not responded to oral opioid agonist treatment (OAT). A community pharmacy-based model of injectable OAT (iOAT) was piloted in Vancouver, Canada from March 2017 to December 2018. This brief report describes the program structure, participant sociodemographics, reported outcomes, and strengths and areas for improvement of the program. A retrospective review of cross-sectional, interviewer-led questionnaire data from participants who accessed iOAT at the pharmacy site (n\u2009=\u2009176) and provided informed consent was conducted. Outcomes include participant-reported changes in symptomatology, function and satisfaction, analysed through descriptive statistics. Open-ended responses were analysed using content analysis to identify strengths and areas for improvement of the program. Fifty-one participants (29%) completed the questionnaire, and most had multiple previous overdoses and trials of oral OAT. The most commonly reported outcomes were reduction in illicit opioid use (76%), opioid cravings (45%) and illicit substance use (45%). Participants identified key strengths of the program as positive experiences with staff and efficiency of the pharmacy model including flexible dosing time and the ability to pick up other medications at the same time. Suggested improvements focused on medication options (e.g., access to diacetylmorphine, alternate routes of administration), expanded hours and flexibility, additional support services, and increased capacity and space. Community pharmacy-based iOAT represents a novel strategy to expand access to evidence-based opioid use disorder treatment among individuals who inject opioids and have not responded to or do not prefer oral OAT.",

    "abstract": "For more than three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has provided a framework to quantify health loss due to diseases, injuries, and associated risk factors. This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions. The GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 375 diseases and injuries, and risk-attributable burden associated with 88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310\u2008000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120\u2008000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59\u2008000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100\u2008000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution. Total numbers of global DALYs grew 6\u00b71% (95% UI 4\u00b70-8\u00b71), from 2\u00b764 billion (2\u00b746-2\u00b786) in 2010 to 2\u00b780 billion (2\u00b757-3\u00b708) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12\u00b76% (11\u00b70-14\u00b71), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1\u00b745 billion (1\u00b731-1\u00b761) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1\u00b780 billion (1\u00b763-2\u00b703) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4\u00b71% (1\u00b79-6\u00b73) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90\u00b72 million [75\u00b72-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62\u00b78% [34\u00b70-107\u00b75]), depressive disorders (26\u00b73% [11\u00b76-42\u00b79]), and diabetes (14\u00b79% [7\u00b75-25\u00b76]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25\u00b78% (22\u00b76-28\u00b77) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49\u00b71% (32\u00b77-61\u00b70) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42\u00b79% (38\u00b70-48\u00b70) for HIV/AIDS, and 42\u00b72% (23\u00b76-56\u00b76) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16\u00b75% (10\u00b76-22\u00b70) and 24\u00b78% (7\u00b74-36\u00b77), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15\u00b76% (10\u00b77-19\u00b78) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1\u00b727 billion [1\u00b718-1\u00b738]) of the roughly 2\u00b780 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8\u00b74% (6\u00b79-10\u00b70) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30\u00b77% (24\u00b78-37\u00b73); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6\u00b77% (2\u00b70-11\u00b70) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54\u00b74% (38\u00b77-65\u00b73) for unsafe sanitation, 50\u00b75% (33\u00b73-63\u00b71) for unsafe water source, and 45\u00b72% (25\u00b76-72\u00b70) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44\u00b79% (37\u00b73-53\u00b75) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10\u00b75% [0\u00b71 to 20\u00b79]), drug use (8\u00b74% [2\u00b76 to 15\u00b73]), and high FPG (6\u00b72% [-2\u00b77 to 15\u00b76]; non-significant). Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage.

    "abstract": "To support the development of evidence-informed guidance for Canadian Kindergarten through Grade 12 (K-12) school administrators, this study examined their perceptions of the scope of student substance use and the challenges they face in responding within school settings. An online, cross-sectional survey collected data from 204 Canadian school administrators, capturing their experiences and perspectives on student substance use, including the types of challenges encountered, time spent addressing them, perceived capacity to respond, and differences across school levels (elementary, middle, and secondary). Responses from elementary/middle and secondary school administrators were compared in the analysis. Approximately 90% of administrators reported frequent student substance use challenges. The most common challenges were vaping (63.7%) and substance use on school property (41.7%). Secondary school administrators reported significantly more challenges and were more likely to spend in excess of 5 hours weekly addressing substance use. Most administrators reported a willingness to change practices (64.7%), but fewer felt equipped or effective in their current approaches. Student substance use poses a significant challenge for Canadian schools, particularly at the secondary level, increasing administrator workload. Administrators report feeling underprepared and insufficiently supported, despite a willingness to act. Findings highlight an urgent need for developmentally informed, evidence-aligned strategies and resources to support school-based responses to substance use and overall school health promotion.",

    "title": "The role of HAART in mitigating neurocognitive decline among HIV-positive Africans: Systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain a significant public health concern among people living with HIV (PWH) in Africa, despite the widespread implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). While HAART has been effective in reducing the incidence of severe neurocognitive disorder, milder forms of neurocognitive impairment continue to be observed even among individuals receiving active antiretroviral therapy. These subtle deficits, particularly prevalent in low-resource and low-literacy contexts, are associated with adverse outcomes such as diminished functional capacity, poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and reduced quality of life. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize the current evidence on the effectiveness of HAART on neurocognitive outcomes among HIV-positive individuals in Africa. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted across multiple electronic databases-including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, African Journals Online, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library-to identify primary research studies that examined the prevalence and clinical impact of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) among HIV-infected populations in Africa. Study selection and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers using predefined standardized protocols to ensure methodological rigor and minimize the risk of bias. The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251017353). This meta-analysis, which included 62 primary studies with a combined sample of 19,831 individuals living with HIV, estimated a pooled prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders was 47.18% (95% CI: 39.94%-54.42%). In contrast, among 2,176 HIV-negative individuals in the control group, the prevalence of neurocognitive disorder was 13.48% (95% CI: 10.9%-15.32%). Sub-regional stratification revealed the highest HAND prevalence in Eastern Africa (50.85%), followed by Southern Africa (48.12%) and Western Africa (43.67%), while Central Africa reported the lowest prevalence at 34.68%. Among individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), the prevalence of HAND was 46.96%, compared to 50.22% in ART-na\u00efve participants, indicating only a modest reduction in neurocognitive impairment associated with ART exposure. Meta-regression analyses identified several independent predictors significantly associated with increased odds of HAND, including advanced HIV disease stage (odds ratio [OR] 3.59; 95% CI: 2.81-4.59), lower educational attainment (3.13, 2.19-4.48), older age (2.05, 1.51-2.78), being female (2.18, 1.79-2.64), history of substance use (2.70, 2.65-2.75), reduced CD4+ T-cell counts (2.49, 1.42-4.36) and comorbid medical illness (2.05, 1.57-2.67). HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders affect nearly half of people living with HIV in Africa, despite the widespread availability of HAART, highlighting a critical unmet need in HIV care. While HAART reduces severe cognitive impairment, it offers limited protection against milder yet disabling forms, especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged and low-literacy populations. Contributing factors include advanced disease, low education, aging, being female, substance use, immune suppression and additional chronic medical illness. Integrating regular cognitive assessments, timely interventions, and culturally appropriate rehabilitation into HIV care is vital for enhancing clinical outcomes and quality of life.",

    "title": "Reducing Substance Use-Related Harms: A Simulation-Optimization Framework for the Design and Evaluation of Harm Reduction Vending Machines.",
    "abstract": "IntroductionThis study introduces a simulation-optimization framework designed to optimize the services of opioid-focused harm reduction vending machines (HRVMs). Given the rising rates of overdose deaths and increased potential for infectious diseases among persons who inject drugs (PWID), HRVMs can become an important harm reduction (HR) strategy by providing essential supplies that mitigate health risks.MethodsWe developed and validated an agent-based simulation-optimization framework to model the impact of HRVM-item allocation on the burden of opioid-related harms, accounting for demand dynamics, item restocking, and regional characteristics. The model evaluated health outcomes-cases of HIV, HCV, and fatal and nonfatal overdose-using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Scenario-based analyses were conducted for different HRVM configurations, considering current legal limits on safer-injection supplies, fentanyl's growing role as a drug of choice, and potential future policy changes.ResultsThe base scenario estimated optimal HRVM capacity allocation at approximately 48.5% fentanyl test strips (FTS), 26.2% naloxone, and 25.3% safer injection kits. However, sensitivity analyses showed significant variations based on fentanyl prevalence and willingness to use FTS. In scenarios of intentional fentanyl use with high FTS utilization, allocation favored FTS, while scenarios with low FTS utilization prioritized naloxone and injection kits. Adding addiction treatment referral services to HRVMs further reduced DALYs and societal costs, primarily by preventing fatal overdoses. Safer injection kits consistently reduced blood-borne infections compared with scenarios without these kits.ConclusionsThe framework could aid in HRVM\u00e3related service planning and evaluation, highlighting the importance of strategic inventory management and linkages to addiction care for enhanced health outcomes. HRVMs show potential as scalable, cost-effective HR interventions, warranting further research on their impact on service accessibility and health outcomes.HighlightsA novel simulation-optimization framework for designing and evaluating harm reduction vending machines (HRVMs) is presented.Optimal baseline allocation for products in the HRVMs included fentanyl test strips (48.5%), naloxone (26.2%), and safer injection kits (25.3%).Sensitivity analysis indicated optimal allocations vary substantially by local fentanyl prevalence and by individual harm reduction behaviors surrounding the use of fentanyl test strips.HRVM implementation reduces societal costs and disability-adjusted life-years associated with substance use-related harms.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven decision-making is an implementation strategy to improve system performance and health outcomes for individuals with substance use and mental health needs interacting with criminal-legal systems. We currently have limited understanding of how agencies define and use data in their decision-making processes. A qualitative study was conducted with agency leaders from jails, probation and parole, and community mental health and substance use service agencies to characterize (1) how respondents defined data and data use, (2) current level of data use for decision-making, (3) data capacity needs, and (4) agency perspectives on best practices and their recommendations. In-depth interviews were conducted with 68 mental health, substance use, jail, and probation leaders from a representative group of 52 U.S. counties from December 2020-March 2022. Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. Four themes emerged. For defining data and data use, respondents characterized their current level of data use as rudimentary. In terms of current level of data use, individual-level health or legal information needed to coordinate services, and risk prediction scores were used over system measures. Data capacity needs identified as capacity to track and share data across agencies and inadequate data management. In terms of best practices and agency recommendations, participants highlighted the need for data sharing, standardized data management systems, data dashboards, and in-house data expertise. Findings from this study highlight the limited capacity of counties to implement data-driven decision making in mental health, substance use, and criminal legal settings. Addressing gaps in infrastructure, staffing, and data expertise will require technical assistance and targeted policy incentives. System-level metrics and benchmarks, such as the cascade of care, are essential for evaluating cross-agency performance and improving outcomes for individuals with mental health needs.",

    "title": "Promoting Sustained Real-Life Benefits of Virtual Reality-Based Interventions in People With Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders: Qualitative Study.",
    "abstract": "Concurrent mental health and substance use disorders (MHD/SUD) are one of the most prominent public health problems as of today, and the worldwide prevalence of MHD/SUD is currently increasing. Modern virtual reality technology may provide easy, unlimited, and safe access to social experiences and interactions that hold the potential to promote individuals' new learning for the benefit of their social participation and recovery. However, the clinical adoption of virtual reality-based interventions (VRIs) is still in its infancy. Human limitations in skills transfer from virtual to actual reality are a major challenge in designing efficient VRIs. Key working mechanisms of the interactive, digital social environments in virtual realities have yet to be identified. There is a lack of knowledge on how immersive learning experiences may be designed and structured to promote sustained real-life benefits for people with mental health and substance use disorders. The main aims of this paper were to explain the factors affecting the outcomes of learning in multisensory virtual reality environments and to examine how they affect our particular target group. The overall purpose of this study was to understand how learning experiences in VRIs may be designed and orchestrated to promote sustained real-life benefits of VRIs in people with MHD/SUD. Eight individual in-depth interviews with adults in recovery from mental health and substance use disorders were conducted in a medium-sized municipality in eastern Norway in fall 2022. The interviews were analyzed using template analysis, a form of codebook thematic analysis, in a process involving peer researcher collaboration. This study suggests that the human capacity to achieve sustained learning outcomes from multisensory immersive learning experiences was limited in general. This study also indicates that people with mental health and substance use disorders struggle with attention deficit, concentration, and memory to an extent that it affects their daily functioning. Altogether, the theoretical framework and empirical findings provide added information on how we may develop learning experience designs in VRIs that accommodate human perceptual processes. VRI scenarios that may be repeated and structured according to individual learning prerequisites may enable the restructuring of maladaptive social schema. This may possibly promote the storage of new, repaired schemas in the user's long-term memory. It is therefore suggested that short, focused VRI scenarios, orchestrated in a sequenced and deliberately structured learning workflow, may promote sustained real-life benefits from VRIs in people with mental health and substance use disorders.",

    "title": "Patching holes and bridging gaps: Implementing Law Enforcement-Assisted Diversion (LEAD) in resource-scarce environments.",
    "abstract": "Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) is a pre-arrest diversion program that allows police officers to refer individuals to LEAD's harm reduction case management services in lieu of arrest for most low-level, non-violent criminalized behaviors. The program assesses participants' needs for resources and services and facilitates referrals and ongoing support to meet these needs. In this qualitative study, we examine the influence of service availability and accessibility on the implementation of North Carolina's LEAD programs. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 49 participants across four well-established LEAD sites, including LEAD partners (n\u00a0=\u00a027) and LEAD participants (n\u00a0=\u00a022). We analyzed the data using a blended inductive/deductive coding strategy. Participants' narratives highlighted several important challenges related to service provision and linkage in communities with a dearth of service options. Findings were captured in four main themes. First, in some communities, certain resources and services were completely unavailable. Second, even when community-based resources and services were available, they were often perceived as inaccessible by participants for a variety of reasons. Third, LEAD programs and staff worked intensely and flexibly to increase access to community-based resources and services. Finally, there was widespread agreement that resource scarcity disrupted the continuum of care, thereby causing some participants to disengage from LEAD and related services as their readiness for change fluctuated. The efficacy of diversion programs, including LEAD, depends not only on their high-quality implementation and fidelity to existing models, but also on successful coordination and linkage to a range of comprehensive, easily accessible and sustainable community-based resources and services. When community-based resources are unable to meet basic needs and support the continuum of care for people with substance use disorders, LEAD staff and participants will struggle to meet expectations and programs will be unlikely to optimize outcomes.",

    "title": "Integrating an exercise program into opioid agonist therapy: a pilot study on feasibility, fitness improvements, and participation challenges.",
    "abstract": "People receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT) face high risk of comorbidities, including cardiovascular and mental health disorders. Integrating exercise programs with OAT may reduce health disparities and improve well-being. This study explored the feasibility and preliminary effects of an integrated exercise program. This multicentre, mixed-methods pilot study was conducted in Western Norway, recruiting 22 participants receiving OAT from three outpatient clinics. The six-week, group-based exercise program focused on high-intensity endurance and strength training. Changes in aerobic fitness (4-minut step test), psychological distress (10-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist, SCL-10), fatigue (3-items Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS-3), lung function (spirometry), and respiratory symptoms (modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, mMRC) were assessed, while qualitative interviews provided insights into intervention feasibility. Pre- and post-test assessments indicated improvements in aerobic fitness, as measured by the 4-minute step test, with a pre-test mean of 89.4 (SD: 24.7) and a post-test mean of 103.1 (SD: 31.3) step-cycles, despite a modest attendance rate of 28%. Psychological distress, evaluated using the SCL-10, increased in score from 1.85 (SD: 0.66) to 2.03 (SD: 0.59). Fatigue also increased slightly Fss-3: 4.44 (SD:2.38) to 5.07 (SD:2.01), while respiratory symptoms using mMRC, lung capacity with FVC, and expiratory volume FEV1 remained stable. Qualitative findings were categorized into three main themes: (1) The clinic as an arena for physical activity, (2) a modest move with a substantial benefit for participants, (3) challenges and adjustments to the intervention. Participants reported that exercising in connection with the OAT clinic promoted a sense of care and support from clinicians. Many experienced increased self-confidence and social engagement, though attendance was affected by health issues, fluctuating motivation, and logistical challenges. This pilot study suggests that integrating structured exercise into OAT can be feasible and improve aerobic fitness. However, increased psychological distress and fatigue might indicate the need for additional support. The low attendance rate highlights engagement challenges, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies to enhance participation. Future research should focus on optimizing intervention design to improve attendance and enhance physical and psychological outcomes for individuals in OAT.",

It is unknown whether provision of harm reduction services within a transitional housing environment affects treatment uptake, drug supply, or drug using behaviors. This study focused on mitigation of the impacts of mass relocation and uptake of services by residents of harm reduction housing (HRH) to generate novel insights on individual drug use, social cohesion, collective efficacy, and health outcomes resulting from HRH. We used a mixed-methods study leveraging our prior Rapid Assessment of Consumer Knowledge findings and ongoing drug checking capacity to gather data on response to rapid rehousing in Boston's \"Mass and Cass\" neighborhood. First, we developed an inventory of harm reduction services offered and accessible to HRH residents to sufficiently measure exposure. Second, we launched an observational cohort following 106 HRH residents at 2 time periods over 12\u2009months. Finally, we invited a subset of 28 cohort members to take part in repeated, longitudinal one-on-one interviews to gain greater insight into HRH, development of social cohesion and collective efficacy, and drug-related outcomes. Protocol adaptations due to housing shifts, over policing, and serendipity were applied.",

    "abstract": "To examine determinants of evidence-based, nonpharmacologic treatments for chronic pain among patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) using an access to care lens. Convenience sample of respondents to an online survey directed to rehabilitation professionals. Civilian and VA-based centers with TBI providers. US based providers (N=145) (63% civilian; 34% VA, 3% DOD). Not applicable. A 10-item survey examining barriers to nonpharmacologic evidence-based therapies, informed by the robust Levesque Access to Care framework, which includes supply and demand characteristics. Six of the items described patient and community abilities to access care and 4 focused on health care system or infrastructure critical in access. On the basis of their professional experience, participants were asked to separately rate the frequency of the 10 barriers for each of the 3 specific guideline-endorsed interventions for chronic pain: behavioral health therapies, comprehensive chronic pain programs, and substance use disorder treatment. Across all 3 interventions, morbidity associated with TBI (ie, cognitive, physical disabilities), patient lack of understanding, trust, or beliefs about efficacy of intervention, and lack of qualified providers who can deliver the intervention were the most frequently endorsed barriers to delivering NP-EBTs for chronic pain. Subgroup analyses found higher frequency of barriers in civilian versus VA settings particularly related to patient ability to afford (58%-70% difference) and insurance coverage (54%-61%) of interventions. Findings have implication for policy and practice to address health care inequities that persons with TBI-related disability experience in accessing high-quality, evidence-based treatments.",

    "abstract": "AIMS\nThis meta-analysis reviewed 15 clinical trials (18 study sites/arms), examining the efficacy of an integrated cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBI) delivered to individuals with an alcohol or other drug use disorder and a co-occurring mental health disorder (AOD/MHD). Outcomes were alcohol or other drug use and mental health symptoms at post-treatment through follow-up.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe inverse-variance weighted effect size was calculated for each study and pooled under random effects assumptions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIntegrated CBI showed a small effect size for AOD (g\u00a0=\u00a00.188, P\u00a0=\u00a00.061; I2\u00a0=\u00a086%, \u03c42\u00a0=\u00a00.126, k\u00a0=\u00a018) and MHD (g\u00a0=\u00a00.169, P\u00a0=\u00a00.024; I2\u00a0=\u00a058%, \u03c42\u00a0=\u00a00.052, k\u00a0=\u00a018) outcomes, although only MHD outcomes were statistically significant. Analysis by subgroup suggested that effect magnitude varied by type of contrast condition (integrated CBI\u00a0+\u00a0usual care vs. usual care only; integrated CBI vs. a single-disorder intervention), follow-up time point (post-treatment vs. 3-6\u00a0months) and primary AOD/MHD diagnosis, although these sub-groups often contained significant residual heterogeneity. In a series of mixed effects, meta-regression models, demographic factors were non-significant predictors of between-study heterogeneity. For AOD outcomes, greater effects were observed in higher quality studies, but study quality was not related to effect size variability for MHD outcomes.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe current meta-analysis shows a small and variable effect for integrated CBI with the most promising effect sizes observed for integrated CBI compared with a single disorder intervention (typically an AOD-only intervention) for follow-up outcomes, and for interventions targeting alcohol use and/or post-traumatic stress disorder. Given the clinical and methodological variability within the sample, results should be considered a preliminary, but important step forward in our understanding of treatment for co-occurring AOD/MHD.",

In order to describe the quantity and quality of current evidence, we conducted an evidence gap map provides a visual overview, highlighting areas lacking evidence. Methods: According to developed inclusion and exclusion criteria, a systematic literature search was conducted to find related systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS and Cochrane were searched using search strings from 2000 until 2021. Characteristics of the included reviews were extracted and summarized. Two persons evaluated methodological quality independently using the AMSTAR tool. Invite a third person to solve any discrepancies. Results: This study revealed seven systematic reviews, including one meta-analysis. One study was of high quality, four of medium, and two of low quality. A total of 272 primary studies were included with a median value of 38.8 (range, 6\u2013106) which deeply analyzed for data extraction. Cross-sectional, case-control, and qualitative case studies were the most used study designs. Diarrheal diseases were the most reported outcomes representing 46% of the impact evaluations. Cholera outbreaks account for 43% of a crisis context. The research gaps were insufficient reporting of some interventions with related outcomes and the geographical distribution of current evidence.

    "title": "Effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions on health outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease: A meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Recently, the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based intervention on health outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) has been recognized in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but no comprehensive systematic review has been conducted. To address this research gap, our study aimed to evaluate whether comprehensive CBT-based interventions positively affect health outcomes in CHD patients. It was hypothesized that CBT-based interventions are effective in: (1) Reducing depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms; (2) Reducing body mass index, blood pressure, and lipid levels; and (3) Improving quality of life, and exercise endurance. AIM To verify the effectiveness of CBT-based interventions on CHD patients through a meta-analysis of previous publications. METHODS Relevant RCTs published in English were obtained by searching electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Proquest, with the retrieval time from inception to August 2020. The primary outcomes were psychological factors (depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms), physiological factors (body mass index, blood pressure, blood lipids). The secondary outcomes included quality of life and exercise endurance. We used Review Manager 5.3 to conduct the meta-analysis and used the Physiotherapy Evidence Database tool to evaluate the quality of studies. RESULTS A total of 22 RCTs comprising 4991 patients with CHD were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The main analysis revealed that CBT-based intervention can reduce depression symptoms: -2.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): -2.83 to -1.16, P < 0.001]; anxiety symptoms: -2.07 (95%CI: -3.39 to -0.75, P = 0.002); stress symptoms: -3.33 (95%CI: -4.23 to -2.44, P < 0.001); body mass index: -0.47 (95%CI: -0.81 to -0.13, P = 0.006); and improve physical functioning: 3.36 (95%CI: 1.63 to 5.10, P = 0.000) and mental functioning: 6.91 (95%CI: 4.10 to 9.73, P < 0.001). Moreover, subgroup analysis results showed that CBT-based interventions were more effective for symptoms of depression and anxiety in CHD patients when individual, as opposed to group treatment, and psycho-education, behavioral and cognitive strategies were applied as the core treatment approaches. CONCLUSION CBT-based interventions are effective treatment strategies for CHD patients, significantly improving their symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, body mass index, and health-related quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Objective : e-Health or web-based systems in the field of tinnitus have gained increasing interest. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered via the internet is currently witnessing a surge in both attention and offerings. This systematic review analyzed the efficacy and sustainability of internet-based therapies aimed at reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. The review exclusively considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which trained personnel were actively involved during intervention. Methods : Utilizing search terms such as tinnitus, internet-based therapy, and e-Health therapy, we identified 155 studies, from which 37 RCTs were carefully examined for data availability. Primary outcome measures included treatment effects for tinnitus distress (Tinnitus Questionnaire and other questionnaires) and handicap (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory), while secondary outcomes encompassed depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. Meta-analyses were conducted employing random-effect models. A study effect model was applied, yielding a singular effect size for each sample. The effect sizes were examined for influences of various moderators. Results : We found a statistically significant large effect size for improvement in tinnitus distress (d = 0.83; [confidence interval 0.61\u20131.06] with total n = 450 for the experimental group and total n = 504 or the controls), while the reduction of tinnitus handicap was smaller (moderate effect size d = 0.59; [0.44\u20130.73]). Less strong but still significant effects resulted for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Most of the long-term outcomes remained stable. As moderators, the risk of bias (RoB) and the severity of tinnitus manifestations were identified. Conclusions : Internet-based therapy provides a valuable avenue for initial therapeutic contact, as supporting component in tinnitus treatment if accompanied by therapists. The heterogeneous quality with high drop-out rates or partly high RoB and the wide range of interventions (counseling, eCBT, mindfulness) might be considered as a limiting factor for a first-line management in tinnitus. So far, the use of e-Health is dependent on availability or user preferences.",

Practice recommendations for each outcome were graded per NHMRC body-of-evidence guidelines.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWeight-neutral approaches resulted in greater improvement in bulimia (P\u2009=\u20090.02), but no significant differences were observed for any other outcome. Weight-neutral approaches may be as effective as weight-loss methods for improving physical, psychological, and behavioral outcomes. Limitations include inconsistent definitions of both approaches and variable time frames of follow-up.",

    "title": "Does nature-based social prescription improve mental health outcomes? A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background A nature-based social prescription (NBSP) is an approach to improving mental health outcomes that involves prescribing nature-based interventions as complementary or alternative therapy to traditional ones. A variety of advantages are available from NBSP for people looking to enhance their mental well-being. The effect size of the nature-based social prescriptions (NBSPs) has not been thoroughly evaluated by systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Objectives The current study aimed to analyze existing studies and conduct a meta-analysis to determine the overall effect size of the nature-based social prescriptions (NBSP\u2019s) outcomes on mental health. Methods By choosing the relevant papers from among those that were available, a meta-analysis was carried out in the current study. A systematic search of electronic databases (Pub Med, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychINFO) was conducted to identify relevant studies. Studies were included if they evaluated the effects of NBSP on mental health outcomes. Effect sizes were calculated using the random effects model. Results Meta-analysis of interventions statistics shows that CBT (SMD \u22120.0035; 95% CI: [\u22120.5090; 0.5020]; Tau^2: 0.1011; Tau: 0.318), digital intervention (SMD \u22120.3654; 95% CI: [\u22120.5258; 1.2566]; Tau^2: 0.2976, Tau: 0.5455), music intervention (SMD \u22122.1281; 95% CI: [\u22120.4659; 4.7221]; Tau^2: 3.4046; Tau:1.8452), and psychological interventions (SMD \u22120.8529; 95% CI: [0.3051; 1.4007]; Tau^2: 0.1224; Tau: 0.3499) do not significantly impact. The other interventions [social belongingness, communication training, blue intervention, nature-based education, cognitive behavior group therapy (CBGT), social prescribing coordinator, self-help intervention, participatory, organizational intervention, inpatient services, brief diet, internet-based intervention, prenatal intervention, yoga and meditation, ergonomics training program, yoga nidra intervention, and storytelling] highlighted above are significant. Conclusion The conclusion of the meta-analysis supports the idea that incorporating nature-based social prescription interventions into mental healthcare plans can effectively complement traditional therapies and improve mental health outcomes.

    "abstract": "Self-regulated learning (SRL) plays a pivotal role in medical education. There is a pressing need for a meta-analytical review to comprehensively evaluate the effect sizes of SRL strategies across diverse learning outcomes and levels of medical trainees. A meta-analysis was executed by searching five databases and resulted in 61 studies that met our inclusion criteria. A three-level meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between SRL strategies and various levels of learning outcomes (i.e., affective, cognitive, and behavioral learning outcomes). Moderator analyses were conducted using meta-regression, considering factors such as types of learning outcomes, training levels, SRL subscales, and quality of the studies. The analysis yielded an average effect size of .212, using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient, demonstrating a positive and significant association between SRL strategies and overall learning outcomes. Although our moderator analyses indicated that SRL subscales and study quality did not significantly influence the relationship between SRL strategies and learning outcomes, SRL strategies had a more pronounced effect on affective outcomes than on test scores, behavioral outcomes, and mental health outcomes. In addition, the association between SRL strategies and learning outcomes were significantly higher among the clerkship phase of undergraduate medical education than the pre-clerkship phase.",

    "title": "Project Harmony: A Meta-Analysis With Individual Patient Data on Behavioral and Pharmacologic Trials for Comorbid Posttraumatic Stress and Alcohol or Other Drug Use Disorders.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTreatment efficacy for co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders is well established, yet direct evidence for comparative effectiveness across treatments is lacking. The present study compared the effectiveness of several behavioral and pharmacological therapies for adults with co-occurring PTSD and alcohol or other drug use disorders.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted through December 2020 for trials targeting PTSD, alcohol or other drug use disorders, or both disorders (36 studies, N=4,046). Primary outcomes were severity scores for PTSD, alcohol use, and drug use, estimated via moderated nonlinear factor analysis. Propensity score weight-adjusted multilevel models were used. Model-predicted effect sizes were estimated for each treatment, and comparative effect sizes for each active arm against treatment as usual, at end of treatment and at 12-month follow-up.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared with treatment as usual, combining trauma-focused therapy and pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders showed the largest comparative effect sizes for PTSD severity (d=-0.92, 95% CI=-1.57, -0.30) and alcohol use severity (d=-1.10, 95% CI=-1.54, -0.68) at end of treatment. Other treatments with large comparative effect sizes included pharmacotherapies for alcohol or other drug use disorders, trauma-focused integrated therapies, and trauma-focused nonintegrated therapies. Reductions in outcomes for PTSD symptoms and alcohol use were observed for nearly all treatments.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings provide support for treating comorbid PTSD and substance use disorders using a variety of approaches, with alcohol-targeted pharmacotherapies and trauma-focused behavioral therapies as a combination of treatments that lead to early and sustained improvements in PTSD and alcohol use severity. Further treatment development is indicated for combining behavioral and pharmacological treatments for synergized impact and understanding the mechanisms of action and conditions under which each treatment type is optimized.",

    "title": "Efficacy of eHealth Versus In-Person Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Equivalence.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nInsomnia is a prevalent condition with significant health, societal, and economic impacts. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is recommended as the first-line treatment. With limited accessibility to in-person-delivered CBTI (ipCBTI), electronically delivered eHealth CBTI (eCBTI), ranging from telephone- and videoconference-delivered interventions to fully automated web-based programs and mobile apps, has emerged as an alternative. However, the relative efficacy of eCBTI compared to ipCBTI has not been conclusively determined.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to test the comparability of eCBTI and ipCBTI through a systematic review and meta-analysis of equivalence based on randomized controlled trials directly comparing the 2 delivery formats.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA comprehensive search across multiple databases was conducted, leading to the identification and analysis of 15 unique randomized head-to-head comparisons of ipCBTI and eCBTI. Data on sleep and nonsleep outcomes were extracted and subjected to both conventional meta-analytical methods and equivalence testing based on predetermined equivalence margins derived from previously suggested minimal important differences. Supplementary Bayesian analyses were conducted to determine the strength of the available evidence.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe meta-analysis included 15 studies with a total of 1083 participants. Conventional comparisons generally favored ipCBTI. However, the effect sizes were small, and the 2 delivery formats were statistically significantly equivalent (P<.05) for most sleep and nonsleep outcomes. Additional within-group analyses showed that both formats led to statistically significant improvements (P<.05) in insomnia severity; sleep quality; and secondary outcomes such as fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Heterogeneity analyses highlighted the role of treatment duration and dropout rates as potential moderators of the differences in treatment efficacy.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\neCBTI and ipCBTI were found to be statistically significantly equivalent for treating insomnia for most examined outcomes, indicating eCBTI as a clinically relevant alternative to ipCBTI. This supports the expansion of eCBTI as a viable option to increase accessibility to effective insomnia treatment. Nonetheless, further research is needed to address the limitations noted, including the high risk of bias in some studies and the potential impact of treatment duration and dropout rates on efficacy.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION\nPROSPERO CRD42023390811; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=390811.",

    "abstract": "Unfavourable changes occur in children\u2019s health behaviours and outcomes during the summer holidays. This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of summer holiday programs in mitigating these changes. Six databases (MEDLINE, JBI, PsychINFO, Embase, ERIC and Scopus) were systematically searched for experimental controlled studies that investigated programs of at least 5 days\u2019 duration conducted exclusively during the summer holiday period on school-aged children (5\u201318 years). Primary outcomes were moderate-vigorous physical activity and energy intake. Secondary outcomes were sedentary behavior, diet quality, adiposity, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Risk of Bias was assessed using the PEDro tool. Effect sizes were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis with narrative synthesis of effects by student or program characteristics. Ten studies (two randomised controlled trials, and eight non-randomised controlled trials) involving 1,446 participants were included. Summer programs had a significant moderate effect on reducing sedentary behaviour (g= -0.59, 95%CI= -1.16, -0.03) and significant small effects on improving moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (g\u2009=\u20090.35, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.67) and adiposity (g= -0.25, 95% CI = -0.39, -0.10). No significant change was detected for cardiorespiratory fitness (g\u2009=\u20090.43, 95%CI= -0.32, 1.17), energy intake (g= -0.06, 95% CI -2.33, 2.22), or diet quality (g\u2009=\u20090.20, 95%CI= -0.43, 0.83). Summer program effectiveness did not appear to differ by child sociodemographic or program characteristics. Concerns regarding bias and high heterogeneity impacted results. Summer programs show potential in promoting healthier movement behaviours in children and supporting healthy body weight during the summer months. Although evidence from the included studies has limitations, these programs produced small to moderate effect sizes and present promising health intervention opportunities for children. Future research with more rigorous study designs and comprehensive reporting is needed to confirm these findings and better understand the impact of summer programs on children\u2019s health.

    "title": "Challenge of ending TB in China: tuberculosis control in primary healthcare sectors under integrated TB control model\u2013a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "China has the third-largest burden of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the world with great challenges towards ending TB. Primary health care (PHC) sectors play a critical role in TB prevention and control in communities under the Chinese integrated TB control model. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review of research evidence on TB control in PHC sectors under the integrated TB control model in China. This review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published from 2012 to January 2022 were searched from four international and three Chinese databases. Studies conducted inside mainland China and relevant with TB control service in PHC sectors under the integrated model were included. After study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, the meta-analysis was performed with RevMan using a random-effect model.When I2 was more than 50%, subgroup analysis was performed to explore possible reasons for heterogeneity. We also conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis for outcomes after meta-analysis by exclusion of studies with a high risk of bias or classified as low quality. Forty-three studies from 16 provinces/municipalities in China were included in this review, and most studies included were of medium quality. PHC sectors in East China delivered TB control service better overall than that in West China, especially in tracing of patients and TB case management (TCM). In meta-analyses, both the pooled arrival rate of tracing and pooled TCM rate in East China were higher than those in West China. TB patients had a low degree of willingness to receive TCM provided by healthcare workers in PHC sectors nationwide, especially among migrant TB patients. There were 9 studies reporting factors related to TB control service in PHC sectors, 6 (2 in East and 4 in West China) of which indentified several characteristics of patients as associated factors. The context of PHC sectors was demonstrated to influence delivery of TB control service in PHC sectors in 5 studies (3 in East, 1 in Middle and 1 in West China). Most studies on strategies to promoting TB control services in PHC sectors were conducted in East China and some of these studies identified several online and offline interventions and strategies improving patients\u2019 treatment compliance [pooled OR (95% CI): 7.81 (3.08, 19.19] and awareness of TB [pooled OR (95% CI): 6.86 (2.16, 21.72)]. It is of urgent need to improve TB control in PHC sector in China, particularly in West China. Formative and implementation research with rigorous design are necessary to develop comprehensive, context-specific, and patient-centered TB control strategies to promote ending TB in China.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Psychosocial intervention is imperative for treating alcohol use disorder (AUD), but there is no comprehensive evidence regarding its effectiveness. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in treating AUD amongadolescents and young adults. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles were searched from EMBASE, PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Also, articles were retrieved from gray literature. The quality of articles has been assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment. Results A total of 12 randomized controlled trials were included. Integrated family and CBT, CBT, guided self-change, and ecologically based family therapy had a mild effect in reducing alcohol use frequency. On the other hand, integrated motivational enhancement therapy and CBT (\u22120.71 [95% CI: \u22120.97, \u22120.45]) and common elements treatment approaches (4.5 [95% CI: 6.9, 2.2]) had the highest effect size for reducing alcohol use frequency and amount, respectively. In conclusion, most of the interventions had no significant effect on different drinking outcomes. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of combined interventions surpassed that of the single interventions. The effect of psychosocial interventions on abstinence was inconclusive. Therefore, future studies will explore alternative, newly emerged third-wave therapeutic approaches.

    "title": "Quantifying the fatal and non-fatal burden of disease associated with child growth failure, 2000-2023: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.",
    "abstract": "Child growth failure (CGF), which includes underweight, wasting, and stunting, is among the factors most strongly associated with mortality and morbidity in children younger than 5 years worldwide. Poor height and bodyweight gain arise from a variety of biological and sociodemographic factors and are associated with increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. We used data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 to estimate CGF prevalence, the risk of infectious diseases associated with CGF, and the disease mortality, morbidity, and overall burden associated with CGF. In this analysis we estimated the all-cause and cause-specific (diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infections, malaria, and measles) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost and mortality associated with stunting, wasting, underweight, and CGF in aggregate. We combined the burden associated with mild, moderate, and severe forms of CGF: stunting was defined as height-for-age Z scores (HAZ) less than -1, underweight was defined as weight-for-age Z scores (WAZ) less than -1, and wasting was defined as weight-for-height Z scores (WHZ) less than -1, according to WHO Child Growth Standards. Population-level continuous distributions of HAZ, WAZ, and WHZ were estimated for 2000 to 2023 using data from surveys, literature, and individual-level study data. The risk of incidence of, and mortality due to, diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, malaria, and measles was separately estimated in a meta-regression framework from longitudinal cohort data for Z scores less than -1. Finally, fatal outcomes associated with these diseases were estimated with vital registration, verbal autopsy, and case-fatality data, while non-fatal outcomes were estimated with surveys as well as health-care utilisation and case reporting data. The exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates were from continuous distributions, allowing for direct assessment of the attributable fractions for mild, moderate, and severe stunting, underweight, wasting, and the combined impact of child growth failure within populations. All estimates were age-specific, sex-specific, geography-specific, and year-specific. We estimated that, in children younger than 5 years in 2023, CGF was associated with 79\u00b74 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 47\u00b70-106) DALYs lost and 880\u2008000 (517\u2008000-1\u2008170\u2008000) deaths. This represented 17\u00b79% (10\u00b76-23\u00b78) of 444 million (434-457) total under-5 DALYs and 18\u00b78% (11\u00b71-25\u00b70) of all 4\u00b767 million (4\u00b759-4\u00b775) under-5 deaths. Compared to stunting (33\u00b70 million [24\u00b71-42\u00b72] DALYs, 373\u2008000 [272\u2008000-477\u2008000] deaths) and wasting (39\u00b72 million [23\u00b78-53\u00b70] DALYs, 428\u2008000 [256\u2008000-583\u2008000] deaths), childhood underweight was associated with the largest share of CGF-related disease burden: 52\u00b72 million (21\u00b79-75\u00b71) DALYs and 573\u2008000 (236\u2008000-824\u2008000) deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2023. CGF remains a leading factor associated with death and disability in children younger than 5 years, despite global attention and focused interventions to reduce the prevalence of associated CGF indicators. Our findings underscore the need for policies, strategies, and interventions that focus on all indicators of CGF to reduce its associated health burden. Gates Foundation.",

    "title": "Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation.",
    "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (EC) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating a liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if EC can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review update was conducted as part of a living systematic review. To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of EC for helping people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 March 2025, reference-checked, and contacted study authors. We included trials randomising people who smoked to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies where all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to measure an eligible outcome. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer-term EC use. We used the RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias for each study and GRADE to assess evidence certainty. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Where appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences with 95% CIs. We included 104 completed studies (14 new to this update), representing 30,366 participants, of which 61 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We rated 11 included studies as being at low risk of bias, 70 at high risk (including all non-randomised studies), and the remainder at unclear risk overall. Nicotine EC result in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high-certainty evidence) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.88; I\u00b2 = 0%; 9 studies, 2703 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37; I\u00b2 = 58%; 7 studies, 2241 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.03; I\u00b2 = 30%; 8 studies, 2950 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nicotine EC probably result in increased quit rates compared to non-nicotine EC (moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70; I\u00b2 = 0%; 7 studies, 1918 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 4 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate-certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; I\u00b2 = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; I\u00b2 = 0%; 10 studies, 1717 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to behavioural support only or no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomised to nicotine EC (low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.25; I\u00b2 = 13%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs may be more common in people randomised to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.55; I\u00b2 = 66%; 8 studies, 2485 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain and, again, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.29; I\u00b2 = 0%; 15 studies, 4716 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Data from non-randomised studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit. There is high-certainty evidence that nicotine EC increase quit rates compared to NRT, and moderate-certainty evidence that they probably increase quit rates compared to EC without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with behavioural support or no support also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study designs. CIs were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence of a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine EC nor between nicotine EC and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger trials are needed to fully evaluate safety. Included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision for some comparisons and for safety outcomes due to the relatively small number of RCTs contributing, often with low event rates.

    "abstract": "Serotonergic psychedelics and 3,4-methylendioxtmethamphetamine (MDMA) are promising treatments for mental disorders with a continuously evolving evidence base. We searched Pubmed/Scopus/clinical trial registries up to 08july2025 for double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing MDMA or serotonergic psychedelics in patients with mental disorders. Primary outcomes were change in disease-specific symptoms and all-cause discontinuation. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and relative risk (RR) were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed with Cochrane's RoB-tool version 2 and certainty of evidence with GRADE. The review is maintained as living systematic review (https://ebipsyche-database.org/).

    "title": "Oral nicotine pouches for cessation or reduction of use of other tobacco or nicotine products.",
    "abstract": "Oral nicotine pouches (ONP) emerged in the late 2000s, but have gained popularity since their introduction to the global market in 2016, with claims about their harm reduction potential. Primary objectives \u2022 To evaluate the benefits and harms of ONP when used to help people transition away from combustible tobacco use (smoking). \u2022 To evaluate the impact of ONP on the prevalence of combustible tobacco use. Secondary objectives \u2022 To evaluate the benefits and harms of ONP when used to help people transition away from other non-combustible tobacco/commercial nicotine product use. \u2022 To evaluate the impact of ONP on the prevalence of use of other non-combustible tobacco/commercial nicotine products. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO from 2000 to 13 January 2025. We also covered ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP through our search of CENTRAL. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ONP in people using tobacco or other non-combustible tobacco/non-pharmaceutical nicotine products. RCTs must have reported tobacco/nicotine use at 4+ weeks or biomarkers or adverse events at 1+ weeks. We also sought interrupted/multiple time-series studies of ONP's population-level effects on the prevalence of use of other tobacco/nicotine products. Our critical outcomes were: smoking abstinence at 4+ weeks; number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) at 1+ weeks; and change in the prevalence of smoking. Important outcomes included tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), metals, and inflammatory markers detected in human biosamples. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias. We synthesised results using random-effects meta-analysis where possible. We used I We included four small studies (n < 150 for each, total n = 284; 3 independent, 1 industry-funded; 3 at high risk of bias and 1 at unclear risk of bias). All were RCTs in people who smoked combustible cigarettes at baseline. Three were conducted in the USA, and one in New Zealand. Two compared higher- versus lower-nicotine dose ONP. Two compared ONP to instructions to continue smoking as usual. One each compared ONP to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), snus, and pharmaceutical nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Smoking abstinence Smoking abstinence may be slightly higher in people randomised to ONP compared to no intervention at eight-week follow-up (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.32; 1 study, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence (risk of bias and imprecision; CI incorporated possibility of no difference)), but the evidence is very uncertain. Low-certainty evidence (serious imprecision; CI incorporated possibility of no difference) suggests there may be lower abstinence rates in those randomised to ONP compared to e-cigarettes (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.02; 1 study, 36 participants). Evidence from one study (n = 30) comparing higher- versus lower-dose ONP found a higher quit rate in the higher-dose arm, but again with wide CI encompassing the possibility of no difference and of higher quit rates in the lower-dose arm (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.26 to 96.13; evidence certainty not assessed). Serious adverse events No SAEs occurred in the three studies reporting this outcome. Data were available for the comparisons ONP versus minimal control (2 studies, 124 participants; very low-certainty evidence (risk of bias and serious imprecision)) and ONP versus e-cigarettes (1 study, 26 participants; low-certainty evidence (serious imprecision)). TSNA One study reported on a TSNA (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL)) comparing ONP with instructions to continue smoking. There may be lower levels with ONP (MD -265.30 ng/g creatinine, 95% CI -350.64 to -179.96; 53 participants; very low-certainty evidence (risk of bias and imprecision)), but the evidence is very uncertain. Data from two studies suggested no difference in NNAL levels between higher- and lower-dose ONP (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -1.87 to 1.56; I There is limited evidence on the use of ONP for cessation or reduction of cigarette use. There is no evidence on the use of ONP for cessation or reduction of other tobacco or nicotine products or on the effects of ONP on prevalence of tobacco use/nicotine vaping. Low-certainty evidence suggests that people randomised to ONP may be slightly less likely to quit smoking than those randomised to e-cigarettes, but data were from one small study and therefore imprecise. Limited, short-term data did not identify any serious health harms from ONP when used to help people transition away from tobacco smoking. More research on the effects of ONP for cessation or reduction of use of other tobacco or non-pharmaceutical nicotine products is urgently needed. Future trials should prioritise comparing ONP to other active interventions (e.g. NRT and e-cigarettes).

    "abstract": "The prevalence and negative sequelae of co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder (PTSD + SUD) are well documented. Findings from evidence syntheses regarding which PTSD + SUD treatments work best overall have been mixed, potentially because these treatments are not equally effective for all PTSD + SUD patient subgroups. Epidemiological and qualitative research suggest that veteran status may be related to differential PTSD + SUD treatment response. This study, applying recent quantitative methodological advances in evidence synthesis, is the first to examine the potential moderating effect of veteran status on PTSD + SUD treatment outcome. We report secondary analyses of psychotherapy arm data ( Tests of causally moderated comparative effectiveness showed that trauma-focused psychotherapy targeting PTSD and integrated trauma-focused psychotherapy targeting PTSD and SUD were both superior to treatment as usual for alcohol use severity outcomes, and this effect was stronger for veterans than civilians. Analyses did not provide evidence for differential response to active PTSD + SUD psychotherapies, relative to treatment as usual, on PTSD or drug use severity outcomes as a function of veteran status. Findings lend support for delivering trauma-focused psychotherapies to patients with PTSD + SUD, especially veterans, and point to important future directions for inquiries into optimizing patient matching to PTSD + SUD treatment.

    "title": "Global age-sex-specific all-cause mortality and life expectancy estimates for 204 countries and territories and 660 subnational locations, 1950-2023: a demographic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.",
    "abstract": "Comprehensive, comparable, and timely estimates of demographic metrics-including life expectancy and age-specific mortality-are essential for evaluating, understanding, and addressing trends in population health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time. We used 24\u2008025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. In 2023, 60\u00b71 million (95% UI 59\u00b70-61\u00b71) deaths occurred globally, of which 4\u00b767 million (4\u00b759-4\u00b775) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35\u00b72% (32\u00b72-38\u00b74) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66\u00b76% (65\u00b78-67\u00b73). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67\u00b77% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11\u00b75%, 31\u00b77%, and 49\u00b79%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53\u00b79% and 40\u00b71%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87\u00b73% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61\u00b72% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13\u00b72% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51\u00b72 (50\u00b76-51\u00b77) years for females and 47\u00b79 (47\u00b74-48\u00b74) years for males in 1950 to 76\u00b73 (76\u00b72-76\u00b74) years for females and 71\u00b74 (71\u00b73-71\u00b75) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74\u00b77 (74\u00b76-74\u00b78) years for females and 69\u00b73 (69\u00b72-69\u00b74) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76\u00b73 [76\u00b70-76\u00b76] years for females and 71\u00b75 [71\u00b72-71\u00b78] years for males). 194 (95\u00b71%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61\u00b78% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally. This analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world. Gates Foundation.",

Less is known about the potential impact of exposure to violence on allostatic load. According to allostatic load theory, chronic stressors, such as exposure to violence, may lead to disrupted physiological functioning in multiple systems, ultimately increasing the risk for poor health. As such, a better understanding of whether and how exposure to violence may affect indicators of allostatic load is critical. In the present systematic review, we synthesize evidence from 36 studies examining associations between exposure to violence and at least one of the four primary mediators of allostatic load: cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dehydroepiandrosterone.

Twenty-five eligible studies on 93,899 (33,834 AUD intervention) patients with ALD were analyzed. Data presented as HR, with a 95% CI. Of 14 studies in patients with ALD outside the liver transplantation (LT) setting, pooled data from 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that AUD treatment reduces alcohol relapse by 73% (HR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.15-0.46) with any treatment and by 77% (HR: 0.23, 95% CI:0.14-0.39) with medications in 5 RCTs on 322 (186 intervention) patients. AUD treatment from observational studies was associated with reduced readmission (5 studies) by 48% and decompensation (2 studies) by 52%, but not patient mortality (3 studies). Data showed moderate to high heterogeneity, without publication bias. Analysis of 8 observational studies on LT recipients showed that AUD treatment reduced alcohol relapse in the post-LT period by 59%, with 58% and 60% reduction using integrated and nonintegrated models, respectively. AUD treatment among LT recipients was associated with a reduction in patient mortality by 56% in 3 observational studies, but not in 2 RCTs (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.38-1.79). Pooled data were homogeneous in the analysis of alcohol relapse but showed moderate heterogeneity in analyzing patient mortality. Available data on AUD treatment in patients with ALD improves abstinence and liver-related outcomes both outside and within LT settings. RCTs are needed to examine (a) medications in patients with ALD to examine the benefit of alcohol relapse and patient outcomes and (b) the benefit of integrated multidisciplinary treatment to manage the dual pathology (AUD and liver disease).",

Although NCNPs are less harmful than tobacco smoking, their impact on oral health remains unclear. A systematic review and network\u00a0meta-analysis will be conducted to answer the research question: What are the oral signs and symptoms associated with NCNPs as both monotherapies and combination therapies compared to each other, placebo, standard care,\u00a0no drug treatment, and combustible cigarette smoking? We will search PubMed and Scopus databases, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to August 2024. This review will focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum follow-up period of 1\u00a0month, comparing any NCNPs versus placebo, standard care, no drug treatment, combustible cigarette smoking or to each other in adult smokers. Our primary outcomes will be the number of participants reporting any oral side effect, aphthous ulcers, dry mouth and mouth irritation. Studies will be excluded if they involve: non-smokers, pregnant women, individuals with mental health or neurological disorders, participants consuming alcohol or other substances. Data will be analyzed using a network meta-analysis framework, estimating odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Risk of bias will be determined using the Cochrane risk of bias tool-version 2.0 for included RCTs and the Confidence In Network Meta-Analysis tool will be employed to assess the confidence of evidence contributing to each network estimate. Our findings will provide critical insights into the oral health implications of NCNPs, informing clinical and public health decisions.

    "title": "Understanding the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of lifestyle modification interventions in adults with learning disabilities: a mixed-methods systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Adults with learning disabilities face increased risks of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, including alcohol consumption, smoking, low physical activity, sedentary behaviour and poor diet. Lifestyle modification interventions that target health-risk behaviours can prevent or\u00a0reduce their negative effects. The goal of this project was to investigate the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of lifestyle modification interventions in adults with learning disabilities. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the effectiveness of lifestyle modification interventions and their components in targeting health risk behaviours in adults with learning disabilities. Major electronic databases, clinical trial registries, grey literature, and citations of systematic reviews and included studies were searched in January 2021 (updated in February 2022). We included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials targeting alcohol consumption, smoking, low physical activity only, sedentary behaviour and poor\u00a0diet in adults (aged \u2265 18 years) with learning disabilities.\u00a0Studies were also coded based on the extent of use of theories and behaviour change techniques in interventions. Risk of bias in studies was assessed using appropriate tools. A realist synthesis of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods literature was conducted to complement the systematic review findings by identifying key intervention mechanisms that are likely to improve the health of adults with learning disabilities. Data were synthesised in the form of a programme theory regarding complex causal mechanisms and how these interact with social context to produce outcomes. All findings were integrated into a logic model. A patient and public involvement group provided input and insights throughout the project. A total of 80 studies with 4805 participants were included in the systematic review. The complexity of lifestyle modification interventions was dismantled by identifying six core components that influenced outcomes. These components could be present in interventions targeting single or multiple health risk behaviors, either as individual elements or in various combinations. Interventions on alcohol and smoking behaviours were found to be effective, but this was based on limited evidence. The effectiveness of interventions targeting low physical activity only or multiple behaviours (low physical activity only, sedentary behaviours and poor diet) was mixed. All interventions had a varying level of statistical significance. The intervention-level network meta-analysis for weight management outcomes\u00a0showed none of the interventions was associated with a statistically significant change in outcomes when compared to treatment as usual and each other. Similar findings were observed in the component network meta-analysis. A variety of theories and behaviour change techniques were employed in the development and adaptation of interventions. Most studies had a high and moderate risk of bias. A total of 79 studies, reporting the experiences of more than 3604 adults with intellectual disabilities and over 490 caregivers, were included in the realist synthesis. The resulting programme theory highlighted the contexts and mechanisms relating to support involvement, negotiating the balance between autonomy and behaviour change, fostering social connectedness and fun, the accessibility and suitability of intervention strategies and delivery, along with the broader behavioural pathways to lifestyle change. It also brought out the importance of working with people with lived experiences when developing and evaluating interventions. Our logic model, bringing together the findings of both syntheses, provides guidance on the design of future interventions. This study was the first comprehensive mixed-methods evidence synthesis to explore lifestyle modification interventions targeting multiple unhealthy lifestyle behaviours in adults with learning disabilities. We conclude that future research could benefit from codeveloping interventions and population-specific assessment frameworks with people with lived experiences. There is a need for more high-quality research with appropriate outcomes and a focus on qualitative and mixed-methods research to better understand what works for whom and why. This trial is registered as PROSPERO CRD 42020223290. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: NIHR128755) and is published in full in  Adults with learning disabilities are more likely to have an unhealthy lifestyle. This includes alcohol misuse, smoking, not much physical activity and an unhealthy diet. An unhealthy lifestyle can cause serious health problems. We wanted to understand what and why lifestyle change programmes for adults with learning disabilities work, how they work and why they work sometimes but not others. We searched for studies about lifestyle change programmes on alcohol consumption, smoking, low physical activity only, sedentary behaviour, and poor diet in adults with learning disabilities. We split our review into two. The first review focused on studies on lifestyle change programmes. The second review focused on some studies from the first review and also studies that interviewed people with learning disabilities and their caregivers. We also asked what people with learning disabilities and other researchers thought were important. Our first review found 80 studies with 4805 adults. Studies showed mixed results related to what existing lifestyle change programmes work in adults with learning disabilities. Our second review found 79 studies. It explained the results of the first review and identified key characteristics of lifestyle programmes that are likely to improve the lives of adults with learning disabilities. Both reviews found that changing the lifestyles of adults with learning disabilities is very complex. We identified various personal, health, social and environmental aspects that are important to adults with learning disabilities. Current lifestyle change programmes need to consider the needs, wants and lives of people with learning disabilities. The best way to do this is by involving people with lived experiences when making the programmes.",

    "title": "Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation.",
    "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating an e-liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if ECs can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This is a review update conducted as part of a living systematic review. To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of using EC to help people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 February 2024 and the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register to 1 February 2023, reference-checked, and contacted study authors. We included trials randomizing people who smoke to an EC or control condition. We included uncontrolled intervention studies in which all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to report an eligible outcome. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. We used the risk of bias tool (RoB 1) and GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer-term EC use. We used a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel model to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences. Where appropriate, we pooled data in pairwise and network meta-analyses (NMA). We included 90 completed studies (two new to this update), representing 29,044 participants, of which 49 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of the included studies, we rated 10 (all but one contributing to our main comparisons) at low risk of bias overall, 61 at high risk overall (including all non-randomized studies), and the remainder at unclear risk. Nicotine EC results in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high-certainty evidence) (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.93; I There is high-certainty evidence that ECs with nicotine increase quit rates compared to NRT and moderate-certainty evidence that they increase quit rates compared to ECs without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with usual care or no treatment also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study design. Confidence intervals were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence for a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine ECs nor between nicotine ECs and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger studies are needed to fully evaluate EC safety. Our included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision due to the small number of RCTs, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this is a living systematic review. We run searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.",

This systematic review explores the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of digital technology in mental health, with a focus on informing mental health system strengthening interventions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of databases was conducted up to August 2023 and identified a total of 8479 citations of which 114 studies were included in the qualitative analysis. The included studies encompass diverse digital interventions, platforms, and modalities used across various mental health conditions. The review identifies feasible, acceptable, and efficacious interventions, ranging from telehealth and mobile apps to virtual reality and machine learning models. Opportunities for improving access to care, reducing patients\u2019 transfers, and utilizing real-world interaction data for symptom monitoring are highlighted. However, challenges such as digital exclusion, privacy concerns, and potential service replacement caution policymakers. This study serves as a valuable evidence base for policymakers and mental health stakeholders in the UAE to navigate the integration of digital technology in mental health services effectively.",

    "title": "Health system barriers influencing timely breast cancer diagnosis and treatment among women in low and middle-income Asian countries: evidence from a mixed-methods systematic review",
    "abstract": "Globally, breast cancer is the most common cancer type and the leading cause of cancer mortality among women in developing countries. A high prevalence of late breast cancer diagnosis and treatment has been reported predominantly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), including those in Asia. Thus, this study utilized a mixed-methods systematic review to synthesize the health system barriers influencing timely breast cancer diagnosis and treatment among women in Asian countries. We systematically searched five electronic databases for studies published in English from 2012 to 2022 on health system barriers that influence timely breast cancer diagnosis and treatment among women in Asian countries. The review was conducted per the methodology for systematic reviews and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, while health system barriers were extracted and classified based on the World Health Organization (WHO)\u2018s Health Systems Framework. The mixed-methods appraisal tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Twenty-six studies were included in this review. Fifteen studies were quantitative, nine studies were qualitative, and two studies used a mixed-methods approach. These studies were conducted across ten countries in Asia. This review identified health systems barriers that influence timely breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The factors were categorized under the following: (1) delivery of health services (2) health workforce (3) financing for health (4) health information system and (5) essential medicines and technology. Delivery of health care (low quality of health care) was the most occurring barrier followed by the health workforce (unavailability of physicians), whilst health information systems were identified as the least barrier. This study concluded that health system factors such as geographical accessibility to treatment, misdiagnosis, and long waiting times at health facilities were major barriers to early breast cancer diagnosis and treatment among Asian women in LMICs. Eliminating these barriers will require deliberate health system strengthening, such as improving training for the health workforce and establishing more healthcare facilities.",

    "abstract": "Stigmatisation is a major issue faced by those affected by leprosy globally. Reducing stigmatisation encourages care seeking behaviour to occur earlier and can help reduce harm and spread of leprosy. This systematic literature review aimed to summarise what effective stigma reducing interventions exist for leprosy, and as a secondary question explore what evidence exists regarding their cost. A systematic literature review was conducted. Three databases\u2013PubMed, Embase and Web of science\u2013were searched using the search terms \u201cleprosy\u201d, \u201cinterven*\u201d, \u201creduc*\u201d, and \u201cstigma*\u201d.Seventeen publications were eligible for inclusion in the review. The current manuscript identified interventions under 6 main categories (i) Information, education, and communication (IEC) (ii) community led projects, (iii) Socioeconomic rehabilitation, (iv) mixed interventions, (v) integration of leprosy within the health system and (vi) Cosmetic or surgical care. Specific evidence regarding cost was only provided by one out of the seventeen papers. Multiple interventions were shown to successfully reduce leprosy related stigma, however, information on their cost is not readily available. The evidence uncovered by this review is restricted to three Asian countries; Nepal, India and Indonesia. To ensure the success of stigma reduction in leprosy interventions worldwide these interventions need to be tried in other leprosy endemic areas to test their effectiveness across contextual and cultural scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Background Recent years have seen record levels of migration to Europe. Female migrants are at heightened risk of developing mental health disorders, yet they face barriers to accessing mental health services in their host countries. This systematic review aims to summarise the barriers and facilitators to accessing mental health support for female migrants in Europe. Methods The review follows PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was pre-published on PROSPERO. Six electronic databases were searched: CINAHL, Global Health Database, Medline, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the identified studies. A feminist quality appraisal tool was applied. Results Eight qualitative, six quantitative and five mixed methods studies were identified. Barriers included a lack of information, stigma, religious and cultural practices and beliefs, and a lack of consideration of gender-specific needs within the health system. Gender-sensitive services, supportive general practitioners and religious leaders facilitated access. Conclusions The design of mental health research, services, policies, and commissioning of support for migrants must consider female migrant needs. Mental health support services must be culturally aware and gender sensitive.

    "abstract": "Introduction Research into the mental healthcare of emerging adults (18\u201325) in Canada has been limited, despite this developmental period being widely considered a vulnerable time of life. As such, we aimed to identify the greatest barriers emerging adults faced in accessing mental healthcare in Canada, particularly in relation to the Canadian healthcare system which operates on a universal funding model but is challenged by funding shortfalls and a complex relationship to the provinces. Methods We systematically examined 28 pieces of literature, including academic and technical literature and publications from government organizations, focused on emerging adults and the Canadian mental healthcare system. Results Findings demonstrated that stigma, a lack of mental health knowledge, cost, and interpersonal factors (e.g., one\u2019s parental, peer, and romantic supports demonstrating negative views toward mental healthcare may deter treatment; emerging adults demonstrating concerns that accessing mental healthcare may lead to peer rejection) acted as barriers to help-seeking in emerging adults. Additionally, a lack of national institutional cohesion and a lack of policy pertaining to emerging adult healthcare acted as barriers to adequate mental healthcare in this demographic. Discussion Improving mental health education early in life shows promise at reducing many of the barriers emerging adults face in accessing mental healthcare. Further, policies directed at ensuring a cohesive national mental health system, as well as policies directly designed to care for emerging adult mental health needs, could act as the next steps toward ensuring an accessible and effective Canadian mental healthcare system that can serve as a model for other nations.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer patients in sub-Saharan Africa experience long time intervals between their first presentation to a health care facility and the start of cancer treatment. The role of the health system in the increasing treatment time intervals has not been widely investigated. This review aimed to identify existing information on health system factors that influence diagnostic and treatment intervals in women with breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa to contribute to the reorientation of health policies in the region. PubMed, ScienceDirect, African Journals Online, Mendeley, ResearchGate and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant studies published between 2010 and July 2020. We performed a qualitative synthesis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Related health system factors were extracted and classified according to the World Health Organization\u2019s six health system building blocks. The quality of qualitative and quantitative studies was assessed by using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Quality-Assessment Tool and the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool, respectively. In addition, we used the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research tool to assess the evidence for each qualitative finding. From 14,184 identified studies, this systematic review included 28 articles. We identified a total of 36 barriers and 8 facilitators that may influence diagnostic and treatment intervals in women with breast cancer. The principal health system factors identified were mainly related to human resources and service delivery, particularly difficulty accessing health care, diagnostic errors, poor management, and treatment cost. The present review shows that diagnostic and treatment intervals among women with breast cancer in sub-Saharan Africa are influenced by many related health system factors. Policy makers in sub-Saharan Africa need to tackle the financial accessibility to breast cancer treatment by adequate universal health coverage policies and reinforce the clinical competencies for health workers to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate care for women with breast cancer in this region.",

    "title": "The impact of stigma on mental health and quality of life of infertile women: A systematic review",
    "abstract": "Introduction The stigma of not giving birth to children affects approximately 53. 08~64% of female infertility patients worldwide. This stigma not only causes harm to the mental health of these infertility patients, but also affects their quality of life, making them bear the adverse social consequences such as domestic violence, marriage breakdown, or even delay in receiving the treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the patients' stigma and effective intervention in alleviating it. Aims/Question This study aims to discuss and summarize the stigma in infertile women and its impact on patients, and to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment and nursing intervention of disease stigma in infertile female patients. Methods The literature search used four English databases (Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed) and two Chinese databases (CNKI and Wanfang). The search time of the literature ranges from the establishment of the library to 2022, with no language restriction. Results The review included 28 studies, with 20 cross-sectional studies and 8 qualitative studies. This study found that social support, living environment, education level, occupation, and fertility awareness were the major influencing factors of infertility stigma. Conclusions Infertility stigma can bring heavy mental pressure and psychological burden to female infertility patients and affect their quality of life. Therefore, effective and targeted psychological interventions should be developed to reduce the patients' stigma and improve their quality of life. Implications for practice Healthcare workers must develop targeted nursing interventions, provide professional counseling services to reduce the level of stigma in female infertility patients, alleviate fertility stress, and improve their quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to systematically review the types of stigmatized attributes that have been assessed and the causes and consequences of stigma for individuals involved in the criminal legal system. PubMed, GoogleScholar, and PsycInfo databases were searched to identify studies for inclusion through March 2021. Eligible studies were peer-reviewed, quantitative, and assessed stigma from the perspective of the person involved in the criminal legal system. 59 studies were included (total n=21,738), assessing stigma associated with criminal involvement, HIV, substance use, race/ethnicity, help-seeking, and others. Experiencing criminal involvement stigma was linked to poor well-being, but less so for racial/ethnic minorities. Experiencing racial/ethnic stigma was associated with recidivism risk, and substance use stigma was associated with substance use risk. Several stigmas intersected to impact treatment engagement and well-being. In conclusion, individuals involved in the criminal legal system experience many stigmatized statuses that impact their well-being, treatment adherence, community integration, and criminal behavior. Stigma must be addressed among individuals involved in the criminal legal system and the systems they interact with to reduce health inequity and recidivism risk.",

Health literacy is a critical factor in maximizing ART adherence and healthcare utilization, especially among vulnerable populations, including racial and ethnic minorities. This U.S-based systematic review examines psychosocial variables influencing health literacy among persons with HIV (PWH), with a focus on racial and ethnic minorities. Although findings are limited, some studies showed that HIV-related stigma, self-efficacy, and patient trust in providers mediate the relationship between health literacy and both ART adherence and HIV care retention. To inform effective, equitable health literacy interventions to promote adherence to HIV treatment and care, further research is needed to understand the factors driving the relationship between health literacy and HIV outcomes.

Design Systematic review Data sources PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, SportDiscus (Ebsco), and PsycINFO (ProQuest) up to November 2018. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Qualitative and quantitative original studies of elite athletes (those who competed at the professional, Olympic, or collegiate/university levels), published in any language. Results Stigma, low mental health literacy, negative past experiences with mental health treatment-seeking, busy schedules, and hypermasculinity are barriers to elite athletes seeking mental health treatment. Cultural influencers of mental health in elite athletes include: (1) the lack of acceptance of women as athletes; (2) lower acceptability of mental health symptoms and disorders among non-white athletes; (3) non-disclosure of religious beliefs; and (4) higher dependence on economic benefits. Coaches have an important role in supporting elite athletes in obtaining treatment for mental illness. Brief anti-stigma interventions in elite athletes decrease stigma and improve literary about mental health. Conclusion There is a need for various actors to provide more effective strategies to overcome the stigma that surrounds mental illness, increase mental health literacy in the athlete/coach community, and address athlete-specific barriers to seeking treatment for mental illness. In this systematic review, we identified strategies that, if implemented, can overcome the cultural factors that may otherwise limit athletes seeking treatment. Coaches are critical for promoting a culture within elite athletes\u2019 environments that encourages athletes to seek treatment.",

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, extracted data, and assessed study quality using CHEERS 2022 and Phillips\u2019s checklist. Results Thirteen model-based cost-utility studies met the inclusion criteria, evaluating Empagliflozin (n\u2009=\u20093), Canagliflozin (n\u2009=\u20093), and Dapagliflozin (n\u2009=\u20098). Empagliflozin or Dapagliflozin plus standard care (SoC) was cost-effective compared to SoC alone in CKD patients, regardless of type 2 diabetes (T2D) status. In CKD patients with T2D, SGLT2 inhibitors combined with SoC were cost-saving in high-income countries under health system perspective whereas Dapagliflozin was not cost-effective compared to Canagliflozin. No study met all criteria of the CHEERS 2022 checklist, and most did not fully satisfy Phillips\u2019s checklist for economic models. Conclusion Adding SGLT2 inhibitors to SoC is cost-saving for treating CKD with T2D and cost-effective for CKD patients with or without T2D. Registration The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) under registration number CRD42023469005.",

    "title": "Stigma Pada Penderita HIV/AIDS: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a virus that attacks the human immune system. Negative stigma in HIV/AIDS patients can affect the level of quality of life of HIV patients, which in turn can affect the patient's psychology, self-confidence, and career. Factors that cause discrimination against PLWHA are the low level of education and public understanding of HIV/AIDS. Objective: to determine the stigma of HIV/AIDS sufferers. Method: The method for preparing this article is the PRISMA method with database searches including Google Scholar, Digital Reference Garba, and Science Direct, using 10 articles based on inclusion criteria, namely published in 2019-2023, can be accessed in full text, articles in Indonesian and English and is research qualitative. Results: Of the 10 articles that have been analyzed, it is stated that stigma in HIV/AIDS sufferers can affect aspects of mental health, especially the quality of life of HIV/AIDS sufferers. The stigma faced by leprosy sufferers is self-stigma and public stigma. Conclusion: The stigma experienced by HIV patients comes from themselves, their families, society, and the surrounding environment. Stigma also causes depression and anxiety, feelings of sadness, guilt, and feelings of lack of worth due to low levels of knowledge about HIV/AIDS",

    "title": "The Characteristics and HIV-Related Outcomes of People Living with Co-occurring HIV and Mental Health Conditions in the United States: A Systematic Review of Literature from 2016 to 2021",
    "abstract": "Considering advances in HIV prevention and treatment, jurisdictional efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and reduced stigma towards people living with HIV infection and mental health conditions, the authors systematically reviewed studies published between 2016 and 2021 and identified 45 studies that met the eligibility criteria. The review found that stigma towards mental health conditions still acts as a barrier to accessing HIV treatment, which impacts treatment outcomes. Additionally, social determinants of health, such as housing instability and poverty, appear to impact mental health and, therefore, HIV-related outcomes. The review also highlighted the mutually reinforcing effects of HIV, mental health, and substance use conditions, providing valuable insights into the syndemic effects of these co-occurring conditions. Overall, the review highlights the need to address stigma and social determinants of health in HIV prevention and treatment efforts and to integrate mental health services into HIV care to improve outcomes for people living with both HIV and mental health conditions.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Stigmatic attitudes appear to vary across different mental health diagnoses, and offenders with mental illness have been shown to elicit more negative stigmatic attitudes than offenders without mental illness. Stigma and discrimination can have detrimental effects on an individual's recovery, treatment and even employment opportunities. This systematic review aimed to report the commonality of research into stigma towards offenders with mental health conditions, to explore if different mental health diagnoses were associated with differential rates of stigma in offenders, and to ascertain which psychometric measures have been used to capture such stigmatic attitudes. Twelve studies were included in the review with varied populations and study locations. The vast majority reported negative stigmatic attitudes towards offenders with mental illness when compared to control groups, with neither a criminal history nor a mental illness. Results also indicated that the diagnoses with particularly high levels of stigma were psychopathy and schizophrenia. Psychometric measures used to capture stigma varied considerably and rarely was the same measure used across studies which limited comparisons. This review highlights a number of key points for advancing research in the area which are discussed along with strengths and limitations.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUD) in tuberculosis patients are complicated with poor compliance to anti-tuberculosis treatment and poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes. However, aggregate data concerning this problem is not available. Therefore, this review aimed to fill the above gap by generating an average prevalence of AUD in tuberculosis patients. Our electronic search for original articles was conducted in the databases of Scopus, PubMed, and EMBASE, African Index Medicus, and psych-info. Besides, the reference list of selected articles was looked at manually to have further eligible articles for the prevalence and associated factors of AUD in tuberculosis patients. The random-effects model was employed during the analysis. MS-Excel was used to extract data and stata-11 to determine the average prevalence of AUD among tuberculosis patients. A sub-group analysis and sensitivity analysis were also run. A visual inspection of the funnel plots and an Eggers publication bias plot test were checked for the presence of publication bias. A search of the electronic and manual system resulted in 1970 articles. After removing duplicates and unoriginal articles, only 28 articles that studied 30,854 tuberculosis patients met the inclusion criteria. The average estimated prevalence of AUD in tuberculosis patients was 30% (95% CI: 24.00, 35.00). This was with a slight heterogeneity (I This review obtained a high average prevalence of AUD in tuberculosis patients and this varies across continents, design of studies, mean age of the participants, and assessment tool used.

    "title": "Effectiveness and treatment moderators of internet interventions for adult problem drinking: An individual patient data meta-analysis of 19 randomised controlled trials",
    "abstract": "Background Face-to-face brief interventions for problem drinking are effective, but they have found limited implementation in routine care and the community. Internet-based interventions could overcome this treatment gap. We investigated effectiveness and moderators of treatment outcomes in internet-based interventions for adult problem drinking (iAIs). Methods and findings Systematic searches were performed in medical and psychological databases to 31 December 2016. A one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) was conducted with a linear mixed model complete-case approach, using baseline and first follow-up data. The primary outcome measure was mean weekly alcohol consumption in standard units (SUs, 10 grams of ethanol). Secondary outcome was treatment response (TR), defined as less than 14/21 SUs for women/men weekly. Putative participant, intervention, and study moderators were included. Robustness was verified in three sensitivity analyses: a two-stage IPDMA, a one-stage IPDMA using multiple imputation, and a missing-not-at-random (MNAR) analysis. We obtained baseline data for 14,198 adult participants (19 randomised controlled trials [RCTs], mean age 40.7 [SD = 13.2], 47.6% women). Their baseline mean weekly alcohol consumption was 38.1 SUs (SD = 26.9). Most were regular problem drinkers (80.1%, SUs 44.7, SD = 26.4) and 19.9% (SUs 11.9, SD = 4.1) were binge-only drinkers. About one third were heavy drinkers, meaning that women/men consumed, respectively, more than 35/50 SUs of alcohol at baseline (34.2%, SUs 65.9, SD = 27.1). Post-intervention data were available for 8,095 participants. Compared with controls, iAI participants showed a greater mean weekly decrease at follow-up of 5.02 SUs (95% CI \u22127.57 to \u22122.48, p < 0.001) and a higher rate of TR (odds ratio [OR] 2.20, 95% CI 1.63\u20132.95, p < 0.001, number needed to treat [NNT] = 4.15, 95% CI 3.06\u20136.62). Persons above age 55 showed higher TR than their younger counterparts (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.21\u20132.27, p = 0.002). Drinking profiles were not significantly associated with treatment outcomes. Human-supported interventions were superior to fully automated ones on both outcome measures (comparative reduction: \u22126.78 SUs, 95% CI \u221212.11 to \u22121.45, p = 0.013; TR: OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.22\u20134.08, p = 0.009). Participants treated in iAIs based on personalised normative feedback (PNF) alone were significantly less likely to sustain low-risk drinking at follow-up than those in iAIs based on integrated therapeutic principles (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.29\u20130.93, p = 0.029). The use of waitlist control in RCTs was associated with significantly better treatment outcomes than the use of other types of control (comparative reduction: \u22129.27 SUs, 95% CI \u221213.97 to \u22124.57, p < 0.001; TR: OR = 3.74, 95% CI 2.13\u20136.53, p < 0.001). The overall quality of the RCTs was high; a major limitation included high study dropout (43%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our primary analyses. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first IPDMA on internet-based interventions that has shown them to be effective in curbing various patterns of adult problem drinking in both community and healthcare settings. Waitlist control may be conducive to inflation of treatment outcomes.",

    "title": "How effective are brief interventions in reducing alcohol consumption: do the setting, practitioner group and content matter? Findings from a systematic review and metaregression analysis",
    "abstract": "Background While the efficacy and effectiveness of brief interventions for alcohol (ABI) have been demonstrated in primary care, there is weaker evidence in other settings and reviews do not consider differences in content. We conducted a systematic review to measure the effect of ABIs on alcohol consumption and how it differs by the setting, practitioner group and content of intervention. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO; CINAHL, Social Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library and Global Health up to January 2015 for randomised controlled trials that measured effectiveness of ABIs on alcohol consumption. We grouped outcomes into measures of quantity and frequency indices. We used multilevel meta-analysis to estimate pooled effect sizes and tested for the effect of moderators through a multiparameter Wald test. Stratified analysis of a subset of quantity and frequency outcomes was conducted as a sensitivity check. Results 52 trials were included contributing data on 29\u2005891 individuals. ABIs reduced the quantity of alcohol consumed by 0.15 SDs. While neither the setting nor content appeared to significantly moderate intervention effectiveness, the provider did in some analyses. Interventions delivered by nurses had the most effect in reducing quantity (d=\u22120.23, 95% CI (\u22120.33 to \u22120.13)) but not frequency of alcohol consumption. All content groups had statistically significant mean effects, brief advice was the most effective in reducing quantity consumed (d=\u22120.20, 95% CI (\u22120.30 to \u22120.09)). Effects were maintained in the stratified sensitivity analysis at the first and last assessment time. Conclusions ABIs play a small but significant role in reducing alcohol consumption. Findings show the positive role of nurses in delivering interventions. The lack of evidence on the impact of content of intervention reinforces advice that services should select the ABI tool that best suits their needs.",

Method Time-series analyses were conducted using routinely collected patient records and semi-structured interviews, guided by the consolidated framework for implementation research. Results The six intervention sites significantly increased their rate of recorded alcohol status (56.7% to 60.4%), whereas there was no significant change in the non-intervention practices (344 sites, 55.2% to 56.4%).

    "title": "Efficacy of brief intervention for drug misuse in primary care facilities: systematic review and meta-analysis protocol",
    "abstract": "Introduction Drug misuse is associated with significant global morbidity, mortality, economic costs and social costs. Many primary care facilities have integrated drug misuse screening and brief intervention (BI) into their usual care delivery. However, the efficacy of BI for drug misuse in primary care has not been substantiated through meta-analysis. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the efficacy of BI for drug misuse in primary care settings. Methods and analysis We will include all randomised controlled trials comparing primary care-delivered BI for drug misuse with no intervention or minimal screening/assessment and usual care. Primary outcomes are (1) drug use frequency scores and (2) severity scores at intermediate follow-up (4\u20138 months). We will retrieve all studies through searches in CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE and PsycINFO until 31 May 2020. The reference list will be supplemented with searches in trial registries (eg, www.clinicaltrials.gov) and through relevant existing study reference lists identified in the literature. We will conduct a random-effect pairwise meta-analysis for primary and secondary outcomes. We will assess statistical heterogeneity though visual inspection of a forest plot and calculate I 2 statistics. We will assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool V.2 and evaluate the certainty of evidence through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Sensitivity analyses will account for studies with control group variations and studies with a high risk of bias. If heterogeneity is present, subgroup analyses will consider patient variables of age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, per cent insured, baseline severity and primary drug misused. Ethics and dissemination This study will use published aggregate data and will not require ethical approval. Findings will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.",

    "abstract": "Implementation of screening brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) and medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) remains low in primary care. ANTECEDENT (Partnerships to Enhance Alcohol Screening, Treatment, and Intervention) was a practice-facilitator led implementation study to increase SBIRT and MAUD use in diverse primary care clinics. From November 2019 \u2013 April 2023, we conducted a convergent parallel mixed methods evaluation. Participants were small and medium-sized primary care clinics in the Northwestern U.S. Clinics received foundational support (i.e., baseline/exit assessment, access to SBIRT Oregon website) and the option for supplemental implementation support (e.g., practice facilitation, expert consultation) over the 15-month intervention to improve SBIRT and MAUD. Qualitative and quantitative data regarding clinic characteristics, implementation strategies, and SBIRT/MAUD outcomes were collected through practice facilitator interviews, periodic reflections and clinic contact logs, interviews, pre-post surveys, and electronic health record (EHR) queries. Quantitative analyses included descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and the Wilcoxon sign-ranked test. Qualitative analysis took an immersion crystallization approach. Data were reviewed in a matrix to evaluate intervention adoption, implementation, and effectiveness. We recruited 75 unique clinics; 66 participated and 48 (73%) completed the study. Eight participating clinics chose to receive foundational support only (12%) while 58 chose to engage in supplemental support (88%) activities. Clinics that received supplemental support and completed the intervention (n\u2009=\u200942) engaged in practice facilitation (Mean: 293 min, range: 75\u2013550 min); data review (38%), HIT support (31%), expert consultation (19%), and peer-to-peer learning (5%). Pre- and post-intervention assessments showed significant improvement in self-reported SBIRT process outcomes. Performance data improved among the subset of completing clinics able to produce data (n\u2009=\u200917). Clinics described positive experiences with ANTECEDENT support and highlighted remaining barriers to SBIRT and MAUD implementation. Participating clinics engaged in a diverse range of supportive activities. A flexible approach using practice facilitation and implementation support could be helpful for low-resourced primary care clinics in improving SBIRT and MAUD for unhealthy alcohol use.",

    "abstract": "Background: The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual alcohol screening and brief behavioral intervention (alcohol SBI) with general adult and pregnant populations. Implementation of alcohol SBI in primary care has encountered numerous barriers to adapting procedures and infrastructure to support its routine delivery. This collection of case studies describes the implementation strategies used by 4 academic health system teams that were funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement alcohol SBI within healthcare systems to prevent alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Methods: We used constructs from the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Expanded (FRAME) to describe planned and unplanned adaptations to implementation strategies, and the SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) Program Matrix to identify key questions, challenges, and recommendations for improving alcohol SBI implementation. Participating systems were 2 regional affiliates of a national reproductive healthcare organization, an integrated non-profit healthcare system, and an urban medical center and its affiliated network of community health centers. Results: Planned adaptations included expanding the target population for brief interventions to include patients drinking at low levels who could become pregnant, modifying workflows and systems to support routine screening, and customizing training content and logistics. Unplanned adaptations included varying site recruitment and pre-implementation awareness-building strategies to enhance local receptivity of systems with decentralized management, and pivoting from in-person to virtual training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fewer unplanned adaptations were observed for health systems with centralized management structures and practice teams that were fully engaged in implementation planning, training, roll-out, and problem-solving. Conclusions: Unplanned adaptations were observed across the 4 cases and emphasized the importance of flexible, adaptive designs when implementing evidence-based practice in dynamic settings. Participation of the health system in planning, including decisions to modify electronic health records and workflows, supported adapting to unplanned circumstances to achieve implementation goals.",

    "title": "Facilitating Screening and Brief Interventions in Primary Care: A Systematic Review and Meta\u2010Analysis of the AUDIT as an Indicator of Alcohol Use Disorders",
    "abstract": "Background The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was developed for use in primary health care settings to identify hazardous and harmful patterns of alcohol consumption, and is often used to screen for alcohol use disorders (AUDs). This study examined the AUDIT as a screening tool for AUDs. Methods A systematic literature search was performed of electronic bibliographic databases (CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science) without language or geographic restrictions for original quantitative studies published before September 1, 2018, that assess the AUDIT's ability to screen for AUDs. Random\u2010effects meta\u2010regression models were constructed by sex to assess the potential determinants of the AUDIT's specificity and sensitivity. From these models and ecological data from the Global Information System on Alcohol and Health, the true\u2010 and false\u2010positive and true\u2010 and false\u2010negative proportions were determined. The number of people needed to be screened to treat 1 individual with an AUD was estimated for all countries globally where AUD data exist, using a specificity of 0.95. Results A total of 36 studies met inclusion criteria for the meta\u2010regression. The AUDIT score cut\u2010point was significantly associated with sensitivity and specificity. Standard drink size was found to affect the sensitivity and specificity of the AUDIT for men, but not among women. The AUDIT performs less well in identifying women compared to men, and countries with a low prevalence of AUDs have higher false\u2010positive rates compared to countries with a higher AUD prevalence. Conclusions The AUDIT does not perform well as a screening tool for identifying individuals with an AUD, especially in countries and among populations with a low AUD prevalence (e.g., among women), and thus should not be used for this purpose.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe co-occurrence of unhealthy alcohol use and opioid misuse is high and associated with increased rates of overdose, emergency health care utilization, and death. The current study examined whether receipt of an alcohol-related brief intervention is associated with reduced risk of negative downstream opioid-related outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis retrospective cohort study included all VISN-6 Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) screening results (N=492,748) from 2014 to 2019. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between documentation of an alcohol-related brief intervention and probability of a new 1) opioid prescription, 2) opioid use disorder (OUD) diagnosis, or 3) opioid-related hospitalization in the following year, controlling for demographic and clinical covariates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the veterans, 13% (N=63,804) had \"positive\" AUDIT-C screen results. Of those, 72% (N=46,216) had a documented alcohol-related brief intervention. Within 1 year, 8.5% (N=5,430) had a new opioid prescription, 1.1% (N=698) had a new OUD diagnosis, and 0.8% (N=499) had a new opioid-related hospitalization. In adjusted models, veterans with positive AUDIT-C screen results who did not receive an alcohol-related brief intervention had higher odds of new opioid prescriptions (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.10, 95% CI=1.03-1.17) and new OUD diagnoses (adjusted OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.02-1.40), while new opioid-related hospitalizations (adjusted OR=1.19, 95% CI=0.99-1.44) were higher although not statistically significant. Removal of medications for OUD (MOUD) did not impact associations. All outcomes were significantly associated with an alcohol-related brief intervention in unadjusted models.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe VA's standard alcohol-related brief intervention is associated with subsequent lower odds of a new opioid prescription or a new OUD diagnosis. Results suggest a reduction in a cascade of new opioid-related outcomes from prescriptions through hospitalizations.",

Design A population-based observational study using electronic health records data. Setting An integrated healthcare system that implemented system-wide alcohol screening, BI and referral to treatment in adult primary care. Participants Adult primary care patients with hypertension (N=72 979) or T2D (N=19 642) who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use between 2014 and 2017. Main outcome measures We examined four drinking outcomes: changes in heavy drinking days/past 3 months, drinking days/week, drinks/drinking day and drinks/week from baseline to 12-month follow-up, based on results of alcohol screens conducted in routine care. Health outcome measures were changes in measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and BP reduction \u22653 mm Hg at 18-month follow-up. For patients with T2D, we also examined change in glycohaemoglobin (HbA1c) level and \u2018controlled HbA1c\u2019 (HbA1c<8%) at 18-month follow-up. Results For patients with hypertension, those who received BI had a modest but significant additional \u22120.06 reduction in drinks/drinking day (95% CI \u22120.11 to \u22120.01) and additional \u22120.30 reduction in drinks/week (95% CI \u22120.59 to \u22120.01) at 12 months, compared with those who did not. Patients with hypertension who received BI also had higher odds for having clinically meaningful reduction of diastolic BP at 18 months (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09). Among patients with T2D, no significant associations were found between BI and drinking or health outcomes examined. Conclusions Alcohol BI holds promise for reducing drinking and helping to improve health outcomes among patients with hypertension who screened positive for unhealthy drinking. However, similar associations were not observed among patients with T2D. More research is needed to understand the heterogeneity across diverse subpopulations and to study BI\u2019s long-term public health impact.",

    "title": "Efficacy of Brief Intervention for harmful and hazardous alcohol use: a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies from Low Middle-Income countries.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nLow and middle-income countries (LMIC) have a disproportionately higher alcohol-attributable disease burden, in conjunction with a minimal focus on primary prevention. Screening and brief interventions can be a promising approach to address this problem. This systematic review aimed to perform a qualitative and quantitative synthesis of studies of brief interventions for harmful and hazardous alcohol use in LMIC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSystematic review of randomized controlled trials of brief interventions for harmful and hazardous alcohol identified from four electronic databases, conducted in any country identified as LMIC as per the World Bank. We measured differences in intervention and control groups on risk-scores using standard screening instruments, the frequency of heavy drinking, the drinking risk-level, or quality of life and other mental health-related outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 14 studies were included, seven of them from South Africa. On standardized screening instruments, the brief intervention (BI) group had significantly lower scores than controls at 3 months (Hedges' g= - 0.34, P =0.04), but the effects did not persist at 6- and 12-month follow-up (g= - 0.06, P =0.68 and g= 0.15, P =0.41, respectively). There was little evidence to suggest that brief interventions led to changes in the frequency of heavy drinking or change in the risk level of alcohol use. Surprisingly, a single session (g= -0.55, P <0.001) fared better than multiple sessions (g= -0.03, P=0.85). A nurse delivered brief intervention (g= -0.44, P=0.02) showed better results than brief interventions delivered by others (g=-0.14, P=0.66), while the outcomes were similar for young adults and middle-aged people.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBrief interventions for alcohol use show some promise in low- and middle-income (LAMI) countries. Specifically, a single session, nurse-delivered brief intervention for harmful and hazardous alcohol use appears to show a small but significant positive effect in LAMI countries.",

    "title": "Psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions to reduce harmful alcohol use in low- and middle-income countries.",
    "abstract": "Harmful alcohol use is defined as unhealthy alcohol use that results in adverse physical, psychological, social, or societal consequences and is among the leading risk factors for disease, disability and premature mortality globally. The burden of harmful alcohol use is increasing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and there remains a large unmet need for indicated prevention and treatment interventions to reduce harmful alcohol use in these settings. Evidence regarding which interventions are effective and feasible for addressing harmful and other patterns of unhealthy alcohol use in LMICs is limited, which contributes to this gap in services. To assess the efficacy and safety of psychosocial and pharmacologic treatment and indicated prevention interventions compared with control conditions (wait list, placebo, no treatment, standard care, or active control condition) aimed at reducing harmful alcohol use in LMICs. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indexed in the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG) Specialized Register, the Cochrane Clinical Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) through 12 December 2021. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Web of Science, and Opengrey database to identify unpublished or ongoing studies. We searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles for eligible studies. All RCTs comparing an indicated prevention or treatment intervention (pharmacologic or psychosocial) versus a control condition for people with harmful alcohol use in LMICs were included. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included 66 RCTs with 17,626 participants. Sixty-two of these trials contributed to the meta-analysis. Sixty-three studies were conducted in middle-income countries (MICs), and the remaining three studies were conducted in low-income countries (LICs). Twenty-five trials exclusively enrolled participants with alcohol use disorder. The remaining 51 trials enrolled participants with harmful alcohol use, some of which included both cases of alcohol use disorder and people reporting hazardous alcohol use patterns that did not meet criteria for disorder. Fifty-two RCTs assessed the efficacy of psychosocial interventions; 27 were brief interventions primarily based on motivational interviewing and were compared to brief advice, information, or assessment only. We are uncertain whether a reduction in harmful alcohol use is attributable to brief interventions given the high levels of heterogeneity among included studies (Studies reporting continuous outcomes: Tau\u00b2 = 0.15, Q =139.64, df =16, P<.001, I\u00b2 = 89%, 3913 participants, 17 trials, very low certainty; Studies reporting dichotomous outcomes: Tau\u00b2=0.18, Q=58.26, df=3, P<.001, I\u00b2 =95%, 1349 participants, 4 trials, very low certainty). The other types of psychosocial interventions included a range of therapeutic approaches such as behavioral risk reduction, cognitive-behavioral therapy, contingency management, rational emotive therapy, and relapse prevention. These interventions were most commonly compared to usual care involving varying combinations of psychoeducation, counseling, and pharmacotherapy. We are uncertain whether a reduction in harmful alcohol use is attributable to psychosocial treatments due to high levels of heterogeneity among included studies (Heterogeneity: Tau\u00b2 = 1.15; Q = 444.32, df = 11, P<.001; I\u00b2=98%, 2106 participants, 12 trials, very low certainty). Eight trials compared combined pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions with placebo, psychosocial intervention alone, or another pharmacologic treatment. The active pharmacologic study conditions included disulfiram, naltrexone, ondansetron, or topiramate. The psychosocial components of these interventions included counseling, encouragement to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, motivational interviewing, brief cognitive-behavioral therapy, or other psychotherapy (not specified). Analysis of studies comparing a combined pharmacologic and psychosocial intervention to psychosocial intervention alone found that the combined approach may be associated with a greater reduction in harmful alcohol use (standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD))=-0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.61 to -0.24; 475 participants; 4 trials; low certainty). Four trials compared pharmacologic intervention alone with placebo and three with another pharmacotherapy. Drugs assessed were: acamprosate, amitriptyline, baclofen disulfiram, gabapentin, mirtazapine, and naltrexone. None of these trials evaluated the primary clinical outcome of interest, harmful alcohol use. \u00a0 Thirty-one trials reported rates of retention in the intervention. Meta-analyses revealed that rates of retention between study conditions did not differ in any of the comparisons (pharmacologic risk ratio (RR) = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.44, 247 participants, 3 trials, low certainty; pharmacologic in addition to psychosocial intervention: RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.95 to 1.40, 363 participants, 3 trials, moderate certainty). Due to high levels of heterogeneity, we did not calculate pooled estimates comparing retention in brief (Heterogeneity: Tau\u00b2 = 0.00; Q = 172.59, df = 11, P<.001; I In LMICs there is low-certainty evidence supporting the efficacy of combined psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions on reducing harmful alcohol use relative to psychosocial interventions alone. There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of pharmacologic or psychosocial interventions on reducing harmful alcohol use largely due to the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, comparisons, and interventions that precluded pooling of these data in meta-analyses. The majority of studies are brief interventions, primarily among men, and using measures that have not been validated in the target population. Confidence in these results is reduced by the risk of bias and significant heterogeneity among studies as well as the heterogeneity of results on different outcome measures within studies. More evidence on the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions, specific types of psychosocial interventions are needed to increase the certainty of these results.",

    "abstract": "Prior research suggests that brief interventions (BIs) for alcohol and other drug use may vary in effectiveness across patient sociodemographic factors. The objective of this individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis was to explore for whom BIs delivered in general healthcare settings are more or less effective. We examined variability in BI effects by patient age, sex, employment, education, relationship status, and baseline severity of substance use using a two-stage IPD meta-analysis approach. All trials included in a parent aggregate data meta-analysis (k\u2009=\u2009116) were invited to contribute IPD, and 29 trials provided patient-level data (12,074 participants). Among females, BIs led to significant reductions in binge alcohol consumption ([Formula: see text] = 0.09, 95% CI [0.03, 0.14]), frequency of alcohol consumption ([Formula: see text] = 0.10, 95% CI [0.03, 0.17]), and alcohol-related consequences ([Formula: see text] = 0.16, 95% CI [0.08, 0.25]), as well as greater substance use treatment utilization ([Formula: see text] = 0.25, 95% CI [0.21, 0.30]). BIs yielded larger reductions in frequency of alcohol consumption at 3-month follow-up for individuals with less than a high school level education ([Formula: see text] = 0.16, 95% CI [0.09, 0.22]). Given evidence demonstrating modest BI effects on alcohol use and mixed or null findings for BI effects on other drug use, BI research should continue to investigate potential drivers of effect magnitude and variation.\u00a0 PROTOCOL REGISTRATION DETAILS: The protocol for this review was pre-registered in PROSPERO #CRD42018086832 and the analysis plan was pre-registered in OSF:\u00a0osf.io/m48g6.",

    "abstract": "Psychosocial approaches are the hallmark of treatment for harmful alcohol use. However, the most effective psychosocial intervention has not been identified. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of psychosocial therapy for harmful alcohol use using a network meta-analysis approach. We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses from inception to January 2022. Randomized controlled trials in adults aged >\u200918\u2009years with harmful alcohol use were included. Psychosocial interventions were classified using the theme, intensity, and provider/platform (TIP) framework. The mean differences (MD) of the alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT) score were estimated in the primary analysis using a random-effects model. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) methods were used to rank different interventions. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) approach. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022328972). A total of 4225\u00a0records were retrieved from searches; 19 trials (n\u2009=\u20097149) met the inclusion criteria. The most common TIP combination was brief interventions delivered once via face-to-face sessions (six studies) and 11 TIP features were included in the network meta-analysis. A significant difference in AUDIT score was evident among 16 of 55 treatment comparisons, with the highest effect size observed when motivational interviewing plus cognitive behavioral therapy in multiple sessions via face-to-face (MI-CBT/Mult/F2F) was compared with usual care [MD\u2009=\u2009-4.98; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-7.04, -2.91]. This finding was consistent with SUCRA, which suggested that MI-CBT/Mult/F2F is most likely to be better than other interventions (SUCRA\u2009=\u200991.3). MI-CBT/Mult/F2F remained the highest-ranking intervention in our sensitivity analyses (SUCRA\u2009=\u200964.9, 80.8). However, the certainty of evidence for most treatment comparisons was low. Combined psychosocial intervention with a more intensive approach may provide greater effect in reducing harmful alcohol consumption behavior.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol dependence affects over 240 million people worldwide and attributed to 3 million deaths annually. Early identification and intervention are key to prevent harm. We aim to systematically review literature on the effectiveness of adding advice based on biomarkers of liver injury or non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis (intervention-based advice) to prevent alcohol misuse. Electronic search was conducted on Ovid Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Psychinfo and CINAHL for articles published up to end of February 2020. Additionally, we searched study citations, Scopus, Ethos and Clinical trials. The primary outcome measure was changed in self-reported alcohol consumption analysed by random-effects meta-analysis. Secondary outcomes included change to liver blood markers and alcohol-related health outcomes. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two observational studies comprising n\u00a0=\u00a03763 participants were included. Meta-analyses showed a greater reduction in alcohol consumption and liver biomarkers for the intervention compared to control group: mean difference for weekly alcohol intake was -74.4 g/week (95% confidence interval (CI) -126.1, -22.6, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and mean difference for gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) -19.7\u00a0IU/l (95% CI -33.1, -6.4, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). There was a higher incidence of alcohol-attributed mortality, number of days spent in the hospital, physician visits and sickness absence in the non-intervention group. The quality of the included studies was moderate for RCTs and high for observational studies. The review confirmed a significant association between the addition of intervention-based advice in routine care to the reduction of harmful alcohol consumption, GGT and alcohol-related mortality. The findings support the inclusion of this type of advice in routine alcohol care.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of brief interventions for cannabis use was assessed in a systematic review and meta-analyses. Systematic searches in academic databases were conducted, and reference lists of included studies were reviewed. Randomized trials were included that compared brief interventions with minimal control interventions for improving cannabis-specific outcomes among participants recruited from healthcare settings. Mean differences (MDs) based on change-from-baseline measurements were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses, with stratification by short term (\u22643 months) and long term (>3 months). Ten reports from 9 studies were included. Most studies were conducted in the United States, including participants who were adults and were recruited from primary care or emergency departments. There were no significant effects of brief interventions on cannabis-specific Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) scores in the short term (MD -1.27 points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.75, 1.21; I 84.40%). The null pattern of findings was also observed for number of days of cannabis use in the past 30 days in the short term (MD -0.22 days; 95% CI -2.27, 1.82; I 60.30%) and long term (MD -0.28 days; 95% CI -2.42, 1.86; I 60.50%). The evidence base for other outcomes not subjected to meta-analyses was limited and mixed. Brief interventions did not result in reductions in cannabis-specific ASSIST scores or number of days of cannabis use, whereas the evidence base for other outcomes was limited and mixed. As such, brief interventions in healthcare settings may not be efficacious for cannabis use.",

    "title": "Psychological interventions for alcohol use disorders in people living with HIV/AIDS: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) are a significant impediment to achieving virological control. HIV non-suppression in PLWH with AUDs is mainly attributable to sub-optimal antiretroviral therapy adherence. Sub-optimal adherence makes control of the epidemic elusive, considering that effective antiretroviral treatment and viral suppression are the two key pillars in reducing new infections. Psychological interventions have been proposed as effective treatments for the management of AUDs in PLWH. Evidence for their effectiveness has been inconsistent, with two reviews (2010 and 2013) concluding a lack of effectiveness. However, a 2017 review that examined multiple HIV prevention and treatment outcomes suggested that behavioural interventions were effective in reducing alcohol use. Since then, several studies have been published necessitating a re-examination of this evidence. This review provides an updated synthesis of the effectiveness of psychological interventions for AUDs in PLWH. A search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, PsychInfo (Ovid) and Clinical trials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov) for eligible studies until August 2018 for psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions for PLWH with AUDs. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts to select studies that met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction with any differences resolved through discussion. Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the concordance between the first and second reviewers was 0.63 and between the first and third reviewers 0.71. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials using psychological interventions in people aged 16 and above, with comparisons being usual care, enhanced usual care, other active treatments or waitlist controls. A total of 21 studies (6954 participants) were included in this review. Studies had diverse populations including men alone, men and women and men who had sex with men (MSM). Use of motivational interviewing alone or blended with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and technology/computer-assisted platforms were common as individual-level interventions, while a few studies investigated group motivational interviewing or CBT. Alcohol use outcomes were all self-report and included assessment of the quantity and the frequency of alcohol use. Measured secondary outcomes included viral load, CD4 count or other self-reported outcomes. There was a lack of evidence for significant intervention effects in the included studies. Isolated effects of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioural therapy and group therapy were noted. However for some of the studies that found significant effects, the effect sizes were small and not sustained over time. Owing to the variation in outcome measures employed across studies, no meta-analysis could be carried out. This systematic review did not reveal large or sustained intervention effects of psychological interventions for either primary alcohol use or secondary HIV-related outcomes. Due to the methodological heterogeneity, we were unable to undertake a meta-analysis. Effectiveness trials of psychological interventions for AUDs in PLWH that include disaggregation of data by level of alcohol consumption, gender and age are needed. There is a need to standardise alcohol use outcome measures across studies and include objective biomarkers that provide a more accurate measure of alcohol consumption and are relatively free from social desirability bias.

    "title": "The Cochrane 2018 Review on Brief Interventions in Primary Care for Hazardous and Harmful Alcohol Consumption: A Distillation for Clinicians and Policy Makers.",
    "abstract": "An updated Cochrane systematic review assessed effectiveness of screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in general practice or emergency care settings. This paper summarises the implications of the review for clinicians. Cochrane methods were followed. Reporting accords with PRISMA guidance. We searched multiple resources to September 2017, seeking randomised controlled trials of brief interventions to reduce hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people attending general practice, emergency care or other primary care settings for reasons other than alcohol treatment. Brief intervention was defined as a conversation comprising five or fewer sessions of brief advice or brief lifestyle counselling and a total duration of less than 60 min. Our primary outcome was alcohol consumption, measured as or convertible to grams per week. We conducted meta-analyses to assess change in consumption, and subgroup analyses to explore the impact of participant and intervention characteristics. We included 69 studies, of which 42 were added for this update. Most studies (88%) compared brief intervention to control. The primary meta-analysis included 34 studies and provided moderate-quality evidence that brief intervention reduced consumption compared to control after one year (mean difference -20 g/wk, 95% confidence interval -28 to -12). Subgroup analysis showed a similar effect for men and women. Brief interventions can reduce harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption in men and women. Short, advice-based interventions may be as effective as extended, counselling-based interventions for patients with harmful levels of alcohol use who are presenting for the first time in a primary care setting.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of brief alcohol interventions in primary care populations.",
    "abstract": "Excessive drinking is a significant cause of mortality, morbidity and social problems in many countries. Brief interventions aim to reduce alcohol consumption and related harm in hazardous and harmful drinkers who are not actively seeking help for alcohol problems. Interventions usually take the form of a conversation with a primary care provider and may include feedback on the person's alcohol use, information about potential harms and benefits of reducing intake, and advice on how to reduce consumption. Discussion informs the development of a personal plan to help reduce consumption. Brief interventions can also include behaviour change or motivationally-focused counselling.This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2007. To assess the effectiveness of screening and brief alcohol intervention to reduce excessive alcohol consumption in hazardous or harmful drinkers in general practice or emergency care settings. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and 12 other bibliographic databases to September 2017. We searched Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Science Database (to December 2003, after which the database was discontinued), trials registries, and websites. We carried out handsearching and checked reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of brief interventions to reduce hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people attending general practice, emergency care or other primary care settings for reasons other than alcohol treatment. The comparison group was no or minimal intervention, where a measure of alcohol consumption was reported. 'Brief intervention' was defined as a conversation comprising five or fewer sessions of brief advice or brief lifestyle counselling and a total duration of less than 60 minutes. Any more was considered an extended intervention. Digital interventions were not included in this review. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We carried out subgroup analyses where possible to investigate the impact of factors such as gender, age, setting (general practice versus emergency care), treatment exposure and baseline consumption. We included 69 studies that randomised a total of 33,642 participants. Of these, 42 studies were added for this update (24,057 participants). Most interventions were delivered in general practice (38 studies, 55%) or emergency care (27 studies, 39%) settings. Most studies (61 studies, 88%) compared brief intervention to minimal or no intervention. Extended interventions were compared with brief (4 studies, 6%), minimal or no intervention (7 studies, 10%). Few studies targeted particular age groups: adolescents or young adults (6 studies, 9%) and older adults (4 studies, 6%). Mean baseline alcohol consumption was 244 g/week (30.5 standard UK units) among the studies that reported these data. Main sources of bias were attrition and lack of provider or participant blinding. The primary meta-analysis included 34 studies (15,197 participants) and provided moderate-quality evidence that participants who received brief intervention consumed less alcohol than minimal or no intervention participants after one year (mean difference (MD) -20 g/week, 95% confidence interval (CI) -28 to -12). There was substantial heterogeneity among studies (I\u00b2 = 73%). A subgroup analysis by gender demonstrated that both men and women reduced alcohol consumption after receiving a brief intervention.We found moderate-quality evidence that brief alcohol interventions have little impact on frequency of binges per week (MD -0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.02; 15 studies, 6946 participants); drinking days per week (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.04; 11 studies, 5469 participants); or drinking intensity (-0.2 g/drinking day, 95% CI -3.1 to 2.7; 10 studies, 3128 participants).We found moderate-quality evidence of little difference in quantity of alcohol consumed when extended and no or minimal interventions were compared (-14 g/week, 95% CI -37 to 9; 6 studies, 1296 participants). There was little difference in binges per week (-0.08, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.12; 2 studies, 456 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or difference in days drinking per week (-0.45, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.09; 2 studies, 319 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Extended versus no or minimal intervention provided little impact on drinking intensity (9 g/drinking day, 95% CI -26 to 9; 1 study, 158 participants; low-quality evidence).Extended intervention had no greater impact than brief intervention on alcohol consumption, although findings were imprecise (MD 2 g/week, 95% CI -42 to 45; 3 studies, 552 participants; low-quality evidence). Numbers of binges were not reported for this comparison, but one trial suggested a possible drop in days drinking per week (-0.5, 95% CI -1.2 to 0.2; 147 participants; low-quality evidence). Results from this trial also suggested very little impact on drinking intensity (-1.7 g/drinking day, 95% CI -18.9 to 15.5; 147 participants; very low-quality evidence).Only five studies reported adverse effects (very low-quality evidence). No participants experienced any adverse effects in two studies; one study reported that the intervention increased binge drinking for women and two studies reported adverse events related to driving outcomes but concluded they were equivalent in both study arms.Sources of funding were reported by 67 studies (87%). With two exceptions, studies were funded by government institutes, research bodies or charitable foundations. One study was partly funded by a pharmaceutical company and a brewers association, another by a company developing diagnostic testing equipment. We found moderate-quality evidence that brief interventions can reduce alcohol consumption in hazardous and harmful drinkers compared to minimal or no intervention. Longer counselling duration probably has little additional effect. Future studies should focus on identifying the components of interventions which are most closely associated with effectiveness.",

    "title": "Personalised digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption in community-dwelling populations.",
    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol use contributes significantly to physical and psychological illness, injury and death, and a wide array of social harm in all age groups. A proven strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption levels is to offer a brief conversation-based intervention in primary care settings, but more recent technological innovations have enabled people to interact directly via computer, mobile device or smartphone with digital interventions designed to address problem alcohol consumption. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions for reducing hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, or both, in people living in the community, specifically: (i) Are digital interventions more effective and cost-effective than no intervention (or minimal input) controls? (ii) Are digital interventions at least equally effective as face-to-face brief alcohol interventions? (iii) What are the effective component behaviour change techniques (BCTs) of such interventions and their mechanisms of action? (iv) What theories or models have been used in the development and/or evaluation of the intervention? Secondary objectives were (i) to assess whether outcomes differ between trials where the digital intervention targets participants attending health, social care, education or other community-based settings and those where it is offered remotely via the internet or mobile phone platforms; (ii) to specify interventions according to their mode of delivery (e.g. functionality features) and assess the impact of mode of delivery on outcomes. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HTA and Web of Knowledge databases; ClinicalTrials.com and WHO ICTRP trials registers and relevant websites to April 2017. We also checked the reference lists of included trials and relevant systematic reviews. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of digital interventions compared with no intervention or with face-to-face interventions for reducing hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption in people living in the community and reported a measure of alcohol consumption. We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We included 57 studies which randomised a total of 34,390 participants. The main sources of bias were from attrition and participant blinding (36% and 21% of studies respectively, high risk of bias). Forty one studies (42 comparisons, 19,241 participants) provided data for the primary meta-analysis, which demonstrated that participants using a digital intervention drank approximately 23 g alcohol weekly (95% CI 15 to 30) (about 3 UK units) less than participants who received no or minimal interventions at end of follow up (moderate-quality evidence).Fifteen studies (16 comparisons, 10,862 participants) demonstrated that participants who engaged with digital interventions had less than one drinking day per month fewer than no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), 15 studies (3587 participants) showed about one binge drinking session less per month in the intervention group compared to no intervention controls (moderate-quality evidence), and in 15 studies (9791 participants) intervention participants drank one unit per occasion less than no intervention control participants (moderate-quality evidence).Only five small studies (390 participants) compared digital and face-to-face interventions. There was no difference in alcohol consumption at end of follow up (MD 0.52 g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63; low-quality evidence). Thus, digital alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes in these studies. No studies reported whether any adverse effects resulted from the interventions.A median of nine BCTs were used in experimental arms (range = 1 to 22). 'B' is an estimate of effect (MD in quantity of drinking, expressed in g/week) per unit increase in the BCT, and is a way to report whether individual BCTs are linked to the effect of the intervention. The BCTs of goal setting (B -43.94, 95% CI -78.59 to -9.30), problem solving (B -48.03, 95% CI -77.79 to -18.27), information about antecedents (B -74.20, 95% CI -117.72 to -30.68), behaviour substitution (B -123.71, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80) and credible source (B -39.89, 95% CI -72.66 to -7.11) were significantly associated with reduced alcohol consumption in unadjusted models. In a multivariable model that included BCTs with B > 23 in the unadjusted model, the BCTs of behaviour substitution (B -95.12, 95% CI -162.90 to -27.34), problem solving (B -45.92, 95% CI -90.97 to -0.87), and credible source (B -32.09, 95% CI -60.64 to -3.55) were associated with reduced alcohol consumption.The most frequently mentioned theories or models in the included studies were Motivational Interviewing Theory (7/20), Transtheoretical Model (6/20) and Social Norms Theory (6/20). Over half of the interventions (n = 21, 51%) made no mention of theory. Only two studies used theory to select participants or tailor the intervention. There was no evidence of an association between reporting theory use and intervention effectiveness. There is moderate-quality evidence that digital interventions may lower alcohol consumption, with an average reduction of up to three (UK) standard drinks per week compared to control participants. Substantial heterogeneity and risk of performance and publication bias may mean the reduction was lower. Low-quality evidence from fewer studies suggested there may be little or no difference in impact on alcohol consumption between digital and face-to-face interventions.The BCTs of behaviour substitution, problem solving and credible source were associated with the effectiveness of digital interventions to reduce alcohol consumption and warrant further investigation in an experimental context.Reporting of theory use was very limited and often unclear when present. Over half of the interventions made no reference to any theories. Limited reporting of theory use was unrelated to heterogeneity in intervention effectiveness.",

    "title": "Meta-analysis on the effectiveness of alcohol screening with brief interventions for patients in emergency care settings.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nDespite ambiguous evidence for the effectiveness of alcohol screening with brief interventions (BI) in emergency departments (ED), ambition for their widespread implementation continues to grow. To clarify whether such an application of BI is justifiable, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies testing the impact of BI on alcohol consumption.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included peer-reviewed, randomized controlled studies investigating the effects of BI on alcohol consumption in injured and/or intoxicated patients, published January 2002-September 2015. Changes from baseline in consumption quantity, intensity and number of heavy drinking episodes were assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up, resulting in nine separate random-effects meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD). Moderation effects of intervention mode, length, type of interventionist, intensity of control intervention and study quality were assessed using subgroup comparisons and meta-regression.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe considered 33 publications (28 separate studies) including 14 456 patients. Six of nine comparisons revealed small significant effects in favour of BI, with the highest SMD at 0.19 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08-0.31]. No significant moderators could be identified, and statistical heterogeneity (I(2) ) was below 40%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a large meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in emergency care settings, there was evidence for very small effects of brief interventions on alcohol consumption reductions. More intensive interventions showed no benefit over shorter approaches. Non-face-to-face interventions appear to be comparably effective, but this finding remains tentative due to the low number of non-face-to-face studies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nAlcohol screening, brief intervention (BI), and referral to treatment is often considered stepped care, such that BI with referral links patients to treatment. A meta-analysis of randomized trials found no evidence that BI increases treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study aimed to determine whether BI is associated with receipt of treatment for AUD among patients receiving BI as part of routine care.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRegression analysis.\n\n\nSETTING\nU.S. Veterans Health Administration (VA), in which BI is supported by performance measurement and electronic clinical reminders.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nVA outpatients with positive Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption screens (\u22655) (n=830,825) documented nationally 10/01/09-5/30/13.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nRegression models estimated prevalence of receiving VA specialty addictions treatment within 0-365 days for patients with documented BI (advice to reduce/abstain within 0-14 days) compared with those without.

Multiple secondary analyses assessed robustness of findings, including assessing repeated BI as a predictor.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nAmong 830,825 VA outpatients with unhealthy alcohol use (1,172,606 positive screens), documented BI was associated with lower likelihood of receiving VA specialty addictions treatment (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.83-0.84). Associations were similar for those with and without AUD (aIRR 0.83, 0.82-0.84 and 0.86, 0.83-0.88, respectively) and in most secondary analyses. However, among patients without AUD, documentation of >1 BI was associated with greater likelihood of treatment relative to no BI (aIRR 1.75, 1.68-1.83).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a national sample of U.S. Veterans Health Administration patients with unhealthy alcohol use, documented brief intervention for alcohol use was associated with lower likelihood of receiving specialty addictions treatment regardless of alcohol use disorder diagnosis.",

    "title": "Can alcohol consumption in Germany be reduced by alcohol screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment in primary health care? Results of a simulation study",
    "abstract": "Background Screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a programme to reduce alcohol consumption for drinkers with high alcohol consumption levels. Only 2.9% of patients in primary health care (PHC) are screened for their alcohol use in Germany, despite high levels of alcohol consumption and attributable harm. We developed an open-access simulation model to estimate the impact of higher SBIRT delivery rates in German PHC settings on population-level alcohol consumption. Methods and findings A hypothetical population of drinkers and non-drinkers was simulated by sex, age, and educational status for the year 2009 based on survey and sales data. Risky drinking persons receiving BI or RT were sampled from this population based on screening coverage and other parameters. Running the simulation model for a ten-year period, drinking levels and heavy episodic drinking (HED) status were changed based on effect sizes from meta-analyses. In the baseline scenario of 2.9% screening coverage, 2.4% of the adult German population received a subsequent intervention between 2009 and 2018. If every second PHC patient would have been screened for alcohol use, 21% of adult residents in Germany would have received BI or RT by the end of the ten-year simulation period. In this scenario, population-level alcohol consumption would be 12% lower than it was in 2018, without any impact on HED prevalence. Screening coverage rates below 10% were not found to have a measurable effect on drinking levels. Conclusions Large-scale implementation of SBIRT in PHC settings can yield substantial reductions of alcohol consumption in Germany. As high screening coverage rates may only be achievable in the long run, other effective alcohol policies are required to achieve short-term reduction of alcohol use and attributable harm in Germany. There is large potential to apply this open-access simulation model to other settings and for other alcohol interventions.",

    "title": "Attitudes and current practice in alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral for treatment among staff working in urgent and emergency settings: An open, cross-sectional international survey",
    "abstract": "Background The aim of the study was to ascertain the views and experiences of those working in urgent and emergency care (UEC) settings towards screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol, to inform future practice. Objectives To explore i) views towards health promotion, ii) views towards and practice of SBIRT, iii) facilitators and barriers to delivering SBIRT, iv) training needs to support future SBIRT practice, and v) comparisons in views and attitudes between demographic characteristics, geographical regions, setting and occupational groups. Methods This was an open cross-sectional international survey, using an online self-administered questionnaire with closed and open-ended responses. Participants were \u226518 years of age, from any occupational group, working in urgent and emergency care (UEC) settings in any country or region. Results There were 362 respondents (aged 21\u201365 years, 87.8% shift workers) from 7 occupational groups including physicians (48.6%), nurses (22.4%) and advanced clinical practitioners (18.5%). Most believed that health promotion is part of their role, and that SBIRT for alcohol prevention is needed and appropriate in UEC settings. SBIRT was seen to be acceptable to patients. 66% currently provide brief alcohol advice, but fewer screen for alcohol problems or make alcohol-related referrals. The most common barriers were high workload and lack of funding for prevention, lack of knowledge and training on SBIRT, lack of access to high-quality resources, lack of timely referral pathways, and concerns about patient resistance to advice. Some views and attitudes varied according to demographic characteristics, occupation, setting or region. Conclusions UEC workers are willing to engage in SBIRT for alcohol prevention but there are challenges to implementation in UEC environments and concerns about workload impacts on already-burdened staff, particularly in the context of global workforce shortages. UEC workers advocate for clear guidelines and policies, increased staff capacity and/or dedicated health promotion teams onsite, SBIRT education/training/resources, appropriate physical spaces for SBIRT conversations and improved alcohol referral pathways to better funded services. Implementation of SBIRT could contribute to improving population health and reducing service demand, but it requires significant and sustained commitment of time and resources for prevention across healthcare organisations.",

    "title": "Inpatient Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder in Patients Admitted with Alcohol-associated Liver Disease Is Not Universally Implemented in Practice, But Can Reduce Readmissions for Alcohol-associated Hepatitis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The management of alcohol-related liver disease requires a multidisciplinary approach to treat alcohol use disorder. We aimed to determine the proportion of actively drinking patients admitted for alcohol-associated hepatitis (AAH) or decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis (DARLC) who were offered or underwent screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol use disorder during admission and if inpatient SBIRT is associated with reduced readmissions for alcohol-related liver disease. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of actively drinking patients admitted to our institution from January 2017 to December 2021 with AAH or DARLC. Logistic regression was used to identify factors, such as conducting SBIRT, that were associated with 30-day and 90-day readmissions for recurrent AAH or DARLC. Results There were 120 AAH admissions (mean age 47.7 \u00b1 13.6 years), and 177 DARLC admissions (mean age 58.2 \u00b1 9.5 years). SBIRT was conducted in only 51.7% of AAH admissions, and 23.7% of DARLC admissions. For AAH, conducting SBIRT was associated with significantly reduced 30-day (OR 0.098, P = 0.001, 95% CI 0.024\u20130.408) and 90-day (OR 0.166, P = 0.003, 95% CI 0.052\u20130.534) readmissions. For DARLC, there was no association between conducting SBIRT and 30-day or 90-day readmissions. Conclusion SBIRT was conducted with actively drinking patients in only 51.7% of AAH admissions and 23.7% of DARLC admissions. Patients admitted for AAH who received inpatient SBIRT had decreased 30-day and 90-day readmission rates for AAH or DARLC.",

    "title": "Alcohol Prevention in Urgent and Emergency Care (APUEC): Development and Evaluation of Workforce Digital Training on Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment",
    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol consumption carries a significant health, social and economic burden. Screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is one approach to identifying patients with excessive alcohol consumption and providing interventions to help them reduce their drinking. However, healthcare workers in urgent and emergency care settings do not routinely integrate SBIRT into clinical practice and raise a lack of training as a barrier to SBIRT delivery. Therefore, \u201cAlcohol Prevention in Urgent and Emergency Care\u201d (APUEC) training was developed, delivered, and evaluated. APUEC is a brief, stand-alone, multimedia, interactive digital training package for healthcare workers. The aim of APUEC is to increase positive attitudes, knowledge, confidence and skills related to SBIRT through the provision of (a) education on the impact of alcohol and the role of urgent and emergency care in alcohol prevention, and (b) practical guidance on patient assessment, delivery of brief advice and making referral decisions. Development involved collaborative\u2013participatory design approaches and a rigorous six-step ASPIRE methodology (involving n = 28 contributors). APUEC was delivered to healthcare workers who completed an online survey (n = 18) and then participated in individual qualitative interviews (n = 15). Analysis of data was aligned with Levels 1\u20133 of the Kirkpatrick Model of Training Evaluation. Survey data showed that all participants (100%) found the training useful and would recommend it to others. Insights from the qualitative data showed that APUEC digital training increases healthcare workers\u2019 perceived knowledge, confidence and skills related to alcohol prevention in urgent and emergency care settings. Participants viewed APUEC to be engaging and relevant to urgent and emergency care workers. This digital training was perceived to be useful for workforce skills development and supporting the implementation of SBIRT in clinical practice. While the impact of APUEC on clinician behaviour and patient outcomes is yet to be tested, APUEC digital training could easily be embedded within education and continuing professional development programmes for healthcare workers and healthcare trainees of any discipline. Ultimately, this may facilitate the integration of SBIRT into routine care and contribute to population health improvement.",

    "title": "A Structural Equation Modeling Approach to Meta-analytic Mediation Analysis Using Individual Participant Data: Testing Protective Behavioral Strategies as a Mediator of Brief Motivational Intervention Effects on Alcohol-Related Problems",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a meta-analytic mediation analysis approach for individual participant data (IPD) from multiple studies. Mediation analysis evaluates whether the effectiveness of an intervention on health outcomes occurs because of change in a key behavior targeted by the intervention. However, individual trials are often statistically underpowered to test mediation hypotheses. Existing approaches for evaluating mediation in the meta-analytic context are limited by their reliance on aggregate data; thus, findings may be confounded with study-level differences unrelated to the pathway of interest. To overcome the limitations of existing meta-analytic mediation approaches, we used a one-stage estimation approach using structural equation modeling (SEM) to combine IPD from multiple studies for mediation analysis. This approach (1) accounts for the clustering of participants within studies, (2) accommodates missing data via multiple imputation, and (3) allows valid inferences about the indirect (i.e., mediated) effects via bootstrapped confidence intervals. We used data (N\u2009=\u20093691 from 10 studies) from Project INTEGRATE (Mun et al. Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, 29, 34\u201348, 2015) to illustrate the SEM approach to meta-analytic mediation analysis by testing whether improvements in the use of protective behavioral strategies mediate the effectiveness of brief motivational interventions for alcohol-related problems among college students. To facilitate the application of the methodology, we provide annotated computer code in R and data for replication. At a substantive level, stand-alone personalized feedback interventions reduced alcohol-related problems via greater use of protective behavioral strategies; however, the net-mediated effect across strategies was small in size, on average.",

    "title": "Brief Alcohol Interventions are Effective through 6 Months: Findings from Marginalized Zero-inflated Poisson and Negative Binomial Models in a Two-step IPD Meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "To evaluate and optimize brief alcohol interventions (BAIs), it is critical to have a credible overall effect size estimate as a benchmark. Estimating such an effect size has been challenging because alcohol outcomes often represent responses from a mixture of individuals: those at high risk for alcohol misuse, occasional nondrinkers, and abstainers. Moreover, some BAIs exclusively focus on heavy drinkers, whereas others take a universal prevention approach. Depending on sample characteristics, the outcome distribution might have many zeros or very few zeros and overdispersion; consequently, the most appropriate statistical model may differ across studies. We synthesized individual participant data (IPD) from 19 studies in Project INTEGRATE (Mun et al., 2015b ) that randomly allocated participants to intervention and control groups ( N = 7,704 participants, 38.4% men, 74.7% White, 58.5% first-year students). We sequentially estimated marginalized zero-inflated Poisson (Long et al., 2014 ) or negative binomial regression models to obtain covariate-adjusted, study-specific intervention effect estimates in the first step, which were subsequently combined in a random-effects meta-analysis model in the second step. BAIs produced a statistically significant 8% advantage in the mean number of drinks at both 1\u20133 months ( RR = 0.92,\u00a095% CI = [0.85, 0.98]) and 6 months ( RR = 0.92,\u00a095% CI = [0.85,\u00a00.99]) compared to controls. At 9\u201312 months, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of drinks between BAIs and controls. In conclusion, BAIs are effective at reducing the mean number of drinks through at least 6 months post intervention. IPD can play a critical role in deriving findings that could not be obtained in original individual studies or standard aggregate data meta-analyses.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the effect on postoperative complications of combined prehabilitation targeting predefined co-existing risky SNAP factors with usual preoperative routines in surgical patients. This systematic review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and the protocol (CRD42022282611). Five databases were searched from inception to November 7, 2022 for randomised controlled trials on prehabilitation targeting \u22652 predefined risky lifestyles compared with usual preoperative routines. Risky lifestyles included Smoking, Nutrition (malnutrition and/or BMI>25), risky Alcohol intake, and Physical inactivity (SNAP). Primary outcome was postoperative complications \u226430 days. Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool 2 was used and meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. The search resulted in 20,862 records. At full-text screening, only two (120 participants) of 24 identified trials on combined SNAP intervention had \u22652 predefined risk factors and were included. One (n=110) on intensive physical and brief nutritional intervention to frail patients with colorectal cancer resection reported complication rates of 45% in both groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51). The other study (n=10, subgroup) on intensive alcohol and smoking intervention in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, reported complications in 3/7 vs 3/3 participants. The meta-analysis estimated a RR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.51, I  Two small of the 24 trials on prehabilitation targeted co-existing and predefined risky SNAP factors and the effect on postoperative complications is very uncertain.

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Electronic Screening and Brief Intervention (e-SBI) in changing or reducing alcohol consumption and/or related risk behaviours among trauma patients compared to standard of care. Following Cochrane Collaboration's guidelines and PRISMA recommendations, a search of electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science) and grey literature (Google Scholar) was conducted. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from 1995 to 2023 were included, focusing on e-SBI for alcohol misuse in trauma patients. Quality assessment utilised the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Bayesian meta-analysis was employed for synthesising outcomes. Four RCTs, totalling 2641 participants, were included. While e-SBI demonstrated a significant reduction in problematic alcohol consumption up to 6\u2009months post-implementation, uncertainties were noted in risk behaviours determined by: average alcohol consumption, binge drinking and alcohol-related consequences. Heterogeneity in measurements and population variations contributed to the nuanced findings. The review suggests that e-SBI may be effective in reducing problematic alcohol consumption in the short term among alcohol-related trauma patients. However, uncertainties and methodological variations highlight the need for standardised outcome measurements, consistent reporting and further exploration of e-SBI's long-term impact. Relevance to health promotion: Understanding the effectiveness of e-SBI in managing alcohol-related issues among trauma patients is crucial for health promotion. Despite uncertainties, the findings underscore the potential of e-SBI as a scalable and accessible intervention. e-SBI in the setting of the present study, emphasises the importance of tailored approaches in public health strategies.",

    "abstract": "This meta-review aimed to summarize the current state of knowledge provided by meta-analyzes on the efficacy of psychotherapies for substance use disorders. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Meta-analyzes were included if they quantitatively examined the efficacy of a psychotherapy on substance use. Among the 6866 potential articles that were screened for eligibility, 23 meta-analyzes were eligible (78 effect sizes). Each meta-analysis included 2-156 studies, with samples ranging between approximately 130 to over 33,000 individuals. The quality of evidence was evaluated as being globally of low to moderate quality. Substances were categorized as: alcohol (k\u00a0=\u00a012), cannabis (k\u00a0=\u00a07), stimulants (k\u00a0=\u00a04), opioids (k\u00a0=\u00a03) and benzodiazepines (k\u00a0=\u00a01). Interventions comprised brief intervention, cognitive-behavioral therapy, contingency management, voucher-based reinforcement therapy, motivational interview, motivational enhancement therapy, significant other people involved in the treatment, and cue-expose therapy. Concerning solely significant results, small benefits were observed for significant other people involved in treatment, motivational interviewing, and the combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy with motivational interviewing for alcohol use disorder. Likewise, small-to-moderate effects were found for motivational approaches, and cognitive-behavioral therapy as well as the combination of cognitive-behavioral therapy and motivational enhancement therapy in the case of cannabis use disorder. Small effects were observed for contingency management as well as cognitive behavioral-therapy for amphetamine-type use disorder. Small effects were similarly found for contingency management for cocaine use disorder. Concerning opioid use disorder, moderate effects were observed for contingency management and voucher-based reinforcement intervention. For benzodiazepine use disorder, small effects were noted for cognitive-behavioral therapy with taper. Results often displayed small to moderate heterogeneity when reported and were generally compared to inactive controls, such as treatment-as-usual. In all, the psychosocial treatments for substance use disorders included in this meta-review have shown to be at best moderately effective over inactive controls in the short term. Nevertheless, further trials are needed as well as meta-analyzes on interventions not included in this meta-review.",

    "abstract": "Urgent and emergency care (UEC) settings provide an opportunity to prevent ill-health and promote healthy lifestyles with potential to screen and deliver interventions to under-served, at-risk populations. The aim of this study was to synthesise and summarise the evidence on the effectiveness and implementation of interventions for health promotion in UEC settings. PubMed and Embase (OVID) databases were used to search for studies published in English between January 2010 and January 2023. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that examined the effectiveness or implementation of face-to-face health promotion interventions for lifestyle behaviours delivered in UEC settings were eligible. Extracted data were synthesised and qualitatively summarised by lifestyle behaviour. Reviews were quality assessed using AMSTAR 2. Eighteen reviews met the inclusion criteria; all included studies were conducted in emergency departments or trauma units. We identified 15 reviews on alcohol interventions (13 on effectiveness; 2 on implementation) and 3 on smoking interventions (effectiveness). There were no reviews of intervention studies targeting physical activity or diet and nutrition. There was heterogeneity across studies for study design, target populations, intervention design and content, comparator/control groups and outcomes assessed. The effectiveness of alcohol and smoking interventions in UEC settings varied but some reviews provided evidence of a significant decrease in alcohol consumption, alcohol-related outcomes and smoking in intervention groups, particularly in the short-term and in specific population groups. Research has focused on 'brief' interventions as part of screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) approaches. Interventions are delivered by a wide range of staff with substantial variation in design. Alcohol brief interventions appear to be acceptable to UEC patients but clinicians face barriers in delivering them. UEC settings have been under-researched and appear to be under-utilised for delivering health promotion activities, except for alcohol prevention. Review level evidence suggests alcohol and smoking interventions are warranted in some population groups. However, further research is needed to determine the optimal intervention design, content and delivery mode for lifestyle behaviours which are suitable for implementation in UEC settings and promote long-term intervention effectiveness. Changes in clinical practice may be needed, including increased training, integration into service delivery and supportive policy, to facilitate the implementation of SBIRT for lifestyle behaviours. Interventions may need to be delivered in the wider UEC system such as urgent care centres, minor injury units and walk-in centres, in addition to emergency departments and trauma units, to support and increase health promotion activities in UEC settings.",

We also estimated the standardized mean difference in alcohol consumption per day before and after intervention. We included a total of 8 studies; 5 of these were included in the meta-analysis, and all were reviewed for narrative synthesis. We observed a significant change in the pre-post brief intervention substance risk scores with a medium effect size (Hedges g = 0.752, 95% confidence interval, 0.405-1.099). Sensitivity analyses with different pretest-posttest correlations did not change our result. Modest effects of SBI were found in reducing both alcohol and illicit drug risk scores, and among the population on methadone and buprenorphine treatment. We also observed a significant decrease in alcohol consumption per day 3 months after SBI.

While varied interventions have been shown to reduce alcohol use in high-income countries, their efficacy in LMICs has not been assessed. This systematic review describes current published literature on patient-level alcohol interventions in LMICs and specifically describes clinical trials evaluating interventions to reduce alcohol use in LMICs. In accordance with PRISMA, we performed a systematic review using an electronic search strategy from January 1, 1995 to December 1, 2020. Title, abstract, as well as full-text screening and extraction were performed in duplicate. A meta-summary was performed on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated alcohol-related outcomes. We searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, WHO Global Health Library, and PsycINFO. Articles that evaluated patient-level interventions targeting alcohol use and alcohol-related harm in LMICs were eligible for inclusion. No studies were excluded based on language. After screening 5,036 articles, 117 articles fit our inclusion criteria, 75 of which were RCTs. Of these RCTs, 93% were performed in 13 middle-income countries, while 7% were from 2 low-income countries. These RCTs evaluated brief interventions (24, defined as any intervention ranging from advice to counseling, lasting less than 1 hour per session up to 4 sessions), psychotherapy or counseling (15, defined as an interaction with a counselor longer than a brief intervention or that included a psychotherapeutic component), health promotion and education (20, defined as an intervention encouraged individuals' agency of taking care of their health), or biologic treatments (19, defined as interventions where the biological function of alcohol use disorder (AUD) as the main nexus of intervention) with 3 mixing categories of intervention types. Due to high heterogeneity of intervention types, outcome measures, and follow-up times, we did not conduct meta-analysis to compare and contrast studies, but created a meta-summary of all 75 RCT studies. The most commonly evaluated intervention with the most consistent positive effect was a brief intervention; similarly, motivational interviewing (MI) techniques were most commonly utilized among the diverse array of interventions evaluated. Our review demonstrated numerous patient-level interventions that have the potential to be effective in LMICs, but further research to standardize interventions, populations, and outcome measures is necessary to accurately assess their effectiveness. Brief interventions and MI techniques were the most commonly evaluated and had the most consistent positive effect on alcohol-related outcomes. Protocol Registry: PROSPERO CRD42017055549.",

    "abstract": "Given the high prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) amongst patients in Emergency Rooms (ER), it is recommended to carry out a systematized screening of at-risk drinkers, followed if necessary by a brief intervention (BI) to prevent AUD-related damages. This intervention has been the subject of numerous efficacy and feasibility studies. The purpose of this review of the literature is to identify optimal strategies for systematic screening and BI that can be deployed in the ER. We selected randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis and reviews of the literature published between July 2014 and March 2019 evaluating the effectiveness of BI in the ER on reducing alcohol consumption. Thirteen articles were included. There is a significant heterogeneity of the methodologies used and the interventions carried out. The majority of studies conclude in the effectiveness of BI on reducing alcohol consumption, with however differences between the studies in effect size, and an effectiveness that seems to decrease over time. The BI in the ER appears to be effective on reducing alcohol consumption but with a modest effect size and heterogeneity of the interventions tested, so that the optimal modalities of its implementation remain to be defined. Further studies to compare different interventions and identify at-risk subgroups would be needed to optimize the use of BI in the ER.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review summarizes and critically appraises the existing literature on brief interventions (BIs) for cannabis use among emerging adults. Eligible BIs were operationalized as 1-2 sessions focused exclusively on cannabis use for samples with mean ages between 15 and 30. Outcomes related to cannabis use, other substance use, mental health, help-seeking, or functional status were included. Two independent reviewers screened a total of 3638 records, identifying 244 studies for full-text screening. In total, 32 BIs in 26 primary studies with 6318 participants were included. Participants were typically not seeking treatment and using cannabis at least once a month. Most interventions were motivational, single sessions, and delivered in person. Few discussed concurrent psychiatric conditions. Pooling results at 1-3 months post-intervention, BIs compared to passive control slightly reduced symptoms of cannabis use disorder (SMD -0.14 [95% CI -0.26 to -0.01]) and increased the odds of abstinence (OR 1.73 [95% CI 1.13-2.66]). Other outcome results often favored BIs but were not significant. Results of studies comparing types of BIs (k\u202f=\u202f8) or BIs to longer interventions (k\u202f=\u202f1) are discussed narratively. Quality assessment suggested low to very low-quality evidence. This review indicates that BIs targeting non-treatment seeking emerging adults result in significant reductions in symptoms of cannabis use disorder and an increased likelihood of cannabis abstinence, however evidence is of low quality.",

    "abstract": "Background: A minority of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorders (AUD) receive any type of formal treatment. Developing options for AUD treatment within primary care settings is imperative to increase treatment access. A multi-faceted implementation intervention including provider and patient education, clinician reminders, development of local champions and ongoing facilitation was designed to enhance access to AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care settings at three large Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. This qualitative study compared pre-implementation barriers to post-implementation barriers identified via provider interviews to identify those barriers addressed and not addressed by the intervention to better understand the limited impact of the intervention. Methods: Following the nine-month implementation period, primary care providers at the three participating facilities took part in qualitative interviews to collect perceptions regarding which pre-implementation barriers had and had not been successfully addressed by the intervention. Participants included 20 primary care providers from three large VHA facilities. Interviews were coded using common coding techniques for qualitative data using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) codebook. Summary reports were created for each CFIR construct for each facility and the impact of each CFIR construct on implementation was coded as positive, neutral, or negative. Results: Some barriers identified during pre-implementation interviews were no longer identified as barriers in the post-implementation interviews. These included Relative Advantage, Relative Priority, and Knowledge & Beliefs about the Innovation. However, Compatibility, Design Quality & Packaging, and Available Resources remained barriers at the end of the implementation period. No substantial new barriers were identified. Conclusions: The implementation intervention appears to have been successful at addressing barriers that could be mitigated with traditional educational approaches. However, the intervention did not adequately address structural and organizational barriers to implementation. Recommendations for enhancing future interventions are provided.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOnly 7.8\u00a0% of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive treatment in a given year. Most individuals with AUDs are identified in primary care (PC) settings and referred to substance use disorders (SUD) clinics; however, only a minority of those referred attend treatment services. Safe and effective pharmacological treatments for AUD exist, but they are rarely prescribed by PC providers. The objective of this study is to refine, implement, and evaluate an intervention to integrate pharmacological AUD treatment options into PC settings. This paper provides a detailed description of the intervention design and the evaluation components.Methods/designThree large Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities are participating in the intervention. The intervention targets stakeholder groups with tailored strategies based on implementation theory and prior research identifying barriers to implementation of AUD pharmacotherapy. Local SUD providers and primary care mental health integration (PCMHI) providers are trained to serve as local implementation/clinical champions and receive external facilitation. PC providers receive access to consultation from local and national clinical champions, educational materials, and a dashboard of patients with AUD on their caseloads for case identification. Veterans with AUD diagnoses receive educational information in the mail just prior to a scheduled PC visit. Effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated through an interrupted time series with matched controls to monitor change in facility level AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rates. Following Stetler\u2019s four-phase formative evaluation (FE) strategy, FE methods include (1) developmental FE (pre-implementation interviews with champions, PC providers, and Veterans), (2) implementation-focused FE (tracking attendance at facilitation meetings, academic detailing efforts by local champions, and patient dashboard utilization), (3) progress-focused FE (tracking rates of AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing and rates of referral to PCMHI and SUD specialty care), and (4) interpretive FE (post-implementation interviews with champions and PC providers). Analysis of FE data will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).DiscussionIf demonstrated to be successful, this implementation strategy will provide a replicable, feasible, and relative low-cost method for integrating AUD treatment services into PC settings, thereby increasing access to AUD treatment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the high prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs), in 2016, only 7.8% of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria received any type of AUD treatment. Developing options for treatment within primary care settings is imperative to increase treatment access. As part of a trial to implement AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care settings, this qualitative study analyzed pre-implementation provider interviews using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to identify implementation barriers.MethodsThree large Veterans Health Administration facilities participated in the implementation intervention. Local providers were trained to serve as implementation/clinical champions and received external facilitation from the project team. Primary care providers received a dashboard of patients with AUD for case identification, educational materials, and access to consultation from clinical champions. Veterans with AUD diagnoses received educational information in the mail. Prior to the start of implementation activities, 24 primary care providers (5\u201310 per site) participated in semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using common coding techniques for qualitative data using the CFIR codebook Innovation/Intervention Characteristics, Outer Setting, Inner Setting, and Characteristics of Individuals domains. Number and type of barriers identified were compared to quantitative changes in AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rates.ResultsFour major barriers emerged across all three sites: complexity of providing AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care, the limited compatibility of AUD treatment with existing primary care processes, providers\u2019 limited knowledge and negative beliefs about AUD pharmacotherapy and providers\u2019 negative attitudes toward patients with AUD. Site specific barriers included lack of relative advantage of providing AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care over current practice, complaints about the design quality and packaging of implementation intervention materials, limited priority of addressing AUD in primary care and limited available resources to implement AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care.ConclusionsCFIR constructs were useful for identifying pre-implementation barriers that informed refinements to the implementation intervention. The number and type of pre-implementation barriers identified did not demonstrate a clear relationship to the degree to which sites were able to improve AUD pharmacotherapy prescribing rate. Site-level implementation process factors such as leadership support and provider turn-over likely also interacted with pre-implementation barriers to drive implementation outcomes.",

Herein, we provide practical pharmacotherapy strategies to improve treatment outcome for AUD. We review the efficacy and side effects of both on- and off-label agents with a particular focus on clinical applicability.

    "abstract": "Background\nAlcohol use disorder (AUD) is a leading cause of cirrhosis. Insufficient clinician knowledge and comfort managing AUD impacts access to treatment. Using Kern's Framework for Curriculum Development, we aimed to (i) develop and evaluate the effect of an \"AUD in cirrhosis\" educational intervention on clinicians' knowledge, attitudes, comfort, preparedness, and intention (practice habits) to integrate AUD management into their practice, and (ii) assess clinicians' motivation using Self Determination Theory.\n\n\nMethods\nKern's approach was used for curriculum development. Pilot session feedback informed a three-part flipped-classroom series conducted by interdisciplinary clinicians in hepatology, psychiatry, primary care, and addiction psychology. Participants watched a video followed by a live session focused on (a) withdrawal, (b) screening and brief intervention, and (c) prescribing pharmacotherapy. Questionnaires assessing knowledge and practice habits were adapted from the literature. Attitudes were evaluated using the Short Alcohol and Alcohol Problems Perception Questionnaire (SAAPPQ). Self Determination Theory informed motivation questions.\n\n\nResults\nPaired sample t-tests on pre-post questionnaires (n = 229 clinicians; 95 completed questionnaires) revealed significant improvements in preparedness and comfort screening, providing a brief intervention, prescribing pharmacotherapy, and SAAPPQ domains. No significant changes were observed in the intention to prescribe pharmacotherapy. Effect size analysis showed medium to large effects across most topic areas.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe developed sessions improved knowledge, attitudes, and practice habits of clinicians caring for this patient population. Given the rise in AUD and significant consequences in cirrhosis, this data offers promise that interactive education may improve practice habits of clinicians interfacing with this patient population.",

    "title": "Kratom as a potential substance use disorder harm reduction agent",
    "abstract": "Substance use disorders contribute to considerable U.S. morbidity and mortality. While effective pharmacotherapy options are available to treat opioid and alcohol use disorders, for a variety of reasons, many patients lack access to treatment or may be reluctant to seek care due to concerns such as perceived stigma or a current lack of desire to completely curtail their substance use. Furthermore, treatment options are limited for patients with stimulant or polysubstance use disorders. Thus, there is considerable need to expand the substance use disorder harm reduction armamentarium. Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) is an herbal substance that can produce both opioid and stimulant-like effects, and its use in the US is growing. Though there are concerns regarding adverse effects, dependence risk, and limited regulation of its manufacturing and sale, the pharmacology of kratom and early preclinical studies suggest a potential role as a harm reduction agent for various substance use disorders, and it has historically been used in Southeast Asia for such purposes. The goal of this review is to describe kratom\u2019s history of use, pharmacology, and early pre-clinical and observational research regarding its therapeutic potential in opioid use disorder, as well as alcohol, stimulant, and polysubstance use disorders, while also highlighting current concerns around its use, existing gaps in the literature, and directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nUnhealthy drinking is a leading threat to health, yet few people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) receive treatment. This pilot tested the feasibility of addiction medicine video consultations in primary care for improving AUD medication adoption and specialty treatment initiation.\n\n\nMETHODS\nPrimary care providers (PCPs) received training and access to on-call addiction medicine consultations. Feasibility measures were training attendance, intention to use the service and/or AUD pharmacotherapy, and user feedback. Secondary outcomes were utilization, prescription and treatment initiation rates, and case reports. \u03c7 tests were used to compare prescription and treatment initiation rates for consult recipients and non-recipients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNinety-one PCPs (71.1%) attended a training, and 60 (65.9%) provided feedback. Of those, 37 (64.9%) mentioned pharmacotherapy and 41 (71.9%) intended to use the video consult service. Of 27 users, 19 provided feedback; 12 (63.1%) rated its value at 8 or above, on a scale of 1 to 10 (average 6.9). The most useful aspect was immediacy, and users wanted an easier workflow and increased consultant availability. Of 32 patients who received a consult, 11 (34.4%) were prescribed naltrexone, versus 43 (6.4%) of non-recipients (P\u200a<\u200a0.0001); 11 (34.4%) initiated specialty treatment, versus 105 (19.7%) of non-recipients (P\u200a<\u200a0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPCP training attendance and feedback suggest that an addiction telemedicine consult service would be valuable to PCPs and might increase AUD medication uptake and specialty addiction treatment initiation. However, future research should include significant modifications to the piloted telemedicine model: robust staffing and simpler, more flexible methods for PCPs to obtain consults.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: The opioid addiction and overdose crisis continues to ravage communities across the U.S. Maintenance pharmacotherapy using buprenorphine or methadone is the most effective intervention for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), yet few have immediate and sustained access to these medications. Objectives: To address lack of medication access for people with OUD, the Missouri Department of Mental Health began implementing a Medication First (Med First) treatment approach in its publicly-funded system of comprehensive substance use disorder treatment programs. Methods: This Perspective describes the four principles of Med First, which are based on evidence-based guidelines. It draws conceptual comparisons between the Housing First approach to chronic homelessness and the Med First approach to pharmacotherapy for OUD, and compares state certification standards for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment (the traditional approach) to Med First guidelines for OUD treatment. Finally, the Perspective details how Med First principles have been practically implemented. Results: Med First principles emphasize timely access to maintenance pharmacotherapy without requiring psychosocial services or discontinuation for any reason other than harm to the client. Early results regarding medication utilization and treatment retention are promising. Feedback from providers has been largely favorable, though clinical- and system-level obstacles to effective OUD treatment remain. Conclusion: Like the Housing First model, Medication First is designed to decrease human suffering and activate the strengths and capacities of people in need. It draws on decades of research and facilitates partnerships between psychosocial and medical treatment providers to offer effective and life-saving care to persons with OUD.",

    "abstract": "American military veterans have higher rates of psychiatric disorders, and timely access to high-quality mental health treatment in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is a persistent challenge. Integrated primary care (IPC) is one of many strategies implemented by VHA to increase access to care. IPC, including collaborative care and primary care behavioral health services, successfully increases access to initial behavioral health services in primary care (e.g., brief psychotherapies, pharmacotherapy) and continued engagement in specialty mental health services. IPC components that drive increased access include population-based care, response to patient preferences, and team-based care. The state of the evidence for IPC interventions for common behavioral health concerns in primary care (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol use, tobacco use, and insomnia) is reviewed, with areas for future research and implementation discussed, including how technology can assist IPC services and the importance of incorporating evidence-based psychotherapies into IPC.",

    "title": "Effects of systemic glycine on accumbal glycine and dopamine levels and ethanol intake in male Wistar rats",
    "abstract": "Approved medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) display modest effect sizes. Pharmacotherapy aimed at the mechanism(s) by which ethanol activates the dopamine reward pathway may offer improved outcomes. Basal and ethanol-induced accumbal dopamine release in the rat involve glycine receptors (GlyR) in the nucleus accumbens (nAc). Glycine transporter 1 (GlyT-1) inhibitors, which raise extracellular glycine levels, have repeatedly been shown to decrease ethanol intake in the rat. To further explore the rational for elevating glycine levels in the treatment of AUD, this study examined accumbal extracellular glycine and dopamine levels and voluntary ethanol intake and preference in the rat, after systemic treatment with glycine. The effects of three different doses of glycine i.p. on accumbal glycine and dopamine levels were examined using in vivo microdialysis in Wistar rats. In addition, the effects of the intermediate dose of glycine on voluntary ethanol intake and preference were examined in a limited access two-bottle ethanol/water model in the rat. Systemic glycine treatment increased accumbal glycine levels in a dose-related manner, whereas accumbal dopamine levels were elevated in a subpopulation of animals, defined as dopamine responders. Ethanol intake and preference decreased after systemic glycine treatment. These results give further support to the concept of elevating central glycine levels to reduce ethanol intake and indicate that targeting the glycinergic system may represent a pharmacologic treatment principle for AUD.",

This review evaluated the efficacy and safety of alcohol reduction pharmacotherapy in patients with AD or AUD according to the duration of treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed 15 pharmacological agents. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for eligible trials through to May 2021. Outcomes were heavy drinking days (HDD), total alcohol consumption (TAC), any adverse event and days without drinking.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-five RCTs (n\u2009=\u20098891) were included. Nalmefene was superior to placebo for reducing HDD (standard mean difference [SMD] -0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.37, -0.18) and TAC (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.35, -0.16) in the long-term, but not in the short-term. Topiramate was superior to placebo for reducing HDD (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.59, -0.12) and days without drinking (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.11, 0.82), and baclofen was superior for reducing TAC (SMD -0.70, 95% CI -1.29, -0.11), in the short-term. The frequency of adverse events was higher with nalmefene and topiramate than with placebo.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nNalmefene, topiramate and baclofen may be effective as alcohol reduction pharmacotherapy; however, only nalmefene has demonstrated long-term efficacy, and nalmefene and topiramate have a significantly higher frequency of adverse events compared with placebo.",

    "title": "Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder among adults with medical disorders in Sweden",
    "abstract": "Background Alcohol-attributable medical disorders are prevalent among individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, there is a lack of research on prescriptions of pharmacological treatment for AUD in those with comorbid conditions. This study aims to investigate the utilization of pharmacological treatment (acamprosate, disulfiram and naltrexone) in specialist care among patients with AUD and comorbid medical diagnoses. Methods This was a descriptive register-based Swedish national cohort study including 132,728 adults diagnosed with AUD ( N \u2009=\u2009270,933) between 2007 and 2015. The exposure was alcohol-attributable categories of comorbid medical diagnoses. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated using mixed-effect logistic regression analyses for any filled prescription of acamprosate, disulfiram or oral naltrexone within 12 months post AUD diagnosis. Results Individuals with comorbid alcohol-attributable medical diagnoses had lower odds of filling prescriptions for any type of AUD pharmacotherapy compared to those without such comorbidities. Cardiovascular (OR\u2009=\u20090.41 [95% CI: 0.39\u20130.43]), neurological (OR\u2009=\u20090.52 [95% CI: 0.48\u20130.56]) and gastrointestinal (OR\u2009=\u20090.57 [95% CI: 0.54\u20130.60]) diseases were associated with the lowest rates of prescription receipt. The presence of diagnoses which are contraindications to AUD pharmacotherapy did not fully explain the low prescription rate. Conclusion There is a substantial underutilization of AUD pharmacotherapy in patients with AUD and comorbid medical disorders in specialist care. Increasing the provision of pharmacotherapy to this group of patients is essential and may prevent morbidity and mortality. There is a need to further understand barriers to medical treatment both from the patient and prescriber perspective.",

    "title": "Endpoints for Pharmacotherapy Trials for Alcohol Use Disorder",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a debilitating disorder, yet currently approved pharmacotherapies to treat AUD are under-utilized. The three medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the indication of AUD are disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone. The current landscape of pharmacotherapies for AUD suggests opportunities for improvement. Clinical trials investigating novel pharmacotherapies for AUD traditionally use abstinence-based drinking outcomes or no heavy drinking days as trial endpoints to determine the efficacy of pharmacotherapies. These outcomes are typically measured through patient self-report endorsements of their drinking. Apart from these traditional outcomes, there have been recent developments in novel endpoints for AUD pharmacotherapies. These novel endpoints include utilizing the World Health Organization (WHO) risk drinking level reductions to promote a harm-reduction endpoint rather than an abstinence-based endpoint. Additionally, in contrast to patient self-report measurements, biological markers of alcohol use may serve as objective endpoints in AUD pharmacotherapy trials. Lastly, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) definition of recovery from AUD and patient-oriented outcomes offer new frameworks to consider endpoints associated with more than alcohol consumption itself, such as the provider-patient experiences with novel pharmacotherapies. These recent developments in new endpoints for AUD pharmacotherapies offer promising future opportunities for pharmacotherapy development, so long as validity and reliability measures are demonstrated for the endpoints. A greater breadth of endpoint utilization may better capture the complexity of AUD symptomatology.",

Participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire on sociodemographic and drug use characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with methadone preference (vs. buprenorphine). Among all participants (median age 45, 41% female, 87% ever received OAT), 92% (n\u2009=\u2009366) indicated a preference for receiving OAT (vs. not receiving OAT) and 96% of those (n\u2009=\u2009352) preferred a particular type of OAT. Among 366 with a stated preference, 61% (n\u2009=\u2009216) preferred methadone and 39% (n\u2009=\u2009136) preferred buprenorphine. Among those preferring buprenorphine (n\u2009=\u2009136), 50% (n\u2009=\u200968) preferred buprenorphine \u00b1 naloxone and 50% (n\u2009=\u200968) preferred long-acting injectable buprenorphine. Independent correlates of preferring methadone included past month heroin use (aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.06-3.00) and non-prescribed pharmaceutical opioid use (aOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.07, 4.95), and any prior receipt of methadone treatment (aOR 6.54, 95% CI 2.66, 17.91). Among those receiving OAT, a higher proportion of people currently receiving buprenorphine preferred their medication (61/66, 92%) compared to methadone recipients (180/235, 77%). Nearly all participants preferred OAT, mostly reflecting prior experiences, underscoring the need for expanded access to OAT in Australia. Given the multiple stated preferences, OAT options should include a variety of treatment options aligned with patient preferences, including expanded take-home options.",

    "title": "FDA Approves First Targeted Treatment for Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis: A Perspective on a Landmark in Rare Lipid Storage Disease Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene, leading to deficient sterol 27-hydroxylase activity. This enzyme is critical for bile acid synthesis, and its dysfunction results in reduced chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) levels and subsequent accumulation of cholestanol in tissues. This study highlights the recent FDA approval of Ctexli (chenodiol), a synthetic CDCA formulation, as the first treatment option for CTX. A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar, and relevant articles were identified that focused on the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy, and safety of chenodiol. Data from the RESTORE Phase 3 trial demonstrated that chenodiol significantly reduced plasma cholestanol and urinary bile alcohol levels, with the most pronounced results observed in patients treated before the onset of irreversible neurological damage. The FDA approval of Ctexli validated these findings and established chenodiol as a reliable therapeutic option for CTX. The FDA approval of chenodiol marks a significant milestone in the management of CTX, providing a standardized and evidence-based therapy for a previously neglected condition. Early diagnosis, broader screening, and global access to the drug will be key to improving outcomes and ensuring lasting clinical benefit.",

    "title": "Understanding issues of driving safety and transport utilisation among clients receiving opioid agonist treatment: a cross-sectional survey in New South Wales, Australia.",
    "abstract": "Barriers to accessing opioid agonist treatment (OAT) extend beyond regulatory and clinical constraints, with logistical factors such as clinic location, limited prescriber availability, and transport challenges also playing a role. Despite this, transport-related barriers remain underexplored in the literature. This study aims to examine transport practices and driving histories among OAT clients. A cross-sectional survey across 15 public OAT clinics in New South Wales, Australia, was performed. Data were collected on participant demographics, sedating medication and illicit substance use, driving and other transport practices, and driving offence histories. Multivariate binary logistic regression examined factors associated with driving under the influence and reported driving offences. Of the 482 clients surveyed, 86.5% reported using sedating medications or illicit drugs in the past month, and 40.3% had driven within that period. Fifty-seven participants reported driving after using a potentially impairing substance in the last month, who were more likely to receive OAT from a private clinic or pharmacy (aOR\u00a0=\u00a02.37, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.14-4.92) and report past month illicit drug use (aOR\u00a0=\u00a06.55, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.89-14.83). Participants with recent driving offences were more likely male (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.87, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.11-3.13) and to have a history of a driver licence suspension (aOR\u00a0=\u00a08.95, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a05.38-14.90). Although substance use was common among participants, which could impact on driving safety, most did not report driving under the influence. A subset of clients who drive while impaired may present a public safety risk, and strategies to address this issue would be warranted. Ensuring appropriate access to OAT, including consideration of transport availability, remains a key component of equitable and safe treatment delivery.",

    "title": "Ethanol self-administration reduced the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to decrease cocaine choice in socially housed male and female monkeys.",
    "abstract": "In the clinical population, cocaine is frequently used sequentially or simultaneously with alcohol, and this pattern is linked to poorer treatment outcomes for cocaine use disorder (CUD). Yet, the impact of ethanol on cocaine reinforcement when non-drug alternatives are available remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of ethanol self-administration (1.5g/kg, one hour prior) on cocaine reinforcement under a concurrent cocaine vs. food choice (0.001-0.1mg/kg/injection) procedure in eight socially housed male and female cynomolgus monkeys. Daily sessions consisted of an initial 1hr access to either 1.5g/kg of a sweetened ethanol solution or a sweetened vehicle solution of corresponding volume. These solutions were available in the operant chamber. After the 1-hr fluid access, food (1.0-g food pellet) was available as an alternative to cocaine; only one cocaine dose was available per session. Cocaine choice increased in a dose-dependent manner and ethanol self-administration did not alter the potency of cocaine. To determine whether the reinforcing strength of cocaine was altered by co-use of ethanol, delays were added to the lowest preferred dose of cocaine. When monkeys were exposed to ethanol self-administration, they required longer delays to decrease cocaine choice, suggesting that ethanol increased the reinforcing strength of cocaine. These effects were consistent across sex and social rank. Together, these findings suggest that ethanol may diminish the effectiveness of interventions designed to shift behavior away from cocaine and towards non-drug alternatives. Modeling polysubstance use in preclinical studies will likely improve the likelihood that candidate treatments for CUD will translate successfully to the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) drives alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), and relapsing after abstinence remains a significant challenge before and after transplantation. This review summarizes evidence for pharmacotherapies in relapse prevention and their integration into ALD care. Naltrexone and acamprosate reduce the relapse in the general AUD population, though data in ALD are limited. Baclofen is the only drug tested in randomized trials in cirrhosis, with early benefit but mixed results in later studies. Gabapentin and topiramate are promising off-label options. Emerging agents include glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, psilocybin, and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) analogs, all showing early signals in reducing alcohol use. Despite guideline support, pharmacotherapy is underutilized in ALD due to lack of insight, stigma, provider inexperience, and fragmented care. Integrated programs across the disease spectrum demonstrate feasibility and may improve pharmacotherapy uptake. Pharmacotherapy is effective yet underused for relapse prevention in ALD. Integration with behavioral interventions and multidisciplinary care is essential to expand access, evaluate novel therapies, and improve patient outcomes.",

This pilot RCT explored the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of personalised smartphone-delivered alcohol approach bias modification (ApBM) in Australians (\u226555\u00a0years) drinking at hazardous/harmful levels (AUDIT\u00a0\u2265\u00a08). Double-blinded parallel two-arm pilot RCT in Victoria, Australia (July 2022-January 2023). Community-based\u00a0\u2265\u00a055-year-olds received 'AAT-App+' (n\u00a0=\u00a096) or sham training (n\u00a0=\u00a092) over four-weeks. Feasibility was defined as recruitment of\u00a0\u2265\u00a0100 participants within the recruitment window and 50\u00a0% adherence to four sessions. Acceptability was defined as User Version Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS) mean scores\u00a0\u2265\u00a03. The primary preliminary effectiveness outcome was past-week standard drinks at week four relative to baseline. Feasibility and acceptability were good, with n\u00a0=\u00a0188 recruited, 69\u00a0% training adherence, and 'good' uMARS functionality/aesthetics and 'acceptable' quality ratings among responders (n\u00a0=\u00a094). Retention rates were 56\u00a0% for primary effectiveness outcome. Linear mixed modelling using intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant mean reduction of 6.9 past-week standard drinks relative to baseline overall (p<.001), but no significant group-by-time interaction at the primary endpoint (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-1.90, p=.43, 95\u00a0%CI [-6.62, 2.82]). The groups differed significantly favouring ApBM after two-weeks of training (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-5.28, p=.03, 95\u00a0%CI [-10.01;-0.56]). There were no adverse events throughout the training window. Personalised smartphone ApBM is feasible and acceptable to middle-to-older adults, but we found no evidence to suggest it reduced alcohol consumption any more than sham-training beyond the acute period. Further work is needed prior to large-scale RCT progression to mitigate attrition and optimise study design.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorder (SUD) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, yet many patients face significant barriers to accessing treatment, including experiencing bias and stigma from healthcare providers. To inform improvements in care delivery, this study explored the experiences of healthcare providers who care for pregnant individuals with SUD. Researchers conducted seven focus group discussions (FGD) and fifteen in-depth interviews (IDI) using semi-structured guides, with participants drawn from both rural and urban hospital settings across Utah. All discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and examined using the Template Analysis approach. Among FGD participants (n\u2009=\u200937), the sample was predominantly white (94.6\u2009%), female (86.5\u2009%), rural (89.2\u2009%), and comprised of nurses (78.4\u2009%). The IDI sample (n\u2009=\u200915) was more gender diverse (60\u2009% female), had greater representation of physicians (53.3\u2009%), and a higher proportion of urban participants (60.0\u2009%). Template analysis revealed four major themes. First, providers held a range of perceptions toward pregnant individuals with SUD, reflecting both stigma and empathy. Second, many emphasized the importance of building trust through nonjudgmental communication and emotional support. Third, providers reported high levels of burnout, particularly due to limited resources and systemic barriers. Finally, participants highlighted knowledge gaps related to SUD clinical care and confusion around regulatory requirements like mandatory reporting. Despite the challenges described, many providers expressed strong dedication to delivering compassionate, person-centered care. The findings underscore the need for targeted provider education, institutional policies that reduce care barriers, and increased community and institutional resources to better support patients with SUD during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Many individuals aiming to reduce or quit cannabis use prefer self-guided interventions over formal treatment. In this pilot and feasibility randomized trial, we tested a two-week self-guided online intervention combining multiple evidence-based behavior change approaches. A total of 168 adults who used cannabis weekly, experienced severe cannabis use disorder on average, and reported being motivated to reduce or quit use participated in the baseline assessment and two-week follow-up of this international online intervention study. An additional three-month follow-up was included. Participants were randomized into three conditions: SMART goals alone (minimal intervention control), SMART +\u2009 mental contrasting with implementation intentions (MCII), or SMART +\u2009 MCII +\u2009 Cue-control. Participants set personal reduction or quit goals. We measured subjective goal achievement, objective goal achievement, and cannabis use reduction in grams per week. Both intervention conditions outperformed the (minimal intervention) control condition in achieving subjective and objective reduction goals, with 69\u2009% (MCII) and 60\u2009% (MCII + Cue-control) meeting their objective targets compared to 49\u2009% in the control condition. Adding Cue-control to MCII did not enhance outcomes compared to MCII alone. All conditions, including the control, reported similar reductions in cannabis use (grams per week) and these reductions were largely maintained at three-month follow-up. Two-week retention was high in the active intervention groups, especially in the MCII condition, highlighting the accessibility and appeal of the intervention. This pilot and feasibility randomized trial showed promise of this intervention as an accessible and effective self-guided online cannabis reduction program.",

Brief, accessible, scalable, and low-cost interventions are needed to support people with a CUD. We investigated if a brief mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) reduces cannabis frequency, quantity and craving, compared to both an active and passive control conditions. A pre-registered, double-blind randomised control trial was run in in 66 adults (19 female) aged 18-56 with CUD reporting attempts to cut down or quit in the past 2 years, recruited from the general community (October 2019-July 2022). Participants were 1:1:1 allocated, to one of 3 interventions; MBI (n\u2009=\u200923), Relaxation (n\u2009=\u200921) or Control (n\u2009=\u200922) with a mean duration of 16 days, stratified by age and sex. All conditions included daily monitoring of usage. Baseline and follow-up in person testing occurred in Melbourne, Australia. The intervention occurred online. The primary outcome was change in cannabis use days (\u0394 follow-up minus baseline). Secondary outcomes were changes (\u0394 follow-up minus baseline) in: cannabis grams and craving (visual analogue scale; VAS), mindfulness (Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and relaxation (VAS). We carried out intention-to-treat analysis. There were no significant intervention-by-time effects on the primary outcome - cannabis frequency (F=0.26, FDRp\u2009=\u2009.86)-nor on secondary outcomes: quantity, cravings, relaxation or mindfulness.

    "title": "\"If he did it, I can do it, too. I can change my life around\": The social model of recovery within the context of recovery homes accepting residents prescribed medications for opioid use disorder.",
    "abstract": "This paper provides an in-depth examination of examines four recovery residences, that serve individuals prescribed medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The study has two primary aims: first, to deepen understanding of how recovery residences adopt and operationalize Social Model of Recovery principles; and second, to identify gaps in staff integration of residents receiving MOUD-gaps that may either support or undermine the integrity of the social model within these settings. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 residents receiving MOUD living in four participating recovery homes. The interviews were conducted between August 2022 and January 2024 using a semi-structured interview guide designed to explore residents' experiences upon entering and living in the recovery home. Qualitative software was used to organize and qualitatively analyze transcripts through multiple rounds of coding. Themes were discussed across the research team and grouped across each of the various principles of the Social Model of Recovery. Residents reported feeling supported in safe, structured environments that promoted accountability and community, while staff with lived experience played a central role in fostering trust and modeling long-term recovery. Structured programming, peer coaching, and access to essential resources further reinforced recovery-supportive conditions. However, inconsistent staff attitudes toward MOUD revealed underlying stigma, which some residents found intrusive or isolating. This study addresses key gaps in recovery science by offering qualitative insights into Level 3 recovery residences, emphasizing the perspectives of residents navigating staff relationships, organizational policies, and recovery programming. Despite increasing MOUD acceptance, recovery homes rarely address MOUD-related stigma formally, creating tension between medical and social models of recovery and contributing to judgment or marginalization of MOUD recipients. These findings highlight the urgent need for evidence-based MOUD integration strategies, staff education, and stigma reduction efforts to ensure that recovery homes fully support all residents' recovery pathways.",

    "title": "Multimethod feasibility evaluation of smoking cessation intervention for patients receiving opioid agonist therapy.",
    "abstract": "Among patients receiving opioid agonist therapy, 85% are active tobacco smokers. Despite the significant impact of smoking-related pulmonary diseases on disability and mortality in this population, less than 10% successfully quit smoking with current interventions. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating a smoking cessation intervention at outpatient clinics for persons receiving opioid agonist treatment. The specific outcomes were the feasibility of integration, intervention acceptability, participant retention, and the trial's impact on smoking behaviour. We conducted a 12-week feasibility study among patients receiving OAT (n\u2009=\u200925) in 2021 in Bergen, Norway. The feasibility outcomes were evaluated using qualitative semi-structured interviews and quantitative data collected at study visits during the pilot intervention period. Participants reported that intervention was acceptable as it was easily accessible and provided for free at their local OAT clinic. Participants attended a median of 9 out of 12 weekly study visits and 40% of the participants completed all 12\u00a0weeks. The median number of cigarettes was reduced from 70 (range 31-175) to 26 (range 6-50) during the intervention period for those who attended all 12 study visits. One participant reported quitting smoking. The participants stressed that the possibility to individually choose smoking medication and tapering regimen was important for the acceptability of the intervention. Participant retention and qualitative results support the feasibility of the tested intervention, indicating that implementing integrated smoking cessation treatments in opioid agonist therapy clinics was feasible and acceptable to patients. The low number of participants quitting indicated low feasibility for smoking cessation. Simultaneously, the more than halving of the number of cigarettes smoked suggests that the progression of the intervention should have a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked as the primary aim. However, the impact of this intervention requires thorough evaluation through a sufficiently powered randomised controlled trial.",

    "title": "Development and implementation of recovery housing policies and practices to support people taking medications for opioid use disorder.",
    "abstract": "While recovery housing may be a promising recovery support service to support people prescribed medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), many recovery housing program operators and staff remain hesitant about accepting people taking MOUD into their programs. This is due to MOUD-related stigma, concerns about the risk of MOUD misuse or diversion, and lack of practice-based guidance on how to accommodate people taking MOUD. We conducted 138 interviews with residents and staff from Level II and III MOUD-accepting recovery homes across Texas to understand how recovery housing stakeholders developed and implemented policies to support people prescribed MOUD. We also explored participants perceptions of and experiences with navigating these policies. Stakeholders developed MOUD policies related to three categories (screening and intake; medication oversight; and storage and resident access) along a structured continuum, balancing flexibility with oversight. MOUD policies promoted accountability and feelings of safety among residents. Cultivating a MOUD-supportive culture was central, especially in mixed-residency homes where stigma persisted. Policies evolved through trial and error as residences encountered issues such as stigma, medication diversion, and continuity-of-care gaps. With the exception of added medication policies, stakeholders noted little differences between operating MOUD-accepting and non-MOUD-accepting homes and their residents. Recovery residences can integrate MOUD effectively with tailored policies, staff training, and stigma-reduction strategies. Findings highlight the need for sustained funding, technical support, and research to identify best practices across housing models and ensure equitable access to recovery housing for people prescribed MOUD.",

    "title": "Pregnant Patients Using Opioids: Treatment Access Barriers in the Age of COVID-19",
    "abstract": "Objectives: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many pregnant patients experienced barriers in accessing opioid use disorder (OUD) medication. This project surveyed buprenorphine treatment clinics to determine how many accepted pregnant women before and then during the pandemic. Of those clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic, respondents were asked what services were provided and what forms of payment they accepted. Methods: Between July and September 2020, phone contact was made with every sixth unduplicated clinic in North Carolina listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration treatment locator (N\u200a=\u200a490 clinics). The response rate was 53%. Results: Of the 128 clinics responding, 62 clinics (48%) failed to treat pregnant patients both before and during the pandemic, whereas 66 clinics (52%) accepted pregnant patients before the COVID-19 pandemic, with only 44 (66%) of these clinics accepting pregnant patients during the pandemic. Thus, 33% fewer clinics accepted pregnant women for OUD treatment. Of these 44 clinics, 52% provided same-day intake, 45% prescribed naltrexone, and 57% offered detoxification with opioid agonists. Self-pay (95%), private insurance (77%), and Medicaid (55%) were accepted as payment. Clinics commonly reported providing individual counseling (86%). No clinics provided childcare or transportation. Conclusions: Almost half of the buprenorphine clinics in North Carolina turned away pregnant patients before the pandemic. During the pandemic, only 34% accepted pregnant patients, with 33% clinics that had provided medication treatment before the pandemic declining to treat pregnant patients for OUD. Thus, it is critical that policymakers ensure OUD treatment clinics accept pregnant patients.",

    "title": "\u201cThey make it too hard and too many hoops to jump\u201d: system and organizational barriers to drug treatment during epidemic rates of opioid overdose",
    "abstract": "The United States is currently facing an opioid overdose crisis. Research suggests that multiple interventions are needed to reduce overdose deaths including increasing access and retention to medications to treat opioid use disorders (MOUD, i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) and increasing the distribution and use of naloxone, a medication that can reverse the respiratory depression that occurs during opioid overdoses. However, barriers to MOUD initiation and retention persist and discontinuations of MOUD carry a heightened risk of overdose. Many times, MOUD is not sought as a first line of treatment by people with opioid use disorder (OUD), many of whom seek treatment from medically managed withdrawal (detox) programs. Among those who do initiate MOUD, retention is generally low. The present study examines the treatment experiences of people who use opioids in three states, Connecticut, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. We conducted in-depth interviews with people who use opioids in a rural, urban, and suburban area of three states: Connecticut, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Data analysis was collaborative and key themes were identified through multiple readings, coding of transcripts and discussion with all research team members. Results reveal a number of systemic issues that reduce the likelihood that people initiate and are retained on MOUD including the ubiquity of detox as a first step in drug treatment, abstinence requirements and requiring patients to attend group treatment. MOUD-related stigma was a significant factor in the kinds of treatment participants chose and their experiences in treatment. Interventions to reduce MOUD stigma are needed to encourage MOUD as a first course of treatment. Eliminating abstinence-based rules for MOUD treatment may improve treatment retention and decrease overdose risk.",

    "title": "Barriers to opioid use disorder treatment: A comparison of self-reported information from social media with barriers found in literature",
    "abstract": "Introduction Medications such as buprenorphine and methadone are effective for treating opioid use disorder (OUD), but many patients face barriers related to treatment and access. We analyzed two sources of data\u2014social media and published literature\u2014to categorize and quantify such barriers. Methods In this mixed methods study, we analyzed social media (Reddit) posts from three OUD-related forums (subreddits): r/suboxone, r/Methadone, and r/naltrexone. We applied natural language processing to identify posts relevant to treatment barriers, categorized them into insurance- and non-insurance-related, and manually subcategorized them into fine-grained topics. For comparison, we used substance use-, OUD- and barrier-related keywords to identify relevant articles from PubMed published between 2006 and 2022. We searched publications for language expressing fear of barriers, and hesitation or disinterest in medication treatment because of barriers, paying particular attention to the affected population groups described. Results On social media, the top three insurance-related barriers included having no insurance (22.5%), insurance not covering OUD treatment (24.7%), and general difficulties of using insurance for OUD treatment (38.2%); while the top two non-insurance-related barriers included stigma (47.6%), and financial difficulties (26.2%). For published literature, stigma was the most prominently reported barrier, occurring in 78.9% of the publications reviewed, followed by financial and/or logistical issues to receiving medication treatment (73.7%), gender-specific barriers (36.8%), and fear (31.5%). Conclusion The stigma associated with OUD and/or seeking treatment and insurance/cost are the two most common types of barriers reported in the two sources combined. Harm reduction efforts addressing barriers to recovery may benefit from leveraging multiple data sources.",

    "title": "Costs of implementing a multi-site facilitation intervention to increase access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder",
    "abstract": "The United States has been grappling with the opioid epidemic, which has resulted in over 75,000 opioid-related deaths between April 2020 and 2021. Evidence-based pharmaceutical interventions (buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone) are available to reduce opioid-related overdoses and deaths. However, adoption of these medications for opioid use disorder has been stifled due to individual- and system-level barriers. External facilitation is an evidence-based implementation intervention that has been used to increase access to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), but the implementation costs of external facilitation have not been assessed. We sought to measure the facility-level direct costs of implementing an external facilitation intervention for MOUD to provide decision makers with estimates of the resources needed to implement this evidence-based program. We performed a cost analysis of the pre-implementation and implementation phases, including an itemization of external facilitation team and local site labor costs. We used labor estimates from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, and sensitivity analyses were performed using labor estimates from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Financial Management System general ledger data. The average total costs for implementing an external facilitation intervention for MOUD per site was $18,847 (SD 6717) and ranged between $11,320 and $31,592. This translates to approximately $48 per patient with OUD. Sites with more encounters and participants with higher salaries in attendance had higher costs. This was driven mostly by the labor involved in planning and implementation activities. The average total cost of the pre-implementation and implementation activities were $1031 and $17,816 per site, respectively. In the sensitivity analysis, costs for VHA were higher than BLS estimates likely due to higher wages. Implementing external facilitation to increase MOUD prescribing may be affordable depending on the payer\u2019s budget constraints. Our study reported that there were variations in the time invested at each phase of implementation and the number and type of participants involved with implementing an external facilitation intervention. Participant composition played an important role in total implementation costs, and decision makers will need to identify the most efficient and optimal number of stakeholders to involve in their implementation plans.",

    "abstract": "Objectives A national survey evaluated the availability of naltrexone as a treatment for alcohol use disorder and/or opioid use disorder for pregnant individuals. Provider perceptions of barriers to treatment with naltrexone during pregnancy were also examined. Methods Sites were selected from a national registry of naltrexone prescribers (N = 5208). A 10% sampling of sites within 150 miles of each state\u2019s capital was selected (n = 2073). Survey of 11 questions included availability of naltrexone for pregnant individuals, standard practices for treating pregnant individuals already on naltrexone, and barriers to treatment. Survey responses were summarized to identify top barriers and national trends in service availability. Results Of the 236 sites contacted, 78 (33.1%) completed the survey. There was significant geographic variation in number of available sites, with Northeast United States having the most sites. Of the 78 responding sites, only 23 (35.9%) offered naltrexone for pregnant individuals. The most common barriers to prescribing naltrexone included the following: sites without pregnant patients (15.6%), lack of national guidelines in using naltrexone for pregnant patients (14.1%), providers\u2019 discomfort with prescribing naltrexone during pregnancy due to safety concerns (9.4%), and providers\u2019 discomfort due to inexperience (4.7%) Conclusions Accessibility of naltrexone and related care for pregnant individuals with alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder varies greatly across the United States with numerous barriers and educational gaps identified. Additional research and resources are needed to expand naltrexone treatment access for pregnant individuals.",

    "title": "Probation clients\u2019 barriers to access and use of opioid use disorder medications",
    "abstract": "There is a gap between evidence-based treatment with medications for opioid use disorders (OUDs) and current practices of probation departments who supervise individuals with OUDs. Many probationers with OUDs cannot access FDA-approved medications to treat their disorders despite the strong evidence of their effectiveness. The barriers to medications for those under probation supervision include practitioners\u2019 negative attitudes toward medications, costs, stigma, and diversion risk. Probation officers have an ethical obligation to help their clients reduce barriers to access the care they need which in turn can improve their outcomes and increase public safety. The current study explores how probation departments respond to probationers with OUDs, focusing on the barriers to accessing OUD medications based on a survey of probation department directors/administrators (hereafter referred to as probation department leaders) in Illinois (N\u2009=\u200926). A majority of probation department leaders reported perceived staff barriers to their clients accessing medications. Reasons included lack of medical personnel experience, cost, need for guidance on medications, and regulations set by their organization or jurisdiction that prohibit client use of medications. Probation department leaders reported knowing less about the use of methadone and how it is administered, compared to buprenorphine and naltrexone. In addition, probation department leaders were generally more open to referring clients for treatment that include buprenorphine or naltrexone compared to methadone. Despite slightly less training or familiarity with methadone than the other medications, the number of probation department leaders who knew where to refer someone for each of the three FDA-approved medications was similar. The current study found probation department leaders perceive some barriers to their staff linking or referring their clients to OUD medications. Study findings indicate a need for administration- and staff-level training, interagency collaboration, and policy changes to increase access to, education on, and use of, medications for probation clients. Such efforts will ultimately help probation clients with OUDs stabilize and adhere to other probation requirements and engage in behavioral therapy, which may result in positive outcomes such as reduced recidivism, increased quality of life, and reduced mortality.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe authors examined racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in receiving treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD).\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted that included adults (\u226518 years) with AUD from the All of Us Controlled Tier database v7. Outcomes were lifetime receipt of FDA-approved medications (disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone), psychotherapy (individual, family, and group-based session), and combination treatment (medication and psychotherapy). The study examined treatment receipt by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other), insurance (private, Medicare, Medicare and Medicaid, Medicaid, Veteran Affairs [VA], none), income (<$10K, $10-<$50K, $50-$100K, >$100K), and area deprivation index (ADI) quintiles. Multivariable logistic and multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess the association between patient characteristics and treatment receipt.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe cohort consisted of 18,692 patients (mean age=57.1 years; 60.7% were male; 47.1% were non-Hispanic White). Almost 70% received no treatment, 11.4% received medication, 24.0% received psychotherapy, and 4.9% received combination treatment. In adjusted analysis, non-Hispanic Black (aOR=0.78, 95% CI=0.69-0.89) and Hispanic (aOR=0.75, 95% CI=0.64-0.88) individuals were less likely to receive medication than non-Hispanic White counterparts. There was no association between race/ethnicity and receipt of psychotherapy or combination treatment. Compared with private insurance, dual eligibility was associated with less use of medication, Medicare and Medicaid with less use of medication and combination treatment, and VA and no insurance with more use of psychotherapy and combination treatment. Higher income and lower ADI were positively associated with all treatment types.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere are disparities in AUD treatment by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and insurance. Systematic approaches are required to improve equitable access to effective treatment.",

In the present pilot study, we examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of an m-health intervention combining cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy for individuals with AUD. Methods: Adults with AUD (N\u2009=\u200926) recruited through online, social media-based advertising were enrolled in a 12-week, integrated telemedicine intervention combining psychosocial treatment with medical management: Quit Genius for AUD (QG-A). Feasibility, acceptability, perceived helpfulness, treatment engagement, retention, completion, and clinical outcomes including alcohol use and secondary mental health outcomes were assessed. Results: Participants found the QG-A intervention to be acceptable and helpful in facilitating action toward their therapeutic goals concerning alcohol use. Treatment completion, achieved by the majority (85%) of participants, was excellent. On average, participants reduced their past 30-day alcohol use from baseline (mean proportion of days of abstinent\u2009=\u20090.13) to follow-up (M\u2009=\u20090.59), t(19)\u2009=\u2009\u22124.97, p\u2009<\u20090.001, and consumed fewer drinks per drinking day from baseline (M\u2009=\u20096.7) to follow-up (M\u2009=\u20092.0), t(19)\u2009=\u20093.61, p\u2009<\u20090.001.

    "title": "Estimating the impact of stimulant use on initiation of buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone in two clinical trials and real-world populations",
    "abstract": "Background Co-use of stimulants and opioids is rapidly increasing. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), but stimulant use may decrease the likelihood of initiating MOUD treatment. Furthermore, trial participants may not represent \u201creal-world\u201d populations who would benefit from treatment. Methods We conducted a two-stage analysis. First, associations between stimulant use (time-varying urine drug screens for cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamines) and initiation of buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) were estimated across two RCTs (CTN-0051 X:BOT and CTN-0067 CHOICES) using adjusted Cox regression models. Second, results were generalized to three target populations who would benefit from MOUD: Housed adults identifying the need for OUD treatment, as characterized by the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); adults entering OUD treatment, as characterized by Treatment Episodes Dataset (TEDS); and adults living in rural regions of the U.S. with high rates of injection drug use, as characterized by the Rural Opioids Initiative (ROI). Generalizability analyses adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, substance use, housing status, and depression between RCT and target populations using inverse probability of selection weighting. Results Analyses included 673 clinical trial participants, 139 NSDUH respondents (weighted to represent 661,650 people), 71,751 TEDS treatment episodes, and 1,933 ROI participants. The majority were aged 30\u201349 years, male, and non-Hispanic White. In RCTs, stimulant use reduced the likelihood of MOUD initiation by 32% (adjusted HR [aHR]\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI 0.49\u20130.94, p \u2009=\u20090.019). Stimulant use associations were slightly attenuated and non-significant among housed adults needing treatment (25% reduction, aHR\u2009=\u20090.75, 0.48\u20131.18, p \u2009=\u20090.215) and adults entering OUD treatment (28% reduction, aHR\u2009=\u20090.72, 0.51\u20131.01, p \u2009=\u20090.061). The association was more pronounced, but still non-significant among rural people injecting drugs (39% reduction, aHR\u2009=\u20090.61, 0.35\u20131.06, p \u2009=\u20090.081). Stimulant use had a larger negative impact on XR-NTX initiation compared to buprenorphine, especially in the rural population (76% reduction, aHR\u2009=\u20090.24, 0.08\u20130.69, p \u2009=\u20090.008). Conclusions Stimulant use is a barrier to buprenorphine or XR-NTX initiation in clinical trials and real-world populations that would benefit from OUD treatment. Interventions to address stimulant use among patients with OUD are urgently needed, especially among rural people injecting drugs, who already suffer from limited access to MOUD.",

    "title": "Patient Barriers and Facilitators to Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Primary Care",
    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: This study explored factors influencing patient access to medications for opioid use disorder (OUD), particularly for individuals eligible but historically suboptimal follow-up with in-house referrals to office-based opioid treatment (OBOT). Objectives: In-depth qualitative interviews among a mostly underserved sample of adults with OUD elicited: 1) knowledge and experiences across the OUD treatment cascade; and 2) more nuanced elements of patient-centered care, including shared decision making with providers, experiences in OBOT versus specialty addiction treatment, transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), and voluntary discontinuation of medications for OUD. Methods: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews between January and February of 2018 among adult inpatient detoxification program patients with OUD (n\u2009=\u200923). Preliminary analysis of interviews yielded key themes and ideas that were coded from a grounded theory approach. Results: Willingness to engage with OBOT was influenced by a complex array of practical considerations, including access to patient-centered care in OBOT settings, positive experiences with illicitly obtained buprenorphine, and differential experiences pertaining to OBOT versus specialty addiction treatment. Responses were generally favorable towards OBOT with buprenorphine, yet knowledge regarding extended-release naltrexone was limited. Respondents were often frustrated by clinicians when requesting to transition from methadone to buprenorphine or XR-NTX. Lastly, participants elucidated limited access to OBOT programs in underserved neighborhoods and suburban settings. Conclusion: Limited access to patient-centered care in OBOT with buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone may exacerbate challenges to retention and/or reengagement with OUD care.",

    "title": "Systematic Analysis of the Service Process and the Legislative and Regulatory Environment for a Pharmacist-Provided Naltrexone Injection Service in Wisconsin",
    "abstract": "Community pharmacists are viewed by the public as convenient and trustworthy sources of healthcare and pharmacists likely can play a larger role in addressing the major public health issue of the opioid epidemic affecting Wisconsin residents. Approved medications, including long-acting injectable naltrexone, can transform the treatment of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Due to shortages of behavioral health providers in the U.S., and pharmacists\u2019 knowledge about the safe use of medications, pharmacists can be a significant access point for treating OUD with naltrexone. Wisconsin\u2019s pharmacy practice laws authorize pharmacists to administer medications via injection, and a small number of pharmacists currently are using this authority to provide a naltrexone injection service. This exploratory study had two objectives: (1) describe the pharmacist injection service process and identify barriers and facilitators to that service and (2) analyze the legislative/regulatory environment to ascertain support for expanding naltrexone injection service. Semi-structured pharmacist interviews (n = 4), and an analysis of Wisconsin statutes/regulations governing public health and social services, were undertaken to explore the objectives. Findings suggest that the service process requires considerable coordination and communication with practitioners, patients, and pharmacy staff, but many opportunities exist to broaden and sustain the service throughout Wisconsin.",

    "title": "Medication for opioid use disorder service delivery in carceral facilities: update and summary report",
    "abstract": "The opioid overdose crisis intersects critically with the criminal legal system where individuals with opioid use disorder (are significantly overrepresented. Subsequently, incarceration increases the risk of opioid overdose due to reduced tolerance, interrupted social supports, and limited access to treatment. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), such as methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, have been shown to reduce opioid-related mortality and improve outcomes for those in carceral settings. Despite this, access to MOUD in jails and prisons remains limited due to stigma, concerns about medication diversion, and logistical challenges. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on MOUD in carceral settings, summarizing the prevalence of treatment programs, the role of novel formulations like injectable buprenorphine, and barriers to implementation. It also explores the continuum of care, emphasizing the importance of initiating MOUD during incarceration and ensuring continuation upon release to prevent treatment gaps. Recent policy changes, such as Sect. 1115 Medicaid waivers, offer promising avenues for expanding access, but retention in treatment and post-release outcomes remain significant challenges. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of existing literature and updates on MOUD service delivery, including the impact of recent policy shifts and research on outcomes such as recidivism and health improvement. It concludes by identifying key areas for future research, including strategies to improve treatment retention, address systemic barriers through criminal justice reform, and enhance care coordination during the transition from incarceration to the community.",

    "title": "Novel Agents for the Pharmacological Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent but severely under-treated disorder, with only three widely-approved pharmacotherapies. Given that AUD is a very heterogeneous disorder, it is unlikely that one single medication will be effective for all individuals with an AUD. As such, there is a need to develop new, more effective, and diverse pharmacological treatment options for AUD with the hopes of increasing utilization and improving care. In this qualitative literature review, we discuss the efficacy, mechanism of action, and tolerability of approved, repurposed, and novel pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AUD with a clinical perspective. Pharmacotherapies discussed include: disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, nalmefene, topiramate, gabapentin, varenicline, baclofen, sodium oxybate, aripiprazole, ondansetron, mifepristone, ibudilast, suvorexant, prazosin, doxazosin, N-acetylcysteine, GET73, ASP8062, ABT-436, PF-5190457, and cannabidiol. Overall, many repurposed and novel agents discussed in this review demonstrate clinical effectiveness and promise for the future of AUD treatment. Importantly, these medications also offer potential improvements towards the advancement of precision medicine and personalized treatment for the heterogeneous AUD population. However, there remains a great need to improve access to treatment, increase the menu of approved pharmacological treatments, and de-stigmatize and increase treatment-seeking for AUD.",

    "title": "Perceptions of buprenorphine barriers and efficacy among nurse practitioners and physician assistants",
    "abstract": "Background Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs), including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, decrease mortality and morbidity for people with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine and methadone have the strongest evidence base among MOUDs. Unlike methadone, buprenorphine may be prescribed in office-based settings in the U.S., including by nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) who have a federal waiver and adhere to federal patient limits. Buprenorphine is underutilized nationally, particularly in rural areas, and NPs/PAs could help address this gap. Therefore, we sought to identify perceptions of buprenorphine efficacy and perceptions of prescribing barriers among NPs/PAs. We also sought to compare perceived buprenorphine efficacy and perceived prescribing barriers between waivered and non-waivered NPs/PAs, as well as to compare perceived buprenorphine efficacy to perceived naltrexone and methadone efficacy. Methods We disseminated an online survey to a random national sample of NPs/PAs. We used Mann\u2013Whitney U tests to compare between waivered and non-waivered respondents. We used non-parametric Friedman tests and post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare perceptions of medication types. Results 240 respondents participated (6.5% response rate). Most respondents agreed buprenorphine is efficacious and believed counseling and peer support should complement buprenorphine. Buprenorphine was generally perceived as more efficacious than both naltrexone and methadone. Perceived buprenorphine efficacy and prescribing barriers differed by waiver status. Non-waivered practitioners were more likely than waivered practitioners to have concerns about buprenorphine affecting patient mix. Among waivered NPs/PAs, key buprenorphine prescribing barriers were insurance prior authorization and detoxification access. Conclusions Our results suggest that different policies should target perceived barriers affecting waivered versus non-waivered NPs/PAs. Concerns about patient mix suggest stigmatization of patients with OUD. NP/PA education is needed about comparative medication efficaciousness, particularly regarding methadone. Even though many buprenorphine treatment patients benefits from counseling and/or peer support groups, NPs/PAs should be informed that such psychosocial treatment methods are not necessary for all buprenorphine patients.",

    "abstract": "Front-line treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include psychotherapy and medication, and both treatments are underused. However, utilization rates of medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) are particularly low. The goal of the present scoping review is to characterize patient perspectives about MAUD to identify barriers to MAUD and potential areas of future work to increase access, initiation, and retention on MAUD. Searches of titles and abstracts were conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL until March 2024 with patient perspective-, MAUD-, and alcohol-related keywords. Articles were assessed for eligibility and included in the present review if they examined adult patients' perspectives of MAUD. Fourteen studies were included in the review. The majority of patient populations assessed were individuals with AUD, and most studies evaluated MAUD in general (n\u2009=\u20097) or specific medications (i.e., naltrexone, n\u2009=\u20095; disulfiram, n\u2009=\u20092; acamprosate, n\u2009=\u20091). Important themes related to patient-perceived barriers to MAUD were identified, including a lack of awareness and misunderstanding about the effectiveness and effects of MAUD, apprehensiveness or experience with side effects, and perceived stigma of MAUD. Future work incorporating patient perspectives of MAUD into interventions and strategies may help improve MAUD uptake, including person-centered discussions factoring in unique patient perspectives about MAUD to increase patient MAUD knowledge and reduce MAUD stigma.",

There are numerous evidence-based treatments and strategies to treat AUD, but they are under-utilized for a variety of reasons, including provider stigma, lack of knowledge, lack of professional support, shortage of willing providers, and patient barriers. Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are approved but underused medications for the treatment of AUD. Nonpharmacological strategies and treatments include the use of motivational interviewing when talking to patients about their alcohol use, peer support or mutual help groups, and individualized therapy. Nurses are in a prime position to educate themselves and patients on evidence-based treatments for AUD and to help patients access those treatments. [",

    "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy for Alcohol Dependence (AD) is underutilized. Barriers preventing the use of AD medications include high prices, lack of access to prescribing physicians, and a limited number of available medications. The study evaluated the use of AD medications in a sample of Italian outpatients who received these medications free of charge, had access to physicians during office hours, and for whom substitution therapy [gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)] was available. We also evaluated the rate of patients who received a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments among participants who were still drinking. SCID for AD and questionnaire were filled by to AD outpatients during a face-to-face interview. 345 AD outpatients were interviewed: 58.8% were currently receiving at least one AD medication (GHB: 34.3%, disulfiram: 29.6%, acamprosate: 5.9%; naltrexone: 2.5%; more than one medication: 16.7%). Less than 30% of participants who were still drinking, received a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. Nonetheless, we found higher use of AD medications compared to previous studies conducted in other countries. This higher use of AD medications may be due to access to free medications, prescribing physicians' style, and a larger number of available medications. Our results confirm the underutilization of AD medications, as less than 60% of AD outpatients received medications, and less than 30% of those who were still drinking, received a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. These findings may be useful in improving our knowledge of the barriers that prevent the use of AD medications in clinical practice.",

    "title": "The Place of Pharmacotherapy in Alcohol Use Disorder Management in Family Practice - A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most prevalent mental disorders around the world, yet still remain the most undertreated. Many studies report the low rate of treatment uptake, less than 20%, among people with AUD. Among those accessing care, a large majority only approach their GP for help. Therefore, primary care is a strategic setting for the identification and the management of AUD. International recommendations stress AUD pharmacotherapy for withdrawal and craving management, but very few studies have shown interest in the management of AUDs in primary care. The main objective of this study was to analyse pharmacotherapy in AUD management in primary care by means of a systematic literature review. A systematic literature review (PRISMA) was carried out. 5 databases were screened: PUBMED via MEDLINE, LiSSa, the SUDOC catalogue, PASCAL and EMBASE. Search algorithms were used integrating the concepts of pharmacotherapy management, alcohol use disorders and primary care, only in the English language. 296 studies were selected and 10 were included. One was a follow-up study on the national prescription database, while four were cross-sectional studies with an auto-questionnaire survey. Of the 10 studies included, two were conducted in Europe, five in North America, two in Australia and one in South Africa. These pharmacotherapy studies were concerned with the anti-craving treatment, and 3 types of medications were used: Disulfiram, Acamprosate and Naltrexone. Factors identified as limiting or facilitating prescriptions concerned cost, indications, efficacy, training and adjuncts to pharmacotherapy. Knowledge and prescription of pharmacotherapy for AUD, more specifically, anti-craving treatment, is insufficient in primary care. There is a lack of data and studies on the efficacy of anti-craving treatment in primary care. Guidelines for AUD management, including psychological and medical management and pharmacotherapy, do exist but have not been adapted to primary care practice. Barriers and facilitators of pharmacotherapy prescription in AUD in primary care were identified in this study.",

    "title": "A rapid access to addiction medicine clinic facilitates treatment of substance use disorder and reduces substance use.",
    "abstract": "Substance use is prevalent in Canada, yet treatment is inaccessible. The Rapid Access to Addiction Medicine (RAAM) clinic opened at the University Health Network (UHN) in January 2018 as part of a larger network of addictions clinics in Toronto, Ontario, to enable timely, low barrier access to medical treatment for substance use disorder (SUD). Patients attend on a walk-in basis without requiring an appointment or referral. We describe the RAAM clinic model, including referral patterns, patient demographics and substance use patterns. Secondary outcomes include retention in treatment and changes in both self-reported and objective substance use. The Electronic Medical Record at the clinic was reviewed for the first 26\u2009weeks of the clinic's operation. We identified SUD diagnoses, referral source, medications prescribed, retention in care and self-reported substance use. The clinic saw 64 unique patients: 66% had alcohol use disorder (AUD), 39% had opiate use disorder (OUD) and 20% had stimulant use disorder. Fifty-five percent of patients were referred from primary care providers, 30% from the emergency department and 11% from withdrawal management services. Forty-two percent remained on-going patients, 23% were discharged to other care and 34% were lost to follow-up. Gabapentin (39%), naltrexone (39%), and acamprosate (15%) were most frequently prescribed for AUD. Patients with AUD reported a significant decrease in alcohol consumption at their most recent visit. Most patients (65%) with OUD were prescribed buprenorphine, and most patients with OUD (65%) had a negative urine screen at their most recent visit. The RAAM model provides low-barrier, accessible outpatient care for patients with substance use disorder and facilitates the prescription of evidence-based pharmacotherapy for AUD and OUD. Patients referred by their primary care physician and the emergency department demonstrated a reduction in median alcohol consumption and high rates of opioid abstinence.",

    "title": "Receipt of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder by justice-involved women in the Veterans Health Administration.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and unhealthy drinking are prevalent among women involved in the criminal justice system and women military veterans. Pharmacotherapy-including naltrexone, topiramate, acamprosate, and disulfiram-for AUD is one form of effective treatment that is associated with better health and criminal justice outcomes. The current study examined the association of justice involvement with receipt of pharmacotherapy for AUD, as well as other patient factors that may explain variation in receipt of pharmacotherapy for AUD among women veterans who receive care at Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities. Using national VHA clinical records, we examined all women VHA patients who received an AUD diagnosis during an outpatient or inpatient visit in fiscal years (FY) 2014-2017. We compared patient characteristics by justice status, defined as contact with one of the VHA's justice outreach programs, and used a mixed-effects logistic regression model to test whether justice involvement was independently associated with odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD. Of 10,511 women veterans diagnosed with AUD in FY2017, 852 (8%) met our definition of justice-involved. Since FY2014, the percentage of women veterans who received pharmacotherapy for AUD increased (14-21%). Women justice-involved veterans and those who were homeless had higher odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD (OR 1.29, CI 1.15-1.45; OR 1.35, CI 1.25-1.47). Women veterans age 55 or older or who were African-American had lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy (OR 0.74, CI 0.67-0.82; OR 0.73, CI 0.68-0.79). While women involved in the criminal justice system face many barriers to accessing health and social services, women justice-involved veterans had higher odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD at VHA facilities compared to women veterans with no justice involvement. Legal mandates and supportive programming directed towards veterans in the criminal justice system may explain the higher rate of receipt of pharmacotherapy observed among justice-involved women veterans. Women veterans who are homeless may also have more opportunities to access and use pharmacotherapy for AUD compared to their housed counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Among US military veterans, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is prevalent and in severe cases patients need intensive AUD treatment beyond outpatient care. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) delivers intensive, highly structured addiction and psychosocial treatment through residential programs. Despite the evidence supporting pharmacotherapy among the effective treatments for AUD, receipt of these medications (e.g., naltrexone, acamprosate) among patients in residential treatment programs varies widely. In order to better understand this variation, the current study examined barriers and facilitators to use of pharmacotherapy for AUD among patients in VA residential treatment programs. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with residential program management and staff were conducted and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used to guide coding and analysis of interview transcripts. Barriers to use of pharmacotherapy for AUD included cultural norms or philosophy against prescribing, lack of access to willing prescribers, lack of interest from leadership, and perceived lack of patient interest or need. Facilitators included cultural norms of openness or active promotion of pharmacotherapy; education for patients, program staff and prescribers; having prescribers on staff, and care coordination within residential treatment and with other clinic settings in and outside VA. Developing and testing improvement strategies to increase care coordination and consistent support from leadership may also yield increases in the use of pharmacotherapy for AUD among residential patients.",

The meta-analysis disclosed that both total and ionized circulating magnesium are markedly reduced in chronic alcohol-use disorder. The funnel plot and the Egger\u2019s test did not disclose significant publication bias. The I2-test demonstrated significant statistical heterogeneity between studies. We also found that the skeletal muscle magnesium content is reduced and the kidney\u2019s normal response to hypomagnesemia is blunted. In conclusion, magnesium depletion is common in chronic alcohol-use disorder. Furthermore, the kidney plays a crucial role in the development of magnesium depletion.",

    "abstract": "Background and Aims: The role of medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) in patients with cirrhosis is not well established. Evidence on the efficacy and safety of these drugs in these patients is scarce. Approach and Results: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol guidelines on the efficacy of MAUD in patients with cirrhosis. A search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, including all studies until May 2022. The population was defined as patients with AUD and cirrhosis. The primary outcome was alcohol abstinence. Safety was a secondary outcome. We performed a random-effect analysis and expressed the results as relative risk of alcohol consumption. Heterogeneity was measured by I 2. Out of 4095 unique references, 8 studies on 4 different AUD treatments [baclofen (n = 6), metadoxine (n = 1), acamprosate (n = 1), and fecal microbiota transplant (n = 1)] in a total of 794 patients were included. Four were cohort studies, and 4 were RCTs. Only RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. MAUD was associated with a reduced rate of alcohol consumption [relative risk = 0.68 (CI: 0.48\u20130.97), P = 0.03], increasing alcohol abstinence by 32% compared to placebo or standard treatment, despite high heterogeneity (I 2 = 67%). Regarding safety, out of 165 serious adverse events in patients treated with MAUD, only 5 (3%) were possibly or probably related to study medications. Conclusion: MAUD in patients with cirrhosis is effective in promoting alcohol abstinence and has a good safety profile. Larger studies on the effects of MAUD are needed, especially in patients with advanced liver disease.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to anticipate and detect rewarding outcomes is fundamental for the development of adaptive decision\u2010making and goal\u2010oriented behavior. Delineating the neural correlates of different stages of reward processing is imperative for understanding the neurobiological mechanism underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD). To examine the neural correlates of monetary anticipation and outcome in AUD patients, we performed two separate voxel\u2010wise meta\u2010analyses of functional neuroimaging studies, including 12 studies investigating reward anticipation and 7 studies investigating reward outcome using the monetary incentive delay task. During the anticipation stage, AUD patients displayed decreased activation in response to monetary cues in mesocortical\u2010limbic circuits and sensory areas, including the ventral striatum (VS), insula, hippocampus, inferior occipital gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, lingual gyrus and fusiform gyrus. During the outcome stage, AUD patients exhibited reduced activation in the dorsal striatum, VS and insula, and increased activation in the orbital frontal cortex and medial temporal area. Our findings suggest that different activation patterns are associated with nondrug rewards during different reward processing stages, potentially reflecting a changed sensitivity to monetary reward in AUD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND AIMS\nThere is emerging evidence that heavy long-term alcohol consumption may alter the neuroimmune profile. We conducted a meta-analysis of the association between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and the extent of neuroinflammation using cerebrospinal (CSF), PET (Positron Emission Tomography), and postmortem studies.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nA comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\u00a0Protocols\u00a0(PRISMA-P) for AUD-related terms in combination with neuroinflammatory markers and cytokine- and chemokine-related terms for CSF, PET, and postmortem studies. Participants had to meet established criteria for AUD and/or heavy alcohol consumption with dependence features and be compared with healthy controls. Papers retrieved were assessed for inclusion criteria and a critical appraisal was completed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A meta-analysis was conducted on postmortem and PET studies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEleven papers met the inclusion criteria with CSF, PET, and postmortem studies included in the final analysis. Postmortem studies demonstrate significant heterogeneity (\ud835\udc44 (14)\u00a0=\u00a062.02, \ud835\udc5d\u2009<\u20090.001), with the alcohol group showing higher levels of neuroimmune markers than controls (\ud835\udc51\u00a0=\u00a01.50 [95% CI 0.56, 2.45]). PET studies demonstrated a lower [11 C] PBR28 total volume of distribution (V T ) for translocator protein in the hippocampus (g\u00a0=\u00a0-1.95 [95% CI -2.72, -1.18], p\u2009<\u20090.001) of the alcohol group compared to controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere is emerging evidence across multiple diagnostic modalities that alcohol impacts neuroimmune signaling in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Background: Topiramate (TPM) has the potential to become one of the most prominent treatment options for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We investigated the efficacy of TPM for AUD treatment, considering new randomized controlled trials carried out since the publication of four prior investigations. Methods: We searched six major databases, comparing TPM to placebo for AUD treatment. We performed a Bayesian meta-analysis. We conducted a meta-regression, analyzing the effect of age, TPM dosage, duration of treatment, gender, and attrition rate on the outcomes measured. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42021286266. Results: TPM reduced heavy drinking days (d\u2009=\u20090.401, Bayes factor (BF)\u2009=\u200923.088) and weeks (d\u2009=\u20090.461, BF\u2009=\u20093.784), lowered alcohol craving (d\u2009=\u20090.477, BF\u2009=\u2009107.749), prolonged abstinence throughout the duration of trials (d\u2009=\u20090.505, BF\u2009=\u200954.998), and decreased the amount of gamma-glutamyl transferase in the blood (d\u2009=\u20090.345, BF\u2009=\u200939.048). The analysis pointed out that TPM could reduce anxiety (d\u2009=\u20090.517, BF\u2009=\u20095.993). TPM\u2019s efficacy in relieving alcohol withdrawal, minimizing relapse, and decreasing depressive symptoms was inconclusive.

    "title": "Magnitude and determinants of alcohol use disorder among adult population in East Asian countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Introduction Alcohol use disorder is a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to control or stop alcohol use despite adverse health outcomes. Despite several studies that have analyzed the prevalence and determinants, their results have been equivocal, and the reasons for the differences in prevalence rates and determinants of AUD across nationalities are unknown. Hence, this study estimated the pooled prevalence of alcohol use disorder and its determinant among adults in East Asian countries. Methods Articles were searched from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Scopus. All observational study designs that fulfilled the predefined criteria were included in the study. The findings were reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The quality and heterogeneity of articles were assessed using the new castle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and I2, respectively. Additionally, publication bias was checked through funnel plot and Egger's regression test. Results A total of 14 articles with 93, 161 study participants were considered in the study. Of which 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis of the 1-year prevalence of alcohol use disorder, 6 in the lifetime, 9 in alcohol abuse, and 8 in alcohol dependency. Consequently, the overall pooled prevalence of one-year alcohol use disorder was 8.88% (95% CI: 6.32, 11.44), lifetime 13.41% (95%CI: 8.48, 18.34), alcohol abuse 5.4% (95% CI: 2.66, 8.13), and alcohol dependency 4.47% (95% CI: 2.66, 6.27). In the subgroup analysis by country, the highest 1-year and lifetime pooled prevalence of alcohol use disorder was observed in Korea at 9.78% (95% CI:4.40, 15.15) and 16.73% (95% CI: 15.31, 18.16), respectively. Besides, smoking (OR: 3.99; 95% CI: 1.65, 6.33) and male gender (OR: 5.9; 95% CI: 3.3, 8.51) were significant determinants of alcohol use disorder. Conclusions The magnitude of alcohol use disorder was high among adults in East Asian countries. Smoking and male gender were the key determinants of alcohol use disorders.",

    "title": "The impact of psychedelics on patients with alcohol use disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives Critique the available systematic review and de novo assessment of the role of psychedelics in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Methods A systematic literature search of PubMed was completed from 1960 to 9/9/2023. We pooled randomized controlled trials comparing psychedelics to control therapy for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Results At the first recorded follow-up, LSD [n\u2009=\u20093, Odds Ratio (OR) 1.99 (95% Confidence interval (CI): 1.10 to 3.61)] and any psychedelic [n\u2009=\u20094, OR 2.16 (95%CI: 1.26 to 3.69)] enhanced the odds of patients achieving abstinence or a substantial reduction in drinking alcohol versus placebo in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. When the inclusion criteria were relaxed to include controlled trials without double-blinding or placebo control, LSD [n\u2009=\u20095, OR 1.79 (95%CI: 1.36 to 2.34)] and any psychedelic therapy [n\u2009=\u20096, OR 1.89 (95%CI: 1.42 to 2.50)] still enhanced the odds of patients achieving abstinence or a substantial reduction in drinking alcohol. Four of 6 trials had high risk of bias and other methodological issues. One trial found an instance of suicidal ideation as well as transient increases in blood pressure that requires further exploration before the balance of benefits to harms can be determined. Conclusions The use of psychedelics to treat alcohol use disorder is promising, but the weaknesses in the literature base preclude making definitive statements about its value. Future trials with greater methodological rigor are needed. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Lysergic acid diethylamine (LSD) and psilocybin (hallucinogenic mushrooms) are psychedelics that have been studied in patients with alcohol use disorder (chronic issue with heavy or problem drinking). When all the studies are pooled together in a meta-analysis, the odds of being able to refrain from drinking alcohol or to substantially reduce the amount of alcohol consumed was enhanced by 89%. This is a promising finding that if bore out in additional studies, especially those with higher study quality, would be a major advance in patients with alcohol use disorder. We cannot make more definitive conclusions because all the LSD studies were published between 1966 and 1970 which may not reflect contemporary practice and most of the studies had methodological weaknesses that reduce confidence in the studies to prove the benefits. It is heartening that the single psilocybin trial from 2022 was of higher methodological quality, reflected contemporary practice, and still showed positive effects.",

    "title": "The Combined Effects of Alcohol Consumption and Smoking on Cancer Risk by Exposure Level: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Alcohol consumption is a major risk factor for cancer, and when combined with smoking, the risk increases. Nevertheless, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the combined effects of alcohol consumption and smoking on the risk of various cancer types. Therefore, to assess these effects, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We performed a systematic search of five literature databases, focusing on cohort and case-control studies. Considering exposure levels, we quantified the combined effects of alcohol consumption and smoking on cancer risk and assessed multiplicative interaction effects. Results Of 4,452 studies identified, 24 (4 cohort studies and 20 case-control studies) were included in the meta-analysis. We detected interaction effect of light alcohol and moderate smoking on head and neck cancer risk (relative risk [RR], 4.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.50\u20137.26; I2 = 65%). A synergistic interaction was observed in heavy alcohol and heavy smoking group (RR, 35.24; 95% CI, 23.17\u201353.58; I2 = 69%). In more detailed cancer types, the interaction effect of heavy alcohol and heavy smoking was noticeable on oral (RR, 36.42; 95% CI, 24.62\u201353.87; I2 = 46%) and laryngeal (RR, 38.75; 95% CI, 19.25\u201378.01; I2 = 69%) cancer risk. Conclusion Our study provided a comprehensive summary of the combined effects of alcohol consumption and smoking on cancers. As their consumption increased, the synergy effect became more pronounced, and the synergy effect was evident especially for head and neck cancer. These findings provide additional evidence for the combined effect of alcohol and smoking in alcohol guidelines for cancer prevention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims The association between alcohol consumption and risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD) is inconclusive. We conducted this study to examine the association between alcohol consumption and PAD risk in two de novo cohort studies and a meta-analysis of observational studies. Methods and results A systematic review was conducted to identify studies on alcohol consumption in relation to PAD risk. We further used data from two cohorts of 70 116 Swedish and 405 406 British adults and performed a meta-analysis of results from previously published studies and current cohort studies. There was a U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and incident PAD risk in the Swedish and British cohorts. The meta-analysis of results of these two cohorts and previously published studies found that compared with non- or never-drinkers, the relative risk of PAD was 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77\u20130.89], 0.81 (95% CI 0.74\u20130.90), and 0.94 (95% CI 0.83\u20131.07) for light, moderate, and high-to-heavy alcohol drinkers, respectively. The nonlinear meta-analysis revealed a possibly U-shaped association between alcohol consumption and PAD risk (P nonlinearity <0.001). The risk of PAD was observed to be the lowest for 2 drinks/week and to be pronounced for \u226510 drinks/week. All these associations persisted in a sensitivity meta-analysis including cohort and other types of observational studies. Conclusion Alcohol intake \u22642 drinks/week was associated with a reduced risk of PAD, and the risk of PAD became pronounced with intake \u226510 drinkers/week.",

Studies were gathered via PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, APA PsycInfo, and Global Health. All identified study records underwent a two-step screening process and risk of bias assessment.\n\n\nRESULTS\nData were extracted from 94 studies that met inclusion criteria; 16 studies (17%) examined associations with heavy alcohol use and 91 studies (97%) tested effects of PBS on alcohol consequences. All studies that measured a total effect of PBS use (summations across all strategies) found significant negative associations with heavy alcohol use and 91% were negatively associated with alcohol consequences. Most studies that examined subscales of PBS found at least one significant, negative relation with heavy alcohol use (73%) and alcohol-related consequences (78%), though effects varied across type of subscale (e.g., manner of drinking).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur results support the use of PBS to address heavy alcohol consumption and related harms among young adults. Opportunities for refinement of current PBS in preventive interventions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).",

However, to the best of our knowledge, no dose\u2010response meta\u2010analysis has been performed to date. This study aims to investigate the association between alcohol consumption and psoriasis. The search was performed on July 27, 2021, using Embase and MEDLINE. The restricted cubic spline analysis was used to perform a dose\u2010response analysis. We identified 3,904 studies, of which 48 studies with 1,702,847 individuals across 24 countries were included. Alcohol consumption was positively associated with psoriasis (odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27\u20101.70). In addition, a significantly increased OR for psoriasis was observed in males (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.13\u20133.01) but not in females (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.97\u20131.54). Based on eight studies, including three cohort and five case\u2010control studies, the analysis revealed that with each additional gram of daily alcohol intake, the OR for psoriasis increased by 4%.

    "title": "Barriers and enablers to addressing smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity and gestational weight gain (SNAP-W) as part of antenatal care: A mixed methods systematic review",
    "abstract": "International clinical guidelines recommend that smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption, physical activity and gestational weight gain (SNAP-W) be addressed as part of routine antenatal care throughout pregnancy. However, guideline recommendations are poorly implemented, and few antenatal care recipients routinely receive the recommended care. There is a need to establish the determinants (barriers and enablers) to care delivery to inform strategies to improve implementation. This systematic review aimed to synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence of the barriers and enablers to the routine delivery of antenatal care targeting SNAP-W health risks. A systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Seven databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 2001 and November 2023. Study findings were coded and analysed according to the domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Forty-nine studies were included in the review, 27 qualitative studies and 22 quantitative studies. The studies were conducted in 14 countries. Data were collected from 7146 antenatal care providers (midwives, Aboriginal health workers, obstetricians, medical officers, general practitioners) and 352 barriers and enablers were identified. Across all SNAP-W health risk and antenatal care provider groups, the predominant TDF domain was \u2018environmental context and resources\u2019, identified in 96% of studies. Barriers within this domain included insufficient time, limited access to and quality of resources, and limited organisational supports. \u2018Beliefs about consequences\u2019 was the second most common TDF domain, reported in 67% of studies, particularly studies of care related to alcohol use, nutrition/ physical activity/ gestational weight gain and those involving midwives, multidisciplinary practitioners and general practitioners. \u2018Optimism\u2019 was the second most common TDF domain for studies of smoking-related care and involving obstetricians, gynaecologists, and other mixed medical professions. It is critical that determinants related to environmental context and resources including time, resources and organisational supports are considered in the development of strategies to support the implementation of recommended antenatal care related to SNAP-W risks. Strategies addressing clinician beliefs about consequences and optimism may also be needed to support the implementation of care related to specific health behaviours and by specific antenatal care provider groups.

    "title": "Association of the Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and Testosterone Hormones in Men: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background: The present study is a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to investigate the effects of alcohol consumption on male sex hormones in humans. Methods: We conducted searches on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar from June 2020 to June 2022. We included observational studies (cohorts, case-controls, and cross-sectional studies) comparing FSH, LH, or testosterone levels in alcohol consumers versus non-consumers. Subgroup analysis based on alcohol intake levels was conducted to explore potential heterogeneity sources. The meta-analysis was done by STATA version 11. Seventeen studies met the criteria. Results: Combining data from these studies, the standardized mean differences for FSH, LH, and testosterone in alcohol-exposed versus non-exposed groups were \u22120.00 (95% CI: \u22120.099\u20130.099), 0.04 (95% CI: 0.00\u20130.12), and 0.03 (95% CI: \u22120.11\u20130.16), respectively, showing no statistical significance. Subgroup analysis indicated a significant difference in FSH levels between moderate/high and low alcohol consumption groups (\u22120.04, 95% CI: \u22120.08 to \u22120.00). Similarly, compared to non-exposed individuals, testosterone levels differed significantly in groups with moderate (0.22, 95% CI: 0.12\u20130.32) and low (0.19, 95% CI: 0.04\u20130.35) alcohol intake. Given the notable alterations observed in testosterone levels among individuals with alcohol use disorder and the associated feedback changes in LH levels, it has been concluded that alcohol overuse should be recognized as a factor with destructive effects. Conclusions: It is suggested that future research includes comprehensive studies to investigate the changes in the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis induced by alcohol consumption.",

The effect of tobacco smoking on sperm were more significant in smokers than in non-smokers. Alcohol consumption affects the quality and quantity of semen. Both tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption combined may amplify their negative effects toward semen parameters.\n Conclusion: Smoking and alcohol has a detrimental impact on conventional semen characteristics. Due to the harmful effects of both factors, men seeking reproduction should be advised to avoid these habits.",

    "title": "Cancer risk based on alcohol consumption levels: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Alcohol consumption is a well-established risk factor for cancer. Despite extensive research into the relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer risk, the effect of light alcohol consumption on cancer risk remains a topic of debate. To contribute to this discourse, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS Our systematic review aimed to investigate the associations between different levels of alcohol consumption and the risk of several cancer types. We focused on analyzing prospective associations using data from 139 cohort studies. Among them, 106 studies were included in the meta-analysis after a quantitative synthesis. RESULTS Our analysis did not find a significant association between light alcohol consumption and all-cause cancer risk (relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.04), but we observed a dose-response relationship. Light alcohol consumption was significantly associated with higher risks of esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancers. Light to moderate drinking was associated with elevated risks of esophageal, colorectal, laryngeal, and breast cancers. Heavy drinking was also found to contribute to the risk of stomach, liver, pancreas, and prostate cancers, thereby increasing the risk of almost all types of cancer. Additionally, females generally had lower cancer risks compared to males. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight that cancer risks extend beyond heavy alcohol consumption to include light alcohol consumption as well. These findings suggest that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption associated with cancer risk. Our results underscore the importance of public health interventions addressing alcohol consumption to mitigate cancer risks.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nModerate alcohol use may be associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previous reviews have reached mixed conclusions.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nTo quantify the dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and T2DM, accounting for differential effects by sex and BMI.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nMedline, Embase, Web of Science, and one secondary data source.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nCohort studies on the relationship between alcohol use and T2DM.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nFifty-five studies, and one secondary data source, were included with a combined sample size of 1,363,355 men and 1,290,628 women, with 89,983 and 57,974 individuals, respectively, diagnosed with T2DM.\n\n\nDATA SYNTHESIS\nMultivariate dose-response meta-analytic random-effect models were used. For women, a J-shaped relationship was found with a maximum risk reduction of 31% (relative risk [RR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74) at an intake of 16 g of pure alcohol per day compared with lifetime abstainers. The protective association ceased above 49 g per day (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-0.99). For men, no statistically significant relationship was identified. When results were stratified by BMI, the protective association was only found in overweight and obese women.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS\nOur analysis relied on aggregate data. We included some articles that determined exposure and cases via self-report, and the studies did not account for temporal variations in alcohol use.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe observed reduced risk seems to be specific to women in general and women with a BMI \u226525 kg/m2. Our findings allow for a more precise prediction of the sex-specific relationship between T2DM and alcohol use, as our results differ from those of previous studies.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic changed various lifestyle habits worldwide due to the prevention measures implemented in each country, these changes may affect or benefit people\u2019s health. We aimed to systematically review changes in diet, physical activity (PA), alcohol consumption, and tobacco use habits during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults. Two databases: PubMed and ScienceDirect, were used for this systematic review. The research was limited to open-access, peer-reviewed original articles published in English, French, or Spanish from January 2020 to December 2022 and investigated diet, PA, alcohol consumption, and tobacco use habits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults. Excluded studies were review studies, intervention studies with a sample size of fewer than 30 participants, and poor-quality articles. This review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42023406524), whereas to assess the quality of the studies, we used the quality assessment tools developed by the BSA Medical Sociology Group for cross-sectional studies and the QATSO for the longitudinal studies. Thirty-two studies were included. Some studies reported changes to promote healthy lifestyles; 13 out of 15 articles reported an increase in healthy diet consumption habits, 5 out of 7 studies reported a decrease in alcohol consumption, and 2 out of 3 studies reported a decrease in tobacco use. On the other hand, the other studies reported changes to promote unhealthy lifestyles: 9 out of 15, and 2 out of 7 studies reported an increase in unhealthy diet and alcohol consumption habits respectively, 25 out of 25 reported a decrease in physical activity, and 13 out of 13 reported an increase in sedentary behavior. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been changes to promote a healthy and unhealthy lifestyle; the latter can affect people\u2019s health. Therefore, effective responses are needed to mitigate the consequences.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review and meta-analysis were employed to address the associated factors of gender-based violence (GBV) in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed. Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science were used to source articles with stringent eligibility criteria. A total of 4931 studies were found and 50 studies met the inclusion criteria. Pooled meta-analyses revealed that low educational attainment, higher alcohol consumption, substance use, history of child and family abuse, limited decision-making skills, experiencing depression, males having multiple sexual partners, and younger age were found to be individual- and family-associated factors that increase the experiences of GBV. Community tolerant attitudes to violence, women\u2019s unemployment, being Muslim, lower socioeconomic class, food and social insecurity were found to be community- and societal-associated factors of GBV. Alcohol consumption, low educational attainment, experiencing depression, being younger, a history of child and family abuse, tolerant attitudes to violence, and low socioeconomic status were poignant factors associated with GBV amongst women in SSA countries. The need to develop a multipronged approach of intervention is a top priority in SSA to reach the Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 (SDGs) target of 2030 to eliminate all forms of violence. Socio-behavioural change communication interventions at individual and community levels need to be introduced, and interventions need to address the prevention of child and family abuse and increase women\u2019s feelings of empowerment in order to prevent GBV in SSA.",

    "title": "Unemployment and Substance Use: An Updated Review of Studies from North America and Europe",
    "abstract": "Since the industrial revolution, the relationship between unemployment and psychiatric disorders has been a subject of high interest. Currently, regarding the correlation between unemployment and substance-use disorders (SUDs), only older, often isolated and fragmented research results are available in the literature. This review was based on an extensive literature search of the European and North American literature in most relevant databases for \u201cunemployment\u201d and \u201csubstance use\u201d related to \u201cdrugs\u201d, \u201calcohol\u201d, \u201cnicotine\u201d, and \u201ctobacco\u201d between November 2022 and January 2023, according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A total of 59,117 papers were identified, of which only 33 articles were identified as relevant to the research objective. The literature showed significantly higher prevalence rates of SUDs involving divergent psychotropic substances among unemployed people. Unemployment was found to be a risk factor for SUD, and vice versa. However, the correlation between unemployment and relapses or smoking cessation was inconsistent. In addition, there appeared to be a mild effect of business cycles on SUD. The results showed significant multifaceted correlations between unemployment and SUD, indicating that prevention and early intervention are required to prevent harmful psychosocial consequences, such as social disintegration and severe psychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "Associations of parenting styles with substance use in the offspring\u2014A systematic review and meta\u2010analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Issues Parenting styles have been suggested to predict the use of psychoactive substances in the offspring, although the size of associations might vary between cultures. The present meta\u2010analysis tested whether parenting styles show concurrent and longitudinal associations with substance use and whether this association is moderated by study characteristics. Approach A systematic search in electronic data bases resulted in 184 studies that were included in multi\u2010level meta\u2010analysis. Key Findings An authoritative parenting style correlated with lower substance use (r\u2009=\u22120.12, confidence interval [CI] \u22120.14 to \u22120.10) while the reverse was found for neglectful (r\u2009=\u20090.10, CI 0.08 to 0.13), permissive (r\u2009=\u20090.04, CI 0.01 to 0.07) and authoritarian parenting (r\u2009=\u20090.03, CI 0.00 to 0.05). Analysis of cross\u2010lagged effects found only an effect of authoritative parenting on decline of substance use (r\u2009=\u2009\u22120.06, CI \u22120.12 to \u22120.00). The size of associations varied, in part, by levels of horizontal and vertical collectivism or individualism, assessment of three versus four parenting styles, type of substance, and use of same versus different informants for assessing parenting and substance use. Implications Parenting styles show small to very small associations with substance use. Conclusions Although parents are recommended to behave in an authoritative manner, we should have only modest expectations about the effects of parenting styles on substance use in the offspring.",

The objective of this study is to determine the gender-specific risk of suicidal behaviors (suicide attempt and death by suicide) for different levels and dimensions of alcohol use\u2014i.e., for (1) average alcohol volume consumed, (2) binge drinking, and (3) individuals with an alcohol use disorder. Methods We will systematically search the available literature for primary studies on the risk relationships specified above. Using a predetermined set of keywords, a comprehensive systematic literature search will be conducted in the following electronic databases: Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. The basic inclusion criteria will be (1) an original, quantitative (cohort, case\u2013control or cross-sectional) study; with (2) a measure of risk of at least one dimension of our alcohol exposures in relation to at least one of our outcomes of interest (suicide attempt or death by suicide), and its corresponding measure of variability is reported (or sufficient data to calculate these); and (3) estimates of risk stratified by gender. Studies (1) that use only qualitative labels of alcohol use, and (2) where suicide attempt and non-suicidal self-harm cannot be disaggregated will be excluded. There will be no restrictions on language, geographical region, or year of publication. Two reviewers will independently perform the search and systematic assessment of each identified study and subsequent extraction of data. Categorical random-effects meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain gender-specific pooled risk estimates. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies\u2014of Interventions tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach will be used to rate the quality of evidence. Discussion This study will synthesize all available data on the gender-specific relationship between various dimensions of alcohol use and suicidal behavior simultaneously in a coherent framework. We will provide risk estimates with the detail needed to better understand the respective risk relationships and appreciate the burden of alcohol-attributable suicide.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of digital interventions addressing depressive symptoms and alcohol use simultaneously among people with co-occurring depression and problematic alcohol use. Methods Seven databases were searched for trials evaluating digital interventions aimed at depression and alcohol use. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool effects on depressive symptoms and alcohol use up to 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Overall quality for every outcome was assessed with GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Results The pooled effect of digital interventions compared to their comparators was in favour of digital interventions. Small but significant effects on depressive symptoms at 3-month follow-up were found (g = 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06\u20130.62, P = 0.02, k = 6) and non-significant effects at 6-month follow-up (g = 0.29, 95% CI: \u22120.16 to 0.73, P = 0.15, k = 5). For alcohol use, the pooled effect of digital interventions was small and non-significant at 3-month follow-up (g = 0.14, 95% CI: \u22120.02 to 0.30, P = 0.07, k = 6) and significant at 6-month follow-up (g = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.07\u20130.20, P = 0.005, k = 5). Sensitivity analysis indicated the latter finding to be sensitive to statistical estimator choice. Quality of evidence was moderate, except for depressive symptoms at 6-month follow-up for which it was low. Conclusion Based on the literature, digital interventions are effective in reducing depressive symptoms at 3-month follow-up and alcohol use at 6-month follow-up among people with comorbid depression and problematic alcohol use. More high-quality trials are needed to confirm the current findings.",

Meta-analyses were conducted to quantify the unique associations between alcohol use outcomes and each Big Five personality domains over and above other domains. Within each domain, meta-analyses also were conducted to examine the unique contribution of each personality facet in predicting alcohol use outcomes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSystematic literature reviews were performed in PsycINFO and PubMed using keywords related to alcohol use and personality. Peer-reviewed and unpublished studies were screened and coded for the meta-analyses. A total of 80 independent samples were subjected to correlated effects meta-regressions.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOver and above other Big Five personality domains, both conscientiousness and agreeableness were negatively correlated with alcohol consumption, risky/hazardous drinking and negative drinking-related consequences. Facet-level analyses indicated that deliberation and dutifulness were uniquely associated with alcohol (mis)use over and above other conscientiousness facets, and compliance and straightforwardness were uniquely associated with alcohol (mis)use over and above other agreeableness facets. Extraversion-namely excitement seeking-was correlated with alcohol consumption, whereas neuroticism-namely impulsiveness and angry hostility-was correlated with negative drinking-related consequences.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonality characteristics are robust correlates of alcohol (mis)use. Examining relevant narrowband traits can inform mechanisms by which personality affects drinking behaviors and related problems, and ways to enhance clinical interventions for alcohol use disorder.

    "title": "Association of E-cigarettes with adolescent alcohol use and binge drinking-drunkenness: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: E-cigarette (ECIG) use has increased substantially in the past decade. Co-use of alcohol and ECIGS may have serious consequences in adolescents. Objectives: To evaluate the association of e-cigarettes (ECIGs) with alcohol use in adolescents. Methods: Searched databases included PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and gray literature. Studies were included if they contained a non-E-cigarette group (NON-ECIG), an ECIG group, detailed rates of alcohol use, binge drinking, or drunkenness and included adolescents. Two independent reviewers extracted data using MOOSE guidelines. Evidence quality across studies was assessed using Cochrane GRADE methodology. Summary effects of ECIG vs. NON-ECIG use on any alcohol use and a composite of binge drinking/drunkenness were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: 28 of 3768 initially identified studies were included: 25 cross-sectional, 3 cohort studies, N = 458,357 total subjects (49.6% females). Pooling of data showed that ECIG users had a higher risk for any alcohol use compared to NON-ECIG users (Odds Ratio/OR 6.62, 95% confidence interval/CI 5.67\u20137.72) and a higher rate of binge drinking/drunkenness compared to NON-ECIG users (OR 6.73, 95% CI 4.5 \u2212 10.07). The subset of high school ECIG users had higher rates of alcohol use (OR 8.17, 95% CI 5.95\u201311.2) and binge drinking/drunkenness (OR 7.98, 95% CI 5.98\u201310.63) compared to NON-ECIG users. Conclusion: ECIG users had a higher risk of alcohol use and binge drinking/drunkenness compared to NON-ECIG users. Our findings indicate that interventions to reduce ECIG use should be coupled with measures to reduce alcohol use in adolescents.Abbreviations: ECIG: e-cigarettes; NON-ECIG: non e-cigarettes",

The meta-analysis identified multiple risk factors associated with unemployment, including suboptimal self-rated general health [hazard ratio (HR) 1.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.70], mental health conditions [HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.30-1.68, particularly depressive symptoms (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.76)], low job control (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.17-1.43), and lack of physical activity (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.13-2.15). Additionally, a higher risk of unemployment was observed among individuals with \u226412 years of education (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00-1.36), those who are unmarried, separated, or widowed (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14-1.79), and immigrants (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.11-1.44). Age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, diabetes, neoplasm, and limitations in daily activities did not increase unemployment risk. This meta-analysis highlights the impact of mental health conditions, low job control, and lack of leisure-time physical activity on unemployment risk among middle-aged workers. Interventions aimed at improving mental health and increasing job control and physical activity could reduce unemployment risk.",

    "title": "What are the risk factors of non-fatal overdose among persons who use opioids? A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Non-fatal opioid overdose (NFOD) is a concerning public health issue that is a risk factor for subsequent fatal overdose. This systematic review aimed to evaluate all the previous literature using a self-report method to investigate the risk factors of NFOD. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRSIMA) and its 27-item checklist guided the conduct and reporting of this systematic review. The review used the population, risk factor, and outcome (PRO) framework. The population was studies with a majority of participants that regularly used opioids. Risk factors were demographic, medical, and behavioral characteristics. The outcomes were self-reported recent (<12\u00a0months) or lifetime presence of NFOD. The study explored seven databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ProQuest, and Web of Science and used Google Scholar to search for grey literature. A risk of bias assessment was carried out using ROBANS-E and meta-analysis was performed using STATA. The review discovered 53 studies using the self-report experience of persons who use opioids assessing different factors associated with NFOD. Involvement in the sex trade, having a lower than typical education, previous incarceration, experiencing homelessness, unemployment, psychiatric co-morbidity, suicidal ideation or behavior, polysubstance use, especially benzodiazepine use and problematic alcohol use, needing help injecting, former opioid agonist therapy (OAT) engagement, previous treatment experiences, and a hepatitis-C diagnosis were associated with an increased likelihood of NFOD. Current engagement in OAT was protective against NFOD. Gender, relationship status, needle exchange use, symptoms of anxiety, and being HIV positive were not strongly associated with a difference in NFOD likelihood. Using the findings from above to identify the individuals who are at high risk for NFOD, particularly those using opioids, will enable a targeted approach to outreach and education programs based on the identified risk factors- such as polysubstance use, socioeconomic associations, and psychiatric co-morbidities, which can help reduce the occurrence of NFOD.",

    "title": "Outreach programs to improve life circumstances and prevent further adverse developmental trajectories of at-risk youth in OECD countries: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "At-risk youth may be defined as a diverse group of young people in unstable life circumstances, who are currently experiencing or are at risk of developing one or more serious problems. At-risk youth are often very unlikely to seek out help for themselves within the established venues, as their adverse developmental trajectories have installed a lack of trust in authorities such as child protection agencies and social workers. To help this population, a number of outreach programmes have been established seeking to help the young people on an ad hoc basis, meaning that the interventions are designed to fit the individual needs of each young person rather than as a one-size-fits-all treatment model. The intervention in this review is targeted outreach work which may be (but does not have to be) multicomponent programmes in which outreach may be combined with other services. The main objective of this review was to answer the following research questions: What are the effects of outreach programmes on problem/high-risk behaviour of young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries? Are they less likely to experience an adverse outcome such as school failure or drop-out, runaway and homelessness, substance and/or alcohol abuse, unemployment, long-term poverty, delinquency and more serious criminal behaviour? We identified relevant studies through electronic searches of bibliographic databases, governmental and grey literature repositories, hand search in specific targeted journals, citation tracking, and Internet search engines. The database searches were carried out in September 2020 and other resources were searched in October and November 2021. We searched to identify both published and unpublished literature, and reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews were searched. The intervention was targeted outreach work which may have been combined with other services. Young people between 8 and 25 years of age living in OECD countries, who either have experienced or is at-risk of experiencing an adverse outcome were eligible. Our primary focus was on measures of problem/high-risk behaviour and a secondary focus was on social and emotional outcomes. All study designs that used a well-defined control group were eligible for inclusion. Studies that utilised qualitative approaches were not included. The total number of potentially relevant studies constituted 17,659 hits. A total of 16 studies (17 different interventions) met the inclusion criteria. Only five studies could be used in the data synthesis. Eight studies could not be used in the data synthesis as they were judged to have critical risk of bias and, in accordance with the protocol, were excluded from the meta-analysis on the basis that they would be more likely to mislead than inform. Two studies (three interventions) did not provide enough information enabling us to calculate an effect size and standard error, and one study did not provide enough information to assess risk of bias. Meta-analysis of all outcomes were conducted on each conceptual outcome separately. All analyses were inverse variance weighted using random effects statistical models incorporating both the sampling variance and between study variance components into the study level weights. Random effects weighted mean effect sizes were calculated using 95% confidence intervals. Too few studies were included to carry out any sensitivity analyses. Four of the five studies used for meta analysis were from the USA and one was from Canada. The timespan in which included studies were carried out was 32 years, from 1985 to 2017; on average the intervention year was 2005. The average number of participants in the analysed interventions was 116, ranging from 30 to 346 and the average number of controls was 81, ranging from 32 to 321. At most, the results from two studies could be pooled in a single meta-analysis. It was only possible to pool the outcomes drug (other than marijuana) use, marijuana use and alcohol use each at two different time points (one and 3 months follow up). At 1 month follow up the weighted averages varied between zero and 0.05 and at 3 months follow up between -0.17 and 0.07. None of them were statistically significant. In addition, a number of other outcomes were reported in a single study only. Overall, there were too few studies included in any of the meta-analyses in order for us to draw any conclusion concerning the effectiveness of outreach. The vast majority of studies were undertaken in the USA. The dominance of the USA as the main country in which outreach interventions meeting our inclusion criteria have been evaluated using rigorous methods and within our specific parameters clearly limits the generalisability of the findings. None of the studies, however, was considered to be of overall high quality in our risk of bias assessment and the process of excluding studies with critical risk of bias from the meta-analysis applied in this review left us with only five of a total of 16 possible studies to synthesise. Further, because too few studies reported results on the same type of outcome at most two studies could be combined in a particular meta-analysis. Given the limited number of rigorous studies available from countries other than the USA, it would be natural to consider conducting a series of randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of outreach for at-risk youth in countries outside the USA. The trial(s) should be designed, conducted and reported according to methodological criteria for rigour in respect of internal and external validity to achieve robust results and preferably reporting a larger number of outcomes.",

    "title": "Employment Status and Alcohol-Attributable Mortality Risk-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Being unemployed has been linked to various health burdens. In particular, there appears to be an association between unemployment and alcohol-attributable deaths. However, risk estimates presented in a previous review were based on only two studies. Thus, we estimated updated sex-stratified alcohol-attributable mortality risks for unemployed compared with employed individuals. A systematic literature search was conducted in August 2020 using the following databases: Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The relative risk (RR) of dying from an alcohol-attributable cause of death for unemployed compared with employed individuals was summarized using sex-stratified random-effects DerSimonian-Laird meta-analyses. A total of 10 studies were identified, comprising about 14.4 million women and 19.0 million men, among whom there were about 3147 and 17,815 alcohol-attributable deaths, respectively. The pooled RRs were 3.64 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.04-6.66) and 4.93 (95% CI 3.45-7.05) for women and men, respectively. The findings of our quantitative synthesis provide evidence that being unemployed is associated with an over three-fold higher risk of alcohol-attributable mortality compared with being employed. Consequently, a global public health strategy connecting brief interventions and specialized care with social services assisting those currently unemployed is needed.",

In the current research, 22 primary studies published between January 2005 and January 2019 were investigated. Low educational and income levels of both the woman and her partner, unintended marriage and pregnancy, living in a crowded family, a high number of children and a history of violence, unemployment of the partner, and the consumption of alcohol are the most significant risk factors of IPVP. This study shows that violence against women, which is a serious problem in Turkey as well as all over the world, also continues in a critical period, such as the pregnancy period.",

    "title": "Pharmacological interventions for antisocial personality disorder.",
    "abstract": "Antisocial personality disorder (AsPD) is associated with rule-breaking, criminality, substance use, unemployment, relationship difficulties, and premature death. Certain types of medication (drugs) may help people with AsPD. This review updates a previous Cochrane review, published in 2010. To assess the benefits and adverse effects of pharmacological interventions for adults with AsPD. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, 13 other databases and two trials registers up to 5 September 2019. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors to identify studies. Randomised controlled trials in which adults (age 18 years and over) with a diagnosis of AsPD or dissocial personality disorder were allocated to a pharmacological intervention or placebo control condition. Four authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We assessed risk of bias and created 'Summary of findings tables' and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework. The primary outcomes were: aggression; reconviction; global state/global functioning; social functioning; and adverse events. We included 11 studies (three new to this update), involving 416 participants with AsPD. Most studies (10/11) were conducted in North America. Seven studies were conducted exclusively in an outpatient setting, one in an inpatient setting, and one in prison; two studies used multiple settings. The average age of participants ranged from 28.6 years to 45.1 years (overall mean age 39.6 years). Participants were predominantly (90%) male. Study duration ranged from 6 to 24 weeks, with no follow-up period. Data were available from only four studies involving 274 participants with AsPD. All the available data came from unreplicated, single reports, and did not allow independent statistical analysis to be conducted. Many review findings were limited to descriptive summaries based on analyses carried out and reported by the trial investigators. No study set out to recruit participants on the basis of having AsPD; many participants presented primarily with substance abuse problems. The studies reported on four primary outcomes and six secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes were aggression (six studies) global/state functioning (three studies), social functioning (one study), and adverse events (seven studies). Secondary outcomes were leaving the study early (eight studies), substance misuse (five\u00a0studies), employment status (one study), impulsivity (one study), anger (three studies), and\u00a0mental state (three studies). No study reported data on the primary outcome of reconviction or the secondary outcomes of quality of life, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment, housing/accommodation\u00a0status, economic outcomes or prison/service outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0 Eleven different drugs were compared with placebo, but data for AsPD participants were only available for five comparisons. Three classes of drug were represented: antiepileptic; antidepressant; and dopamine agonist (anti-Parkinsonian) drugs. We considered selection bias to be unclear in 8/11 studies, attrition bias to be high in 7/11 studies, and performance bias to be low in 7/11 studies. Using GRADE, we rated the certainty of evidence for each outcome in this review as very low, meaning that we have very little confidence in the effect estimates reported. Phenytoin (antiepileptic) versus placebo One study (60 participants) reported very low-certainty evidence that phenytoin (300 mg/day), compared to placebo, may reduce the mean frequency of aggressive acts per week (phenytoin mean = 0.33, no standard deviation (SD) reported; placebo mean = 0.51, no SD reported) in male prisoners with aggression (skewed data) at endpoint (six weeks). The same study (60 participants) reported no evidence of difference between phenytoin and placebo in the number of participants reporting the adverse event of nausea during week one (odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 16.76; very low-certainty evidence). The study authors also reported that no important side effects were detectable via blood cell counts or liver enzyme tests (very low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure reconviction, global/state functioning or social functioning. Desipramine (antidepressant) versus placebo One study (29 participants) reported no evidence of a difference between desipramine (250 to 300 mg/day) and placebo on mean social functioning scores (desipramine = 0.19; placebo = 0.21), assessed with the family-social domain of the Addiction Severity Index (scores range from zero to one, with higher values indicating worse social functioning), at endpoint (12 weeks) (very low-certainty evidence). Neither of the studies included in this comparison measured the other primary outcomes: aggression; reconviction; global/state functioning; or adverse events. Nortriptyline (antidepressant) versus placebo One study (20 participants) reported no evidence of a difference between nortriptyline (25 to 75 mg/day) and placebo on mean global state/functioning scores (nortriptyline = 0.3; placebo = 0.7), assessed with the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90) Global Severity Index (GSI; mean of subscale scores, ranging from zero to four, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms), at endpoint (six months) in men with alcohol dependency (very low-certainty evidence). The study measured side effects but did not report data on adverse events for the AsPD subgroup. The study did not measure aggression, reconviction or social functioning. Bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) versus placebo One study (18 participants) reported no evidence of difference between bromocriptine (15 mg/day) and placebo on mean global state/functioning scores (bromocriptine = 0.4; placebo = 0.7), measured with the GSI of the SCL-90 at endpoint (six months) (very low-certainty evidence). The study did not provide data on adverse effects, but reported that 12 patients randomised to the bromocriptine group experienced severe side effects, five of whom dropped out of the study in the first two days due to nausea and severe flu-like symptoms (very low-certainty evidence). The study did not measure aggression, reconviction and social functioning. Amantadine (dopamine agonist) versus placebo The study in this comparison did not measure any of the primary outcomes. The evidence summarised in this review is insufficient to draw any conclusion about the use of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder. The evidence comes from single, unreplicated studies of mostly older medications. The studies also have methodological issues that severely limit the confidence we can draw from their results. Future studies should recruit participants on the basis of having AsPD, and use relevant outcome measures, including reconviction.",

    "title": "Associations between national development indicators and the age profile of people who inject drugs: results from a global systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Globally, an estimated 15\u00b76 million people inject drugs. We aimed to investigate global variation in the age profile of people who inject drugs (PWID), identify country-level factors associated with age of PWID, and assess the association between injecting drug use (IDU) in young people and rates of injecting and sexual risk behaviours at the country level. We derived data from a previously published global systematic review done in April, 2016 (and updated in June, 2017) on the percentage of young PWID, duration of IDU, average age of PWID, average age at IDU initiation, and the percentage of PWID reporting sexual and injecting risk behaviours. We also derived national development indicators from World Bank data. We estimated the percentage of young PWID for each country, using a random-effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird methodology) and generated pooled regional and global estimates for all indicators of IDU in young people. We used univariable and multivariable generalised linear models to test for associations between the age indicators and country urban population growth, youth unemployment percentage, the percentage of PWID who are female, the percentage of the general population aged 15-24 years, Gini coefficient, opioid substitution therapy coverage (per PWID per year), gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (US$1000), and sexual and injecting risk behaviours. In the original systematic review, data on age of PWID was reported in 741 studies across 93 countries. Globally, 25\u00b73% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 19\u00b76-31\u00b78) of PWID were aged 25 years or younger. The highest percentage of young PWID resided in eastern Europe (43\u00b74%, 95% UI 39\u00b74-47\u00b74), and the lowest percentage resided in the Middle East and north Africa (6\u00b79%, 5\u00b71-8\u00b78). At the country level, in multivariable analysis higher GDP was associated with longer median injecting duration (0\u00b711 years per $1000 GDP increase, 95% CI 0\u00b704-0\u00b718; p=0\u00b7002), and older median age of PWID (0\u00b713 years per $1000 increase, 0\u00b706-0\u00b720; p<0\u00b70001). Urban population growth was associated with higher age at IDU initiation (1\u00b740 years per annual percentage change, 0\u00b741-2\u00b740). No associations were identified between indicators of IDU in young people and youth unemployment, Gini coefficient, or opioid substitution therapy coverage provision at the country level. No associations were identified between injecting and sexual risk behaviours and age of PWID. Variation in the age profile of PWID was associated with GDP and urbanisation. Regions with the highest prevalence of young PWID (aged \u226425 years) had low coverage of interventions to prevent the spread of blood-borne viruses. Data quality highlights the need for improvements in monitoring of PWID populations.

    "title": "Prevalence Rate and Risk Factors of Victimization in Adult Patients With a Psychotic Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Psychotic disorders often have been linked with violence. However, studies have shown that people with a psychotic disorder are more often victim than perpetrator of violence. The objective of this meta-analysis was to review prevalence rates for different types of victimization and to identify risk factors associated with victimization. Based on a search in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, 27 studies were found with samples consisting of adults with a psychotic disorder and possible victimization occurring during adulthood and data on \"violent victimization,\" \"sexual victimization,\" \"non-violent victimization,\" and/or \"victimization not otherwise specified.\" The median prevalence rate for violent victimization was 20%, for sexual victimization 20%, nonviolent victimization 19%, and for victimization not otherwise specified 19%. Victimization rates were approximately 4-6 times higher than in the general community. Meta-analyses showed the following significant risk factors: delusion (OR = 1.69), hallucinations (OR = 1.70), manic symptoms (OR = 1.66), drugs (OR = 1.90) or alcohol abuse (OR = 2.05), perpetration of a crime (OR = 4.33), unemployment (OR = 1.31), and homelessness (OR = 2.49). Other risk factors like previous victimization, impaired social functioning, personality disorder, and living in a disadvantaged neighborhood were found only in 1 or 2 studies. Based on the results, we conclude that, depending on the examined time period, 1 in 5 (assessment period \u22643 y) or 1 in 3 (assessment period entire adulthood) people with a psychotic disorder was victim of a crime. Clinical, behavioral, and sociodemographic factors were significantly associated with victimization, as well as previous victimization. Prospective research into risk factors is needed to capture causal trajectories of victimization.",

    "abstract": "Optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy is closely related with suppression of the HIV viral load in plasma, slowing disease progression and decreasing HIV transmission rates. Despite its importance, the estimated proportion of people living with HIV in Latin America and the Caribbean with optimal adherence has not yet been reported in a meta-analysis. Moreover, little is known of the factors leading to poor adherence which may be setting-specific. We present a pooled estimate of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) of people living with HIV in Latin America and Caribbean, report the methods used to measure adherence and describe the factors associated with poor adherence among the selected studies. We electronically searched published studies up to July 2016 on the PubMed, Web of Science and Virtual Health Library (Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Portal); considering the following databases: MEDLINE, LILACS, PAHO and IBECS. Two independent reviewers selected and extracted data on ART adherence and study characteristics. Pooled estimate of adherence was derived using a random-effects model. Risk of bias in individual studies was assessed independently by two investigators using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS).

    "abstract": "Young adults receiving RRT face additional challenges in life. The effect of established kidney failure on young adulthood is uncertain. We aimed to establish the psychosocial and lifestyle status of young adults receiving RRT. Our study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16-30-year olds receiving RRT compared with the general population. We selected randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; or cross-sectional studies without language restriction and extracted proportions of sociodemographic and lifestyle outcomes or validated psychologic health tests producing quality of life, wellbeing, and self-esteem scores. We undertook random effects meta-analysis. There were 60 studies with a total of 15,575 participants. Studies were largely single-center cross-sectional studies of those transplanted in childhood. Compared with healthy peers, young adults on RRT had lower quality of life, which was worse for patients on dialysis (seven studies: standardized mean difference, -1.01; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -1.32 to -0.70) compared with patients with transplants (nine studies: standardized mean difference, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.20). They were more likely to be unemployed (seven studies: relative risk, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.47 to 2.44) and live in the family home (two studies: relative risk, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.43). They were less likely to be married or have a partner (four studies: relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). Higher education (three studies: relative risk, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.51), alcohol abstinence (three studies: relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 0.84 to 4.67), and smoking status (two studies: relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.44) did not differ. Results were limited by high heterogeneity and a small evidence base, biased toward surviving patients. Established kidney failure is associated with lower quality of life in young people and limited employment, independence, and relationships compared with healthy peers.

    "title": "Job insecurity amid the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: a systematic review and research agenda",
    "abstract": "PurposeThe catastrophic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have considerably impacted the labour market and increased job insecurity among workers. This study systematically reviews the literature on job insecurity conducted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic with three key objectives. First, to identify the key antecedents of job insecurity during the pandemic. Second, to identify the outcomes associated with job insecurity during the pandemic. Third, to identify the underlying boundary conditions that strengthened or alleviated the association between the antecedents of job insecurity and its associated outcomes.Design/methodology/approachThe study followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines for the selection and inclusion of scientific literature by systematically searching five electronic databases, namely, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science and Psych Info.FindingsA perception of health-related risks, negative economic consequences and organizational restructuring during the pandemic were the primary factors contributing to job insecurity among workers. The consequences encompassed detrimental impacts on health and well-being, proactive measures undertaken by employees to alleviate the threat of job loss, and a variety of tactics employed to cope with stress arising from job insecurity. The boundary conditions elucidate the factors that alleviated job insecurity among workers and influenced both their work and non-work outcomes.Originality/valueThis is the first systematic review summarizing the literature on employees' experiences with job insecurity amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a systematic review, this study provides doable steps that HR managers can take to effectively manage job insecurity among workers, particularly during a crisis.",

    "title": "Alcohol use, alcohol use disorder and heavy episodic drinking in the Eastern Mediterranean region: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AMS\nDespite the evident public health impact, the extent and patterns of alcohol use in the Eastern Mediterranean countries remain understudied. The latest estimation for the last 12-month use of alcohol in the region was 2.9% in 2016 by the World Health Organization. We reviewed the main indicators for alcohol consumption in the region since 2010.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe systematically searched on-line databases until September 2023, together with other global and regional sources for studies on the adult general population (aged \u2265\u200915\u2009years) and young general populations (aged <\u200918\u2009years) and studies on the treatment-seeking individuals with substance use in Eastern Mediterranean countries. Studies were included from 22 countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 148 were included (n\u2009=\u200995 on the prevalence of alcohol use, n\u2009=\u200946 on the prevalence of alcohol use disorder, regular use and heavy episodic drinking, n\u2009=\u200935 on alcohol use pattern among people who use substances and one report on alcohol per capita consumption, n\u2009=\u200929 had data for more than one category). The pooled prevalence of the last 12-month alcohol use in the adult general population was 9.5% [95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20096.4-13.7] among males, 2.8% (95% CI\u2009=\u20091.3-5.5\\) among females and 6.2% (95% CI\u2009=\u20093.9-9.6) in both sexes in the region, with notable subregional variations. Data on the prevalence of alcohol use disorder and heavy drinking were limited to several countries, with heterogeneous indicators. The pooled estimate of alcohol as the primary substance of use among treatment-seeking people who used substances was 16.9% (95% CI\u2009=\u20098.8-26.9).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMore than 30 million adults in the Eastern Mediterranean region used alcohol in the last 12\u2009months, with a prevalence of 6.2%. This is far fewer than the global estimate of 43% of the population aged 15\u2009years and above, but is approximately two times more than the previous estimate (2.9%), reported by the World Health Organization in 2016, which might show an increasing trend.",

    "abstract": "A number of studies analyze the link between the presence of psychosocial risk factors and work\u2010related musculoskeletal disorders. The increase in job insecurity (JI) has resulted in a growing focus on its likely role as a risk factor within occupational health. Accordingly, the aim of this research was to carry out a systematic review of studies that include JI among the relevant risk factors, specifically drawing data from this variable to observe the significance of its association with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). For this purpose, a literature search was carried out: from a sample of 859 studies found and 23 were selected after applying the eligibility criteria. Fifteen studies (65.2% of the selection) presented statistically significant results regarding the link between JI and MSDs: the upper limbs and back were the body areas most affected by this association. In sum, JI should be considered a potential precursor of MSDs. Therefore, further study on this psychosocial risk and its association with these types of pathologies is necessary.",

    "title": "\u201cDoctor, Can I Drink an Alcohol-Free Beer?\u201d Low-Alcohol and Alcohol-Free Drinks in People with Heavy Drinking or Alcohol Use Disorders: Systematic Review of the Literature",
    "abstract": "No- and low-alcohol drinks (NoLo) have been proposed as a potential way forward for the reduction in the alcohol burden of disease. So far, there is scarce synthesized evidence on the effects of these products on people with alcohol use disorder (AUD), or with a heavy or high-risk drinking pattern. The aim of the present study is to systematically review the evidence of the use of NoLo drinks in these populations. A total of 4045 records were screened and 10 studies were included in the review. Craving and desire to drink have been found to increase after the consumption of NoLo drinks in patients with AUD. The increase in craving correlates with the severity of alcohol dependence. In addition, in this population, alcohol-related cues might trigger physiological responses similar to those experienced when using alcohol. Furthermore, as mentioned, in some of the studies, consumption was shown to increase as the %ABV or verbal descriptors indicate lower alcohol. Last, according to the epidemiological data, heavy drinkers tend to use NoLo drinks on top of their usual alcohol consumption rather than as part of regular drinking patterns. Further studies should be conducted in people with AUD or people with a high-risk drinking pattern to provide new insight to guide clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders to make evidence-based informed decisions.",

    "title": "The relationship between job insecurity and employee performance: a systematic literature review and research agenda",
    "abstract": "PurposeAlthough research on job insecurity (JI) and its relationship with employee performance has increased in recent years, results are mixed and inconclusive. The objectives of this paper are to explore 1) the conceptualizations of JI, 2) the relationship between JI and different performance dimensions, 3) the theoretical perspectives used to explain the JI\u2013performance relationship and 4) the mechanisms and contextual boundaries that affect the JI\u2013performance relationship.Design/methodology/approachFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, the authors systematically searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies published before July 2021 in Web of Science and Scopus. The authors analyzed 81 empirical studies published on the conceptualization of job insecurity, its relationship with employee performance, and what mechanisms and contingency factors are studied. The authors used thematic analysis to analyze the articles.FindingsResults of this review show that the quantitative cognitive dimension is dominant in extant JI literature. Furthermore, in-role performance and OCB were most often investigated in relation to the four dimensions of job insecurity, drawing from a range of theoretical perspectives to explain this relationship. Moreover, a variety of mechanisms and contextual factors on individual, individual work-related, individual-level attitudes and job-level characteristics have found to play a role in this relationship.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has a number of limitations. The first pertains to the exclusion of articles in languages other than English and non-peer reviewed papers. It is possible that the search strategy used may not have identified other studies that may have met the established criteria in order to be included in our research. However, this method was chosen to guarantee the quality of the included articles in this study and in line with previous meta-analyses and literature reviews (De Witte et\u00a0al., 2016; Sverke et\u00a0al., 2019). Second, one selection criteria focused on how performance was assessed in the studies incorporated in this literature review. The authors excluded studies that addressed performance from the perspective of the organization (i.e. studies that measured performance at the organizational level). The authors herewith might have excluded studies that focused on one or multiple job insecurity constructs, but the authors herewith included studies that were comparable in terms of performance indicator outcomes. Future studies could expand the search by investigating, as a next step, the impact on organizational performance. Finally, since the focus of this literature review was on the relationship between job insecurity and performance indicators, including the mechanisms and boundary conditions that affect this relationship, the authors did not include focus on how job insecurity can be influenced (Shoss, 2017), and herewith lack information on the predictors side of job insecurity. However, by narrowing the authors focus to mediators and moderators, the authors were able to come up with an extensive list of factors that impact the job insecurity\u2013performance relationship and herewith provide fruitful areas for future research. Future studies could expand these findings by providing an overview of predictors of different job insecurity constructs, to see whether there are potential different predictors of job insecurity conceptualizations (Jiang and Lavaysse, 2018).Practical implicationsThe study review contributes to the systematization of the current empirical evidence on this area of research. This is especially important and enables room to take an additional step toward understanding the consequences of job insecurity on performance. Specifically, it is important for organizations and policymakers to be aware of the different conceptualizations of job insecurity that exist and how they impact employee performance. In addition, an overview of potential mechanisms and boundary conditions that affect this relationship provides insights as to how organizations can intervene to affect reactions to job insecurity.Social implicationsThe study findings are relevant and may be of interest to decision makers in organizations and national authorities that must have information on quality concerning the effects of job insecurity on performance.Originality/valueBased on these findings the authors show the impact of the different conceptualizations of job insecurity and how they affect job performance. In addition, the authors provide recommendations for future studies how to better handle the integration of different conceptualizations and measures of job insecurity and its different approaches.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The contamination of water due to heavy metals (HMs) is a big concern for humankind; particularly in developing countries. This research is a systematic review, conducted by searching google scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, Springer, and Scopus databases for related published papers from 2010 to July 2021, resulting in including 40 articles. Among the analyzed HMs in the presented review, the average content of Cr, Pb, Ba, Al, As, Zn, and Cd exceeded the permissible limits suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and 1,053 Iranian standards. Also, the rank order of Hazard Quotient (HQ) of HMs was defined as Cd>As>Cr>Pb>Li for children which means Cd has the highest non-carcinogenic risk and Li has the least. This verifies to the current order As>Cr>Pb>Fe=Zn=Cu>Cd for adults. The corresponded values of HQ and Hazard Index (HI) in most cities and villages were investigated and the results indicated a lower than 1 value, which means consumers are not at non-carcinogenic risk (HQ). Carcinogenic risk (CR) of As in the adult and children consumers in most of the samples (58.82% of samples for both groups) were investigated too, and it was more than>1.00E-04 value, which determines that consumers are at significant CR.",

    "title": "The contexts of heavy drinking: A systematic review of the combinations of context-related factors associated with heavy drinking occasions",
    "abstract": "Background The amount of alcohol consumed during an occasion can be influenced by physical and social attributes of the setting, characteristics and state of individuals, and the interactions of these components. This systematic review identifies and describes the specific combinations and sequences of context-related factors that are associated with heavy drinking occasions. Materials and methods We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Eligible articles were event-level and event-based studies that quantitatively analysed associations of sequences or combinations of context-related factors with event-level alcohol consumption. We extracted information on study design, sample, variables, effect estimates and analytical methods. We compiled a list of combinations and sequences associated with heavier drinking (i.e., \u2018risky contexts\u2019) and with lighter drinking (\u2018protective contexts\u2019). The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42018089500). Results We screened 1902 retrieved records and identified a final sample of 65 eligible studies. Daily mood, day of week, location and drinking group characteristics are important drivers of whether an individual engages in a heavy drinking occasion. The direction and magnitude of some associations differed by gender, age, personality and motives, such that in particular social or physical contexts, some people may feel compelled to drink more while others are compelled to drink less. Very few sequences of factors were reported as being associated with event-level alcohol consumption. Conclusions Contexts or factors are experienced in specific sequences that shape the broader drinking context and influence drinking behaviours and consequences but are under-studied. Event-level studies such as those using ecological momentary assessment can harness new technologies for data collection and analysis to improve understandings of why people engage in heavy drinking. Continued event-level research will facilitate public health interventions and policies that reduce heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms.",

    "title": "Clinical efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Objective Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a liver damage disease caused by long-term heavy drinking. Currently, there is no targeted pharmaceutical intervention available for the treatment of this disease. To address this, this paper evaluates the efficacy and safety of probiotic preparation in treating ALD through conducting a meta-analysis, and provides a valuable insight for clinical decision-making. Methods A systematic search was conducted across databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, and CBM from the inception dates to October 15, 2023, to identify clinical randomized controlled trials on probiotic preparations in the treatment of ALD. After the literature underwent screening, data extraction, and quality assessment, RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.2 were employed for data analysis and processing. Results A total of 9 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed that probiotic preparation could significantly improve the liver function of patients with alcoholic liver disease compared with the control group. Probiotic intervention led to a significant reduction in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (MD=-13.36,95%CI:-15.80,-10.91;P<0.00001),aspartate aminotransferase (MD=-16.99,95%CI:-20.38,-13.59;P<0.00001),\u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (MD=-18.79,95% CI:-28.23,-9.34; P<0.0001). Concurrently, the level of serum albumin (MD=0.19,95% CI:0.02,0.36;P=0.03) was increased. Furthermore, probiotic intervention could also modulate the composition of intestinal flora in patients with alcoholic liver disease, leading to an augmentation in Bifidobacteria and a reduction in Escherichia coli. However, in patients with alcoholic liver disease, probiotic intervention showed no significant effects on total bilirubin (MD=-0.01,95% CI:-0.17,0.15;P=0.91), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (MD=0.03,95% CI:-0.86,0.92;P=0.94) and interleukin-6 (MD=-5.3,95% CI:-16.04,5.45;P=0.33). Conclusion The meta-analysis indicates that probiotics can improve liver function in alcoholic liver disease, reduce inflammatory responses, regulate intestinal flora, which have potential value in the treatment of alcoholic liver disease.

    "title": "Public health implications of heavy metals in foods and drinking water in Ethiopia (2016 to 2020): systematic review",
    "abstract": "Besides their benefits, heavy metals are toxic, persistent, and hazardous to human health, even at their lower concentrations. Consumption of unsafe concentrations of food contaminated with heavy metals may lead to the disruption of numerous biological and biochemical processes in the human body. In developing country including Ethiopia, where untreated or partially treated wastewater is used for agricultural purposes, the problems related to the consumption foods contaminated with heavy metals may poses highest risk to human health. Therefore, this review was aimed to determine the public health implications of heavy metals in foods and drinking water in Ethiopia. The articles published from 2016 to 2020 were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases that include MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAH, Google Scholar, WHO, and FAO Libraries. The data was extracted using a predetermined data extraction form using Microsoft Excel, 2016. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT) version 2018 and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools to determine the relevance of the studies. Finally, the results were evaluated based on the FAO/WHO guidelines for foods and drinking water. A total of 1019 articles published from 2016 to 2020 were searched from various electronic databases and by manual searching on Google. Following the initial screening, 317 articles were retrieved for evaluation and 49 articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 21 studies were included in the systematic review. The mean concentration of Cr, Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe and Mn in fruits and vegetables ranged from 2.068\u20134.29, 0.86\u20131.37, 1.90\u20134.70, 1.01\u20133.56, 3.43\u20134.23, 19.18\u201398.15, 4.39\u20139.42, 1.037\u20135.27, 0.19\u20131.0, 199.5\u2013370.4, 0.26\u2013869\u2009mg/kg, respectively. The mean concentration Cr, Cd, Pb, As, Zn, and Fe in meat and milk ranged from 1.032\u20132.72, 0.233\u20130.72, 1.32\u20133.15, 0.79\u20132.96, 78.37\u2013467.7, and 505.61\u20133549.9\u2009mg/kg, respectively. The mean concentration of Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Cu in drinking water ranged 0.0089\u20130.054, 0.02\u20130.0237, 0.005\u20130.369, 0.625\u20132.137, and 0.176\u20131.176\u2009ml/L, respectively. The mean concentration of Cr, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, and Mn in other edible cereals ranged from 0.973\u20132.165, 0.424\u20130.55, 0.65\u20131.70, 70.51\u201381.58, 14.123\u201315.98, 1.89\u201313.8, 1.06\u20131.59, 67.866\u2013110.3, and 13.686\u201315.4\u2009mg/kg, respectively. This systematic review identified heavy metals in foods and drinking water and determined their public health implications. The results of this finding imply that the majority of the studies reported high concentrations of toxic heavy metals in foods and drinking water that are hazardous to human health. Therefore, effective food safety and risk-based food quality assessment are essential to protect the public health.",

Methods: We use a systematic review of literature \u2013 conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines \u2013 and a hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the relationship between business cycle and the use of drugs by young populations. The heterogeneity of studies was assessed by the I2 statistic, and the publication bias was evaluated with contour-enhanced funnel plots. Results: We identify 25 studies, published over the period 2008\u20132020. These articles carried out an empirical analysis of the impact of the business cycle on illegal drug consumption in Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) countries. Most of the studies (17 studies) covered the 2007 financial crisis. Among the outcomes, 9 studies traced a countercyclical relationship between economic recessions and drug use, 3 showed a procyclical relationship and 13 studies found mixed results. Unemployment was the most widely used variable to assess macroeconomic conditions in most of the studies (21 studies). The meta-analysis shows a partial correlation of .03 (95% confidence interval (CI): .0147\u2013.0453) between the unemployment rate and drug use among young individuals. Therefore, we conclude that, on average, recessions tend to boost drug use. This impact is more marked with cannabis use than it is with cocaine, opioids or other drugs. Conclusion: This study provides robust evidence that in periods of economic downturns, the young populations tend to increase the use of illegal drugs, with cannabis as their main preference. Therefore, in periods of economic severity, society may particularly benefit from implementing widely reaching public prevention programmes and demand reduction interventions, targeting this subgroup of the population.",

    "title": "Long-term exposure to transportation noise and diabetes mellitus mortality: a national cohort study and updated meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Long-term exposure to transportation noise is related to cardio-metabolic diseases, with more recent evidence also showing associations with diabetes mellitus (DM) incidence. This study aimed to evaluate the association between transportation noise and DM mortality within the Swiss National Cohort. Methods During 15 years of follow-up (2001\u20132015; 4.14\u00a0million adults), over 72,000 DM deaths were accrued. Source-specific noise was calculated at residential locations, considering moving history. Multi-exposure, time-varying Cox regression was used to derive hazard ratios (HR, and 95%-confidence intervals). Models included road traffic, railway and aircraft noise, air pollution, and individual and area-level covariates including socio-economic position. Analyses included exposure-response modelling, effect modification, and a subset analysis around airports. The main findings were integrated into meta-analyses with published studies on mortality and incidence (separately and combined). Results HRs were 1.06 (1.05, 1.07), 1.02 (1.01, 1.03) and 1.01 (0.99, 1.02) per 10 dB day evening-night level (L_den) road traffic, railway and aircraft noise, respectively (adjusted model, including NO_2). Splines suggested a threshold for road traffic noise (~\u200946 dB L_den, well below the 53 dB L_den WHO guideline level), but not railway noise. Substituting for PM_2.5, or including deaths with type 1 DM hardly changed the associations. HRs were higher for males compared to females, and in younger compared to older adults. Focusing only on type 1 DM showed an independent association with road traffic noise. Meta-analysis was only possible for road traffic noise in relation to mortality (1.08 [0.99, 1.18] per 10 dB, n \u2009=\u20094), with the point estimate broadly similar to that for incidence (1.07 [1.05, 1.09] per 10 dB, n \u2009=\u200910). Combining incidence and mortality studies indicated positive associations for each source, strongest for road traffic noise (1.07 [1.05, 1.08], 1.02 [1.01, 1.03], and 1.02 [1.00, 1.03] per 10 dB road traffic [ n \u2009=\u200914], railway [ n \u2009=\u20095] and aircraft noise [ n \u2009=\u20095], respectively). Conclusions This study provides new evidence that transportation noise is associated with diabetes mortality. With the growing evidence and large disease burden, DM should be viewed as an important outcome in the noise and health discussion.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), encompassing alcohol-associated hepatitis and alcohol-associated cirrhosis, is rising in the United States. Racial and ethnic disparities are evident within ALD; however, the precise nature of these disparities is poorly defined. Methods: We conducted a search of the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify studies published from inception through September 2023 that reported ALD incidence, prevalence, and mortality within the United States, stratified by race and ethnicity. We calculated pooled prevalence and incidence by race and ethnicity, including risk ratios and ORs for ALD pooled prevalence and alcohol-associated hepatitis/alcohol-associated cirrhosis pooled proportions, and OR for ALD mortality using the DerSimonian and Laird method for random-effect models. Results: We identified 25 relevant studies (16 for quantitative meta-analysis), comprising 76,867,544 patients. ALD prevalence was highest in Hispanic (4.5%), followed by White (3.1%) and Black (1.4%) individuals. Pooled risk ratios of ALD prevalence were 1.64 (95% CI: 1.12\u20132.39) for Hispanic and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.35\u20130.87) for Black compared to White individuals. Mortality among those with ALD did not significantly differ between White and Hispanic (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.9\u20132.5; I 2=0%), Black (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.8\u20131.6; I 2=0%), or Native American (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 0.9\u20132.9) individuals, while there was a significant difference between White and Asian (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.03\u20130.5) individuals. Most data were cross-sectional and assessed to be of poor or fair quality. Conclusions: Differences were observed in ALD epidemiology, including higher prevalence among Hispanic and lower prevalence among Black individuals, although there were smaller differences in ALD mortality. Differences in ALD prevalence and prognosis remain poorly defined based on existing data, highlighting a need for higher-quality epidemiological studies in this area.",

    "abstract": "Background: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of morbidity and premature mortality. To date, there has been no systematic synthesis of the prevalence of ALD. This systematic review was done with the aim of reporting the prevalence of ALD across different health care settings. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting the prevalence of ALD in populations subjected to a universal testing process. Single-proportion meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of all ALD, alcohol-associated fatty liver, and alcohol-associated cirrhosis, in unselected populations, primary care, and among patients with alcohol-use disorder (AUD). Results: Thirty-five studies were included reporting on 513,278 persons, including 5968 cases of ALD, 18,844 cases of alcohol-associated fatty liver, and 502 cases of alcohol-associated cirrhosis. In unselected populations, the prevalence of ALD was 3.5% (95% CI, 2.0%\u20136.0%), the prevalence in primary care was 2.6% (0.5%\u201311.7%), and the prevalence in groups with AUD was 51.0% (11.1%\u201389.3%). The prevalence of alcohol-associated cirrhosis was 0.3% (0.2%\u20130.4%) in general populations, 1.7% (0.3%\u201310.2%) in primary care, and 12.9% (4.3%\u201333.2%) in groups with AUD. Conclusions: Liver disease or cirrhosis due to alcohol is not common in general populations and primary care but very common among patients with coexisting AUD. Targeted interventions for liver disease such as case finding will be more effective in at-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE\nSepsis management relies on fluid resuscitation avoiding fluid overload and its related organ congestion.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo explore the influence of country income group on risk-benefit balance of fluid management strategies in sepsis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe searched E-databases for all randomised controlled trials on fluid resuscitation in patients with sepsis or septic shock up to January 2023, excluding studies on hypertonic fluids, colloids, and depletion-based interventions. Fluid strategies (higher versus lower volumes) effect on mortality was analysed per income group, i.e. low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) or high-income countries (HICs) Measurements and Main Results: 29 studies (11,798 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. There was a numerically higher mortality in LMICs studies as compared to HICs (37%[26-41] versus 29%[17-38], p= 0.06). Income group significantly interacted with the effect of fluid volume on mortality: higher fluid volume was associated with higher mortality in LMICs but not in HICs (OR 1.47[95% CI 1.14-1.90] vs. 1.00[95% CI 0.87-1.16], p=0.01 for subgroup differences). Higher fluid volume was associated with increased need for mechanical ventilation in LMICs (OR 1.24[95% CI 1.08-1.43]) but not in HICs (OR 1.02[95% CI 0.80-1.29]). Self-reported access to mechanical ventilation also significantly influenced the effect of fluid volume on mortality, which increased with higher volumes only in settings with limited access to mechanical ventilation (OR: 1.45[1.09-1.93]vs. 1.09[0.93-1.28], p=0.02 for subgroup differences).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn sepsis trials, the effect of fluid resuscitation approach differed by setting, with higher-volume fluid resuscitation associated with increased mortality in LMICs, and in settings with restricted access to mechanical ventilation. The precise reason for these differences is unclear, and may be attributable in part to resource constraints, participant variation between trials, or other unmeasured factors.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To identify the difference in breast cancer mortality rates among young women according to countries\u2019 economic classification. Methods: A systematic literature review included retrospective studies on breast cancer mortality rates in women aged 20 to 49 years. Databases used were PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Virtual Health Library, with articles selected in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. The study selection and analysis were conducted by two pairs of researchers. Data from 54 countries were extracted, including 39 high-income, 12 upper-middle-income, and 3 lower-middle-income countries. A meta-analysis was performed with the quantitative data from two studies. Results: Six articles met the inclusion criteria. Four were analyzed descriptively due to data diversity, and two were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mortality rate for high-income countries was 10.2 per 100,000 women (95% CI: 9.8-10.6), while for upper-middle-income countries, it was 15.5 per 100,000 women (95% CI: 14.9-16.1). Lower-middle-income countries had a pooled mortality rate of 20.3 per 100,000 women (95% CI: 19.5-21.1). The decrease in mortality rates in high-income countries was statistically significant (p<0.05). Conclusion: Mortality rates for breast cancer among young women have decreased significantly in high-income countries but have increased in lower-income countries. This disparity underscores the impact of insufficient investment in preventive measures, health promotion, early diagnosis, and treatment on young women\u2019s mortality in lower-income countries.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant contributor to global morbidity and mortality. This study investigated disparities in age, sex and socio-economic status in CKD and updated global prevalence estimates through systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Five databases were searched from 2014 to 2022, with 14 871 articles screened, 119 papers included and data analysed on 29 159 948 participants. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to determine overall prevalence, prevalence of stages 3\u20135 and prevalence in males and females. Influences of age, sex and socio-economic status were assessed in subgroup analyses and risk of bias assessment and meta-regressions were conducted to explore heterogeneity. Results The overall prevalence of CKD was 13.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.3\u201314.8] and 6.6% (95% CI 5.6\u20137.8) for stages 3\u20135. The prevalence was higher in studies of older populations (19.3% for stages 1\u20135, 15.0% for stages 3\u20135) and meta-regression demonstrated an association of age, body mass index, diabetes and hypertension with prevalence of stages 3\u20135. The prevalence of CKD stages 1\u20135 was similar in males and females (13.1% versus 13.2%), but the prevalence of stages 3\u20135 was higher in females (6.4% versus 7.5%). Overall prevalence was 11.4%, 15.0% and 10.8% in low-, middle- and high-income countries, respectively; for stages 3\u20135, prevalence was 4.0%, 6.7% and 6.8%, respectively. Included studies were at moderate\u2013high risk of bias in the majority of cases (92%) and heterogeneity was high. Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive assessment of CKD prevalence, highlighting important disparities related to age, sex and socio-economic status. Future research should focus on targeted screening and treatment approaches, improving access to care and more effective data monitoring, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.",

A systematic review of recently published cohort studies and a meta-analysis of relative risk (RR) of low compared with high socio-economic status (SES) in relation to cardiovascular incidence and mortality was conducted. Supplementary evaluations were conducted considering different proxies of SES in relation to different types of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We identified 17 studies including approximately 26.5 million of participants with more than 900,000 CVD events. We estimated a 50% increased CVD risk for low SES with respect to high SES (RR\u2009=\u20091.49 [95% confidence interval: 1.26, 1.78]). For sex-specific risk, we estimated a 79% increased CVD risk for women of low SES (RR\u2009=\u20091.79 [1.30, 2.46]).

Although not statistically significant, women of low SES were at higher CVD risk than men. CVD risk was more relevant to educational inequality than economic inequality.",

    "title": "Mental health problems among female sex workers in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background The psychological health of female sex workers (FSWs) has emerged as a major public health concern in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Key risk factors include poverty, low education, violence, alcohol and drug use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and stigma and discrimination. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the prevalence of mental health problems among FSWs in LMICs, and to examine associations with common risk factors. Method and findings The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016049179. We searched 6 electronic databases for peer-reviewed, quantitative studies from inception to 26 April 2020. Study quality was assessed with the Centre for Evidence-Based Management (CEBM) Critical Appraisal Tool. Pooled prevalence estimates were calculated for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal behaviour. Meta-analyses examined associations between these disorders and violence, alcohol/drug use, condom use, and HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI). A total of 1,046 studies were identified, and 68 papers reporting on 56 unique studies were eligible for inclusion. These were geographically diverse (26 countries), representing all LMIC regions, and included 24,940 participants. All studies were cross-sectional and used a range of measurement tools; none reported a mental health intervention. Of the 56 studies, 14 scored as strong quality, 34 scored as moderate, and 8 scored as weak. The average age of participants was 28.9 years (age range: 11\u201364 years), with just under half (46%) having up to primary education or less. The pooled prevalence rates for mental disorders among FSWs in LMICs were as follows: depression 41.8% (95% CI 35.8%\u201348.0%), anxiety 21.0% (95% CI: 4.8%\u201358.4%), PTSD 19.7% (95% CI 3.2%\u201364.6%), psychological distress 40.8% (95% CI 20.7%\u201364.4%), recent suicide ideation 22.8% (95% CI 13.2%\u201336.5%), and recent suicide attempt 6.3% (95% CI 3.4%\u201311.4%). Meta-analyses found significant associations between violence experience and depression, violence experience and recent suicidal behaviour, alcohol use and recent suicidal behaviour, illicit drug use and depression, depression and inconsistent condom use with clients, and depression and HIV infection. Key study limitations include a paucity of longitudinal studies (necessary to assess causality), non-random sampling of participants by many studies, and the use of different measurement tools and cut-off scores to measure mental health problems and other common risk factors. Conclusions In this study, we found that mental health problems are highly prevalent among FSWs in LMICs and are strongly associated with common risk factors. Study findings support the concept of overlapping vulnerabilities and highlight the urgent need for interventions designed to improve the mental health and well-being of FSWs.",

Most studies found evidence for gut dysbiosis in individuals with AUD and AALD. Microbiome intervention studies have mostly been conducted in AALD patients; fecal microbial transplant interventions show the most promise. Because most studies were conducted cross-sectionally, the causal relationship between the gut microbiome and alcohol use is unknown. Furthermore, almost all studies have been conducted in predominantly male populations, leaving critical questions regarding sex differences and generalizability of the findings. The study summaries and recommendations provided in this review seek to identify areas for further research and to highlight potential gut microbial interventions for treating AUD and AALD.",

    "title": "Testing pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder with cue exposure paradigms: A systematic review and quantitative synthesis of human laboratory trial methodology.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlcohol cue-exposure is a widely used experimental paradigm for screening pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Medication-related reductions in cue-reactivity signal early efficacy and inform medications development. Yet, across trials, the design of cue exposure, parameter testing, and outcome reporting is heterogenous. This systematic review provides a quantitative synthesis of trial methodologies and effect size estimation for AUD medication-related craving and psychophysiological outcomes under the cue exposure paradigm.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA PubMed search was conducted on January 3, 2022, based on identified pharmacotherapies for peer-reviewed articles reported in English. Study-level characteristics, including sample descriptors, paradigm design, analytic approach, and Cochrane Risk of Bias, along with descriptive statistics for cue-exposure outcomes, were coded by two independent raters. Study-level effect sizes were estimated for craving and psychophysiological outcomes separately and sample-level effect sizes were calculated for each medication.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty-six trials, comprising 1,640 participants and testing 19 different medications satisfied eligibility criteria. All studies reported on biological sex (71% male participants on average). Cue exposure paradigms implemented were in vivo (n=26), visual (n=8), and audio script cues (n=2). Relatively few trials included means for craving by medication condition in text (k=7) or figure (k=18). Quantitative synthesis included 63 effect sizes (craving kes =47; psychophysiological kes =16) from 28 unique randomized trials testing 15 medications for effects on cue-reactivity. For cue-induced craving, eight pharmacotherapies (kes range: 1-12) demonstrated small-to-medium effects (Cohen's d range: |.24 - .64|) compared to placebo, such that individuals randomized to medication reported lower craving following cue exposure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRecommendations are provided to promote further consilience, so that cue exposure paradigms can be maximized toward the development of effective AUD pharmacotherapies. Future work should explore the predictive utility of medication-related reductions in cue-reactivity on clinical outcomes.",

    "title": "Efficacy of psychosocial interventions to reduce alcohol use in comorbid alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related liver disease: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials",
    "abstract": "Abstract This systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42021234598) fills a gap in the literature by assessing the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in patients with alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), focusing on drinking reduction and abstinence as intervention goals. A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted across various databases. Study screening and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. The data were presented through narrative synthesis. Primary outcomes were alcohol reduction and abstinence at the longest follow-up. Ten RCTs were included, evaluating interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational enhancement therapy (MET), motivational interviewing, or peer support. The total population included 1519 participants. Four studies included a combination of more than one intervention, and two trialed an integrated approach, including medical and psychosocial management. A significant reduction was observed with MET, while abstinence was observed with peer support, MET, and CBT/MET within integrated treatment. The overall certainty of the evidence was moderate. Six studies presented a low risk of bias, one had some concerns, and three were high risk. The findings highlight the potential of psychosocial interventions, with MET being repeatedly associated with improved outcomes. Integrated treatment also demonstrated a promising role in ARLD. Future research should head toward improving the robustness and quality of the evidence. It should also aim to further tailor and trial new psychosocial interventions on this specific clinical population. This will enhance the translation of the evidence into real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: The relationship between cannabis use and the risk of returning to using opioids non-medically during treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) remains unclear. Objective: We sought to quantify the impact of cannabis use on the risk of non-medical opioid use among people receiving pharmacotherapies for OUD. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed using multiple databases from March 1 to April 5 of 2023. Eligible studies longitudinally assessed the association between cannabis use and non-medical opioid use among people with OUD receiving treatment with buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone. We utilized a random-effects model employing the restricted maximum likelihood method. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand potential differences between each OUD treatment modality. Results: A total of 10 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. There were 8,367 participants (38% female). The average follow-up time across these studies was 9.7\u2009months (SD\u2009=\u20093.77), ranging from 4 to 15\u2009months. The pharmacotherapies involved were methadone (76.3%) buprenorphine (21.3%), and naltrexone (2.4%). The pooled odds ratio did not indicate that cannabis use significantly influenced non-medical opioid use (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.97\u20131.04, p\u2009=\u2009.98). There is evidence of moderate heterogeneity and publication bias. Conclusion: There was no significant association between cannabis use and non-medical opioid use among patients receiving pharmacotherapies for OUD. These findings neither confirm concerns about cannabis increasing non-medical opioid use during MOUD, nor do they endorse its efficacy in decreasing non-medical opioid use with MOUD. This indicates a need for individualized approaches for cannabis use and challenges the requirement of cannabis abstinence to maintain OUD pharmacotherapies.",

    "title": "A Systematic Review of the Self-Medication Hypothesis in the Context of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Comorbid Problematic Alcohol Use.",
    "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) commonly co-occur and are associated with many negative public health outcomes. There are several etiological models that explain the overlap between PTSD and AUD, including shared genetic risk and phenotypic causality, but the predominant model of etiologic association is the drinking-to-cope self-medication model. Although the self-medication model is conceptually appealing and has been widely accepted within the literature examining alcohol use and anxiety (e.g., PTSD) phenotypes, the findings are inconsistent and there is a lack of rigorous empirical evidence in support of this model. This review, which was, to our knowledge, the first systematic review of the self-medication model in relation to PTSD to date, aimed to synthesize the current literature on the association between PTSD and problematic alcohol use within the context of the self-medication model. In total, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria for the review and assessed the self-medication hypothesis using a variety of measurement instruments and data analytic approaches, such as mediation, moderation, and regression. Overall, the included studies provide evidence for the self-medication hypothesis but are limited in rigor due to methodological limitations. These limitations, which include issues with the operationalization (or lack thereof) of trauma-related drinking to cope, are discussed, and directions for future research are presented.",

    "abstract": "AIMS\nBehavior couples therapy (BCT) is widely considered to be effective in the treatment of substance use disorders. However, the effect size of BCT in different outcome measures, and at different time points requires further study to prove it.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSystematic searches were performed in various databases. Ultimately, we identified 12 studies, involving 19 randomized controlled trials. We used Hedges' g as the effect size, and all pooled analyses were performed using random-effects models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter treatment, BCT was superior to control conditions (either an active or inactive control group) in frequency of substance use (g\u2009=\u20090.17), substance use consequences (g\u2009=\u2009-0.28) and relationship satisfaction (g\u2009=\u20090.45). After a 12-month follow-up, BCT remained superior to control conditions in frequency of substance use (g\u2009=\u20090.32), substance use consequences (g\u2009=\u2009-0.34) and relationship satisfaction (g\u2009=\u20090.31). In addition, BCT was more effective in reducing the frequency of substance use than individual-based treatment (IBT) (g\u2009=\u20090.23). There was no significant relationship between the effect size of BCT and publication year (t\u2009=\u20090.92, P\u2009=\u20090.372), percentage of females (t\u2009=\u2009-0.02, P\u2009=\u20090.987) or the number of treatment sessions (t\u2009=\u2009-0.52, P\u2009=\u20090.609).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBCT was superior to the control conditions in all three outcome measures after treatment and at follow-up, and showed a relatively large effect size for relationship satisfaction. Moreover, BCT was superior to IBT in reducing the frequency of substance use.",

A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature, published from 1900 to 2022, was conducted. Only studies with participants with a mental disorder or a substance use disorder, a structured finance-based intervention or program, a quantitative dependent variable in a behavioral health outcomes domain, and a defined research design were included. Studies were rated with a quality assessment tool, and overall evidence (levels I-VII) for the outcomes was rated. In total, 544 articles were identified, screened for eligibility, and reduced to 55 articles. These articles were rated by two independent raters, and 18 articles were ultimately included. Of these 18 articles, four reported findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one conducted a secondary analysis of an RCT, and the remaining articles were observational studies. The most studied intervention was representative payeeship, which reduced substance use and enhanced money management, showing the strongest evidence for improving outcomes among adults with behavioral health conditions. Weaker evidence suggested that financial education and assistance interventions could improve health care utilization and other psychosocial outcomes among individuals with mental or substance use disorders. Level II-V evidence indicates that finance-based interventions can improve outcomes among adults experiencing behavioral health conditions. Further research is needed to assess the impact of interventions beyond representative payee programs on objectively measured outcomes.",

This review provides estimates for the prevalence of severe mental illness and substance use disorders in incarcerated individuals in LMICs. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched 17 electronic databases to identify prevalence studies of psychiatric disorders in prison populations in LMICs, published between January, 1987, and May, 2018. We included representative studies from general prison samples, providing information about four major psychiatric diagnoses: psychosis, major depression, alcohol use disorders, and drug use disorders. We pooled data from studies using random-effects meta-analyses and assessed the sources of heterogeneity by meta-regression. We extracted general population estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases 2016 database to calculate comparative prevalence ratios. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42015020905. We identified 23 publications reporting prevalence estimates of severe mental illness and substance use disorders for 14\u2008527 prisoners from 13 LMICs. In this population, the estimated pooled 1 year prevalence rates for psychosis were 6\u00b72% (95% CI 4\u00b70-8\u00b76), 16\u00b70% (11\u00b77-20\u00b78) for major depression, 3\u00b78% (1\u00b72-7\u00b76) for alcohol use disorders, and 5\u00b71% (2\u00b79-7\u00b78) for drug use disorders. We noted increased prevalence at prison intake and geographic variations for substance use disorders. For alcohol use disorders, prevalence was higher in the southeast Asian region than in the eastern Mediterranean region; and drug use disorders were more prevalent in the eastern Mediterranean region than in Europe. Prevalence ratios indicated substantially higher rates of severe mental illness and substance use disorders among prisoners than in the general population (the prevalence of non-affective psychosis was on average 16 times higher, major depression and illicit drug use disorder prevalence were both six times higher, and prevalence of alcohol use disorders was double that of the general population). The prevalence of major psychiatric disorders is high in prisoners in LMIC compared with general populations. As these findings are likely to reflect unmet needs, the development of scalable interventions should be a public health priority in resource-poor settings.

We aimed to review morbidity and mortality data on four overlapping populations who experience considerable social exclusion: homeless populations, individuals with substance use disorders, sex workers, and imprisoned individuals. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for studies published between Jan 1, 2005, and Oct 1, 2015. We included only systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies, and observational studies that had morbidity and mortality outcomes, were published in English, from high-income countries, and were done in populations with a history of homelessness, imprisonment, sex work, or substance use disorder (excluding cannabis and alcohol use). Studies with only perinatal outcomes and studies of individuals with a specific health condition or those recruited from intensive care or high dependency hospital units were excluded. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. Primary outcomes were measures of morbidity (prevalence or incidence) and mortality (standardised mortality ratios [SMRs] and mortality rates).

    "abstract": "There are currently over 55\u00a0million refugees and internally displaced persons due to armed conflict. In addition, there are around 150\u00a0million more conflict-affected residents who remain in their home communities. Armed conflict poses a number of potential risks for harmful alcohol use. The objective of the study was to systematically examine evidence on harmful alcohol use among conflict-affected populations in low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review methodology was used following PRISMA guidelines. Quantitative studies were selected with outcomes relating to harmful alcohol use among conflict-affected populations in low- and middle-income countries. Seven bibliographic databases and a range of gray literature sources were searched. Descriptive analysis was applied and a quality assessment conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The search yielded 10,037 references of which 22 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one of the studies used a cross-sectional design, and 1 used a case series design. Evidence on risk factors for harmful alcohol use was weak overall. Factors associated with harmful alcohol use were male gender, older age, cumulative trauma event exposure, and depression. There were no studies on the effectiveness of interventions for harmful alcohol use. The strength of evidence was also limited by the generally moderate quality of the studies. Substantially more evidence is required to understand the scale of conflict-associated harmful alcohol use, key risk factors, association of alcohol use with physical and mental disorders, and effectiveness of interventions to address harmful alcohol use in conflict-affected populations.",

    "title": "Causal Assessment of Income Inequality on Self\u2010Rated Health and All\u2010Cause Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta\u2010Analysis",
    "abstract": "Policy Points Income is thought to impact a broad range of health outcomes. However, whether income inequality (how unequal the distribution of income is in a population) has an additional impact on health is extensively debated. Studies that use multilevel data, which have recently increased in popularity, are necessary to separate the contextual effects of income inequality on health from the effects of individual income on health. Our systematic review found only small associations between income inequality and poor self\u2010rated health and all\u2010cause mortality. The available evidence does not suggest causality, although it remains methodologically flawed and limited, with very few studies using natural experimental approaches or examining income inequality at the national level. Context Whether income inequality has a direct effect on health or is only associated because of the effect of individual income has long been debated. We aimed to understand the association between income inequality and self\u2010rated health (SRH) and all\u2010cause mortality (mortality) and assess if these relationships are likely to be causal. Methods We searched Medline, ISI Web of Science, Embase, and EconLit (PROSPERO: CRD42021252791) for studies considering income inequality and SRH or mortality using multilevel data and adjusting for individual\u2010level socioeconomic position. We calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) for poor SRH and relative risk ratios (RRs) for mortality from random\u2010effects meta\u2010analyses. We critically appraised included studies using the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies \u2013 of Interventions tool. We assessed certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and causality using Bradford Hill (BH) viewpoints. Findings The primary meta\u2010analyses included 2,916,576 participants in 38 cross\u2010sectional studies assessing SRH and 10,727,470 participants in 14 cohort studies of mortality. Per 0.05\u2010unit increase in the Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, the ORs and RRs (95% confidence intervals) for SRH and mortality were 1.06 (1.03\u20101.08) and 1.02 (1.00\u20101.04), respectively. A total of 63.2% of SRH and 50.0% of mortality studies were at serious risk of bias (RoB), resulting in very low and low certainty ratings, respectively. For SRH and mortality, we did not identify relevant evidence to assess the specificity or, for SRH only, the experiment BH viewpoints; evidence for strength of association and dose\u2013response gradient was inconclusive because of the high RoB; we found evidence in support of temporality and plausibility. Conclusions Increased income inequality is only marginally associated with SRH and mortality, but the current evidence base is too methodologically limited to support a causal relationship. To address the gaps we identified, future research should focus on income inequality measured at the national level and addressing confounding with natural experiment approaches.",

Meta-analysis was conducted to pool the study-specific odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Sixty-two studies with 454,643 participants were enrolled. The meta-analysis of proportions revealed that alcohol consumption was not associated with the presence of sarcopenia, with a pooled OR of 0.964 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.912\u20131.019). Further subgroup analysis indicated that alcohol consumption was correlated with lower risk of sarcopenia in men (OR\u2009=\u20090.763; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.622\u20130.938; P\u2009=\u2009.010). The nonlinear dose-response analysis suggested a J-shaped association between alcohol consumption and the risk of sarcopenia, with a nadir at the amounts of alcohol consumption of 6.6 grams/day (OR\u2009=\u20090.765; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.608\u20130.957; P\u2009<\u2009.05). Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis indicate that alcohol consumption is not a risk factor for the development of sarcopenia. Any suggestion of a putative protective effect of alcohol should be treated with caution, particularly in light of the overall lack of relationship reported in the present comprehensive meta-analysis.",

    "title": "Relationship Between Alcohol Consumption and Risky Sexual Behaviors Among Adolescents and Young Adults: A Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Objectives: Adolescents exposed to alcohol have increased risky sexual behaviors (RSBs); however, the association between alcohol consumption and RSBs has to be systematically and quantitatively reviewed. We conducted a meta-analysis of the literature to systematically and quantitatively review the association between alcohol consumption and RSBs in adolescents and young adults. Methods: We searched for qualified articles published from 2000 to 2020 and calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) using the random-effect model. We also conducted meta-regression and sensitivity analyses to identify potential heterogeneity moderators. Results: The meta-analysis of 50 studies involving 465,595 adolescents and young adults indicated that alcohol consumption was significantly associated with early sexual initiation (OR = 1.958, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.635\u20132.346), inconsistent condom use (OR = 1.228, 95% CI = 1.114\u20131.354), and having multiple sexual partners (OR = 1.722, 95% CI = 1.525\u20131.945). Conclusion: Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with RSBs, including early sexual initiation, inconsistent condom use, and multiple sexual partners among adolescents and young adults. To prevent the adverse consequences of alcohol consumption, drinking prevention programs should be initiated at an early age and supported by homes, schools, and communities.",

    "abstract": "Energy usage and disparities in income have emerged as the major threats that hinder the achievement of sustainable development goals in Africa. This study aims to assess the time\u2010varying impact of income inequality on both renewable and nonrenewable energy consumption, utilizing both parametric and nonparametric models across a panel of 18 African countries from 1990 to 2015. We find that, according to the parametric model, income inequality does not affect energy consumption. However, the nonparametric estimates point the presence of both positive and negative relationship between the two variables at different time period. The time varying impacts reveal that unfair income distribution affects renewable energy consumption via the dominance of some channels at specific times. Accordingly, the findings of this study emphasize that policymakers in African countries need to give particular heed to the role played by the income inequality in designing cleaner and greener energy transition policies.",

    "title": "Socioeconomic inequality in lifestyle trajectories among middle-aged and older adults: A 10-year longitudinal analysis across the US, UK and China.",
    "abstract": "Health-related lifestyles may change throughout the life course and are often socially patterned. However, few studies have identified the association of socioeconomic status with the longitudinal patterns of lifestyle trajectories. This study aimed to identify lifestyle trajectories among middle-aged and older adults across multiple regions, and examine whether these trajectories differed by socioeconomic status. In this multi-cohort study, individual-level data were pooled from three longitudinal studies: the Health and Retirement Study in the US, the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing in the UK, and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in China. Lifestyle scores were constructed using smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activities, and sleep quality. Socioeconomic status scores were based on education level and total household income. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify participants' lifestyle trajectories over 10\u00a0years. The associations between socioeconomic status and lifestyle trajectories were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression models. Of the 27,401 participants, 16,325 were from the US, 4683 from the UK, and 6393 from China. Three lifestyle trajectories over 10\u00a0years were identified: 'stable high', 'stable medium', and 'stable low'. Participants with low socioeconomic status were at higher odds of belonging to the 'stable low' group, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.86 (95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.09), 1.38 (95\u00a0% CI 1.12-1.70) and 1.84 (95\u00a0% CI 1.45-2.34) in the US, UK and Chinese participants, respectively. Study-specific meta-analysis showed similar associations between socioeconomic status and lifestyle trajectories, with an OR of 1.69 (low vs high socioeconomic status; 95\u00a0% CI 1.40-2.05) and 1.18 (middle vs high socioeconomic status; 95\u00a0% CI 1.04-1.34). Lifestyle trajectories remained stable over 10\u00a0years, and lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher odds of belonging to the 'stable low' group. Early-life interventions to minimize socioeconomic inequality should be prioritized to promote sustainable healthier lifestyles in later life.",

    "abstract": "That physical, emotional and social problems occur not only to drinkers, but also to others they connect with, is increasingly acknowledged. Financial harms from others' drinking have been seldom studied at the population level, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Whether financial harm and costs from others' drinking inequitably affect women is little known. The study's aim is to compare estimates and correlates of alcohol's financial harm to others than the drinker in 15 countries. Cross-sectional surveys of Alcohol's Harm To Others (AHTO) were conducted in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, India, Ireland, Lao PDR, New Zealand, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the US and Vietnam. 17,670 men and 20,947 women. The prevalence of financial harm in the last year was assessed as financial trouble and/or less money available for household expenses because of someone else's drinking. Meta-analysis and country-level logistic regression of financial harm (vs. none), adjusted for gender, age, education, rurality and participant drinking. Under 3.2 % of respondents in most high-income countries reported financial harm due to others' drinking, whereas 12-22 % did in Thailand, Sri Lanka and India. Financial harm from others' drinking was significantly more common among women than men in nine countries. Among men and women, financial harm was significantly more prevalent in low- and middle- than in high-income countries. Reports of financial harm from others' drinking are more common among women than among men, and in low- and middle-income than in high-income countries.",

We assessed the effectiveness of HBRs on maternal, newborn and child health reporting, care seeking and self-care practice, mortality, morbidity and women's empowerment in low-, middle- and high-income countries. We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Health Systems Evidence, CINAHL, HTA database, NHS EED, and DARE from 1950 to 2017. We also searched the WHO, CDC, ECDC, JICA and UNAIDS. We included randomised controlled trials, prospective controlled trials, and cost-effectiveness studies. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to appraise studies. We extracted and analyzed data for outcomes including maternal, newborn and child health, and women's empowerment. We synthesized and presented data using GRADE Evidence Profiles. We included 14 studies out of 16,419 identified articles. HBRs improved antenatal care and reduced likelihood of pregnancy complications; improved patient-provider communication and enhanced women's feelings of control and empowerment; and improved rates of vaccination among children (OR: 2\u00b739, 95% CI: 1.45-3\u00b792) and mothers (OR 1\u00b798 95% CI:1\u00b729-3\u00b704). A three-year follow-up shows that HBRs reduced risk of cognitive delay in children (p = 0.007). HBRs used during the life cycle of women and children in Indonesia showed benefits for continuity of care. There were no significant effects on healthy pregnancy behaviors such as smoking and consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. There were no statistically significant effects on newborn health outcomes. We did not identify any formal studies on cost or economic evaluation. HBRs show modest but important health effects for women and children. These effects with minimal-to-no harms, multiplied across a population, could play an important role in reducing health inequities in maternal, newborn, and child health.",

    "title": "Changes in blood pressure among users of lay health worker or volunteer operated community-based blood pressure programs over time: a systematic review protocol.",
    "abstract": "The objective of this review is to identify studies reporting on lay health worker- or volunteer-led community-based programs for blood pressure screening and cardiovascular awareness in order to determine if these programs contribute to changes in blood pressure among participants over time.The specific question for this review is: What are the changes in blood pressure among adult users of community-based blood pressure screening and awareness programs operated by lay health workers or volunteers as measured by the differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure between the user's first visit to the program and their last visit to the program? Cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke and heart disease, are quickly becoming global diseases manifesting in countries and communities where they traditionally had not been widespread. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that \"in the Asia/Pacific region, [cardiovascular disease] has become increasingly prevalent in recent decades, and now accounts for about one third of all deaths\". One risk factor that can lead to cardiovascular disease is hypertension. Based on WHO data from 2008, hypertension is now a global problem affecting 27% of the population 25 years of age or older.The risk for cardiovascular disease also appears to be higher among people in urban areas. A recent United Nations population report indicates that in the next 40 years we could see an increase in the world's population by 2.3 billion people. The majority of these people will be residing in urban areas, particularly in developing nations. Between 2011 and 2050, \"the population living in urban areas is projected to gain 2.6 billion, passing from 3.6 billion in 2011 to 6.3 billion in 2050\". Population growth in urban areas is therefore not only projected to include the expected population growth but also expected to include a shift of rural population to urban centers and \"most of the population growth expected in urban areas will be concentrated in the cities and towns of the less developed regions\". This growth of urban areas has the potential to put enormous pressures on health care systems that are already struggling to cope with the rapid increase in diseases thought to be more prevalent in Western societies, such as cardiovascular diseases.Hypertension may be difficult to treat due to a number of factors. Globally, access to antihypertensive medications, hypertension screening, and access to medical care vary from one country to another. Lifestyle factors, such as salt and alcohol consumption, stress, smoking, body weight, and exercise, are risk factors for hypertension that may be influenced by culture, which can in turn support or hinder lifestyle decisions that could significantly affect blood pressure. Hypertension, however, is easy to detect. A trained person with access to a low-cost sphygmomanometer can detect abnormal blood pressures quickly; however, access to trained personnel is not universally guaranteed. Globally - according to one model of skilled health care worker density and total requirement offered for discussion by the Global Health Workforce Alliance and WHO - there could currently be an estimated shortage of over seven million skilled health care workers (midwifes, nurses and physicians), as measured against a theoretical density of skilled health care workers to population. The shortage of skilled health care workers in this model could grow to over 12 million by 2035 if the assumptions of the model and population growth estimates are valid. Through rapid urbanization the potential for inequities in access to healthcare is also increased.Over the last few years, a number of community-based blood pressure screening and education initiatives have been established. These initiatives have been created either as part of research, as part of community outreach programs by publicly funded agencies, or as part of an outreach by not-for-profit organizations with a particular interest in reducing cardiovascular disease in specific hard-to-reach populations. Several systematic reviews have been conducted to assess different models for delivering services to people living with high blood pressure to assess community-based programs with a focus on cardiovascular disease, and to assess effectiveness of community health workers (CHW) in a variety of settings. These systematic reviews point to the importance of distinguishing between different categories of health care providers, their training and their roles in program delivery when assessing studies for possible inclusion in a systematic review.In a systematic review of studies from the US by Brownstein et al. focusing on the effectiveness of community health workers (CHWs) in the care of people with hypertension, this category of health care providers went under many different names. Community health workers in this review were defined as \"any health workers who carried out functions related to health care deliver, were trained as part of an intervention, had no formal paraprofessional or professional designation, and had a relationship with the community being served\". One of the findings from this review was the wide variety of formal training of the CHWs. In other parts of the world, a CHW might be defined differently. In their review of CHW-based programs focusing on children's health, Bhattacharyya, Winch, LeBan and Tien found that \"in general CHWs are not paid salaries because the MOH (Ministry of Health) or donors do not consider salaries to be sustainable. Yet CHWs are often held accountable and supervised as if they were employees. Community health worker programs must recognize that CHWs are volunteers (emphasis in original), even if they receive small monetary or nonmonetary incentives. They are volunteering their time to serve the community\". One Canadian model for delivering a cardiovascular awareness program designed to reach older adults through their primary care provider is based on volunteers with basic training to perform blood pressure measurements and cardiovascular health information.In a global review of a wide range of public health and health promotion initiatives operated by lay health workers from 2005, Lewin et al. identified over 40 different names or terms for a lay health worker. However, the definition of a lay health worker used by Lewin et al. is very similar to the definition of CHWs offered by Brownstein et al. Lewin et al.'s systematic review was the only study with a global focus that was located that reviewed studies of programs with a cardiovascular component using lay health workers. In this study, the sample size of studies focusing on lay health workers and cardiovascular disease was small (N=3) and the results from two of the studies were inconclusive to the point where the authors felt they could not pool the results.While a lay health worker may or may not receive some compensation for their work, volunteers in higher income areas of the world such as in North America typically do not receive any compensation. Volunteers, as observed by Bhattacharyya et al., are common in many parts of the world, and in some areas they provide delivery of programs and services that reach hundreds of thousands of individuals. One challenge for this systematic review will therefore be to isolate those programs that are delivered by lay health workers or volunteers who receive little or no compensation and programs where staff is paid. The importance of this distinction is on one hand related to cost - as observed by Bhattacharyya et al., many organizations responsible for delivery of community-based programs do not have funding for salaried staff. On the other hand there might be other factors in the relationship between a community being served by a program and the staff delivering the program. One such factor could be linked to the role of the person delivering the program as either a paid health care professional or an unpaid lay health worker or volunteer.Through this proposed JBI systematic review, the reviewers will focus on community-based blood pressure screening and health information programs delivered by either lay health workers or volunteers. Previous systematic reviews have indicated that programs focusing on blood pressure reduction delivered in a variety of settings and delivered by a variety of health care professionals might lower blood pressure among program participants over time. This systematic review will be limited to community-based programs rather than hospital or research facility-based programs, and to programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers rather than programs delivered by paid community health workers, nurses or teams of health care providers under direction of a primary care provider. Compared to other recent systematic reviews which focused on studies with comparison groups and included few studies where lay health workers were involved, this systematic review will attempt to fill this gap in knowledge about programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers by focusing on non-randomized controlled studies which report blood pressure changes over time in programs targeting the general population. Community-based programs might have a variety of designs with a number of different interventions, and where possible these designs and interventions will be identified and subgroup analysis conducted as appropriate. It is hoped that this systematic review can extend the work by Lewin et al. by identifying additional studies globally, focusing on programs delivered by lay health workers or volunteers but limited to studies reporting changes in blood pressure over time. Where possible, a meta-analysis of the changes in blood pressure over time among participants in these programs will be conducted. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: A growing body of evidence highlights the role of the intestine in the development of various alcohol use disorder (AUD) complications. The intestinal microbiome has been proposed as an essential factor in mediating the development of AUD complications such as alcoholic liver disease. Objectives: To provide a comprehensive description of alcohol-induced intestinal microbiome alterations. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the effect of alcohol on the intestinal microbiome using the PRISMA checklist. We searched the Medline database on the PubMed platform for studies determining the effect of alcohol on microbiota in individuals with AUD. The manual search included references of retrieved articles. Only human studies examining the intestinal bacterial microbiome using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were included. Data comparing relative abundances of bacteria comprising intestinal microbiota was extracted. Results: We retrieved 17 studies investigating intestinal microbiome alterations in individuals with AUD. Intestinal microbiome alterations in individuals with AUD included depletion of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and an increase of Enterobacteriaceae. At the phylum level, a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and lower of Bacteroidetes were found. Mixed results regarding Bifidobacterium were obtained. Several species of short-chain fatty acids producing bacteria had a lower abundance in individuals with alcohol use disorder. Conclusion: Intestinal microbiome alterations associated with dysbiosis in individuals with AUD are generally consistent across studies, making it a promising target in potential AUD complications treatment.",

    "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder and Dementia: A Review",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE By 2040, 21.6% of Americans will be over age 65, and the population of those older than age 85 is estimated to reach 14.4 million. Although not causative, older age is a risk factor for dementia: every 5 years beyond age 65, the risk doubles; approximately one-third of those older than age 85 are diagnosed with dementia. As current alcohol consumption among older adults is significantly higher compared to previous generations, a pressing question is whether drinking alcohol increases the risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other forms of dementia. SEARCH METHODS Databases explored included PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. To accomplish this narrative review on the effects of alcohol consumption on dementia risk, the literature covered included clinical diagnoses, epidemiology, neuropsychology, postmortem pathology, neuroimaging and other biomarkers, and translational studies. Searches conducted between January 12 and August 1, 2023, included the following terms and combinations: \u201caging,\u201d \u201calcoholism,\u201d \u201calcohol use disorder (AUD),\u201d \u201cbrain,\u201d \u201cCNS,\u201d \u201cdementia,\u201d \u201cWernicke,\u201d \u201cKorsakoff,\u201d \u201cAlzheimer,\u201d \u201cvascular,\u201d \u201cfrontotemporal,\u201d \u201cLewy body,\u201d \u201cclinical,\u201d \u201cdiagnosis,\u201d \u201cepidemiology,\u201d \u201cpathology,\u201d \u201cautopsy,\u201d \u201cpostmortem,\u201d \u201chistology,\u201d \u201ccognitive,\u201d \u201cmotor,\u201d \u201cneuropsychological,\u201d \u201cmagnetic resonance,\u201d \u201cimaging,\u201d \u201cPET,\u201d \u201cligand,\u201d \u201cdegeneration,\u201d \u201catrophy,\u201d \u201ctranslational,\u201d \u201crodent,\u201d \u201crat,\u201d \u201cmouse,\u201d \u201cmodel,\u201d \u201camyloid,\u201d \u201cneurofibrillary tangles,\u201d \u201c\u03b1-synuclein,\u201d or \u201cpresenilin.\u201d When relevant, \u201cspecies\u201d (i.e., \u201chumans\u201d or \u201cother animals\u201d) was selected as an additional filter. Review articles were avoided when possible. SEARCH RESULTS The two terms \u201calcoholism\u201d and \u201caging\u201d retrieved about 1,350 papers; adding phrases\u2014for example, \u201cpostmortem\u201d or \u201cmagnetic resonance\u201d\u2014limited the number to fewer than 100 papers. Using the traditional term, \u201calcoholism\u201d with \u201cdementia\u201d resulted in 876 citations, but using the currently accepted term \u201calcohol use disorder (AUD)\u201d with \u201cdementia\u201d produced only 87 papers. Similarly, whereas the terms \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s\u201d and \u201calcoholism\u201d yielded 318 results, \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s\u201d and \u201calcohol use disorder (AUD)\u201d returned only 40 citations. As pertinent postmortem pathology papers were published in the 1950s and recent animal models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease were created in the early 2000s, articles referenced span the years 1957 to 2024. In total, more than 5,000 articles were considered; about 400 are herein referenced. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Chronic alcohol misuse accelerates brain aging and contributes to cognitive impairments, including those in the mnemonic domain. The consensus among studies from multiple disciplines, however, is that alcohol misuse can increase the risk for dementia, but not necessarily Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Key issues to consider include the reversibility of brain damage following abstinence from chronic alcohol misuse compared to the degenerative and progressive course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and the characteristic presence of protein inclusions in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which are absent in the brains of those with AUD.",

    "title": "Opioid agonist therapy for opioid use disorder in primary versus specialty care.",
    "abstract": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is commonly treated in specialized care settings with long-acting opioid agonists, also known as opioid agonist therapy, or OAT. Despite the rise in opioid use globally and evidence for a 50% reduction in mortality when OAT is employed, the proportion of people with OUD receiving OAT remains small. One initiative to improve the access and uptake of OAT could be to offer OAT in a primary care setting; primary care clinics are more numerous, might reduce the visibility and potential stigma of receiving treatment for OUD, and may facilitate the care of other medical conditions that are unrelated to OUD. However, it is unknown how effective treating OUD in primary care would be. To assess the benefits and harms of using opioid agonist therapy (OAT) to treat people with opioid use disorder (OUD) in a primary care setting, as compared to a traditional specialty care setting. We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and two trials registers in March 2025. We did not restrict searches by language or publication date. Eligible studies were parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-randomized trials comparing OAT for OUD treatment in primary care versus specialty care settings. Participants were community-dwelling adults with OUD, as identified and defined by trial-specific inclusion criteria. We excluded trials if they included only pregnant women, or those who were incarcerated, but accepted all other comorbidity requirements (e.g. being HIV positive). Primary outcomes included treatment retention, abstinence from non-prescribed opioids, major adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes were other patient-oriented outcomes, including quality of life, patient satisfaction, all-cause mortality, opioid-related mortality, all-cause hospitalization or emergency room visit, all-cause incarceration, and minor adverse events. Two review authors independently extracted data using a predesigned RCT template in Covidence. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We analyzed outcomes using Review Manager and a random-effects model to account for variability in care models and populations. We included seven RCTs involving 1992 participants. The studies were completed in France (1 study), Ukraine (1 study), and the US (5 studies), and enrolled predominantly males (75%) with a mean age of 38 years. Risk of bias in individual trials was typically low or unclear in all domains except for blinding, where it was high, given participants and providers could not realistically be blinded to setting. One trial was at high risk of bias related to random sequence generation and another for incomplete outcome data. The evidence is very uncertain whether there was a difference in treatment retention in a primary care setting (risk ratio (RR) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.34; 7 studies, 1952 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Abstinence from non-prescribed opioids at the end of follow-up may have been higher in participants managed in primary care (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.46; 5 studies, 428 participants; low-certainty evidence). Major adverse events were infrequently reported. Only one trial reported all-cause death (one in primary care versus four in specialty care), but these numbers were too small to be meaningful (very low-certainty evidence). Although data from three studies regarding patient satisfaction could not be combined, patients in primary care may have had greater satisfaction. We downgraded certainty in the evidence twice for indirectness for all outcomes given the studies excluded high-risk patients (e.g. those who were pregnant, had co-dependence on alcohol or benzodiazepines, had psychiatric illness, or were homeless) and primary care providers were often atypical of primary care in general (with connections to, or proximity with, OUD-specialized clinics). We downgraded treatment retention an additional level for inconsistency due to high heterogeneity (I For lower-risk people with OUD who were stable on OAT, managing their OAT in primary care, as compared to specialty care, the evidence is very uncertain for treatment retention and may have resulted in better abstinence from non-prescribed opioids and better patient satisfaction. Further trials in primary care clinics that have less experience with, or connection to, OUD specialty clinics is warranted.",

    "title": "Prevalence of Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders Among Adolescents Experiencing Homelessness: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Adolescents with existing mental health and substance use disorders are at higher risk for homelessness, and being homeless can further exacerbate these issues. However, no systematic review has specifically assessed the prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders among homeless adolescents using validated diagnostic measures. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders among adolescents experiencing homelessness, based on studies employing validated diagnostic measures. A systematic search was conducted across electronic databases, including AMED, Cochrane, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed, from inception through February 3, 2024. Studies were included if they assessed the prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders using validated diagnostic measures in adolescents aged 12-17\u00a0years who were experiencing homelessness. Data extraction was performed using Covidence and reviewed for accuracy by two independent reviewers. Weighted average prevalence rates for mental health and substance use disorders among homeless adolescents were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Out of 7,729 citations, 116 studies were reviewed in full, and two studies met all criteria (N\u2009=\u2009226). The most common mental health disorder identified, based on diagnostic classifications used in earlier versions of the DSM and ICD, was drug abuse disorder (43%, 95% CI [34, 53]), followed by disruptive behavior disorder (39%, 95% CI [25, 53]) and alcohol abuse disorder (38%, 95% CI [28, 48]). This systematic review highlights the limited evidence available on the prevalence of mental health and substance use disorders among homeless adolescents from studies using validated diagnostic measures. Further research is essential to enhance understanding and to develop data-driven intervention strategies to better address the needs and challenges faced by this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases can spread rapidly in the globalized world, and the complex intersection of individual, social, economic, and cultural factors make it difficult to identify vulnerabilities in the face of pandemics. Therefore, this study aimed to identify vulnerability factors to infection and worse outcomes associated with COVID-19. This is a scoping review study of six databases that selected publications between 2019 and 2023, focusing on individual, social, and programmatic dimensions of vulnerability. The results were recorded in a spreadsheet and analyzed, considering the interrelationships among these dimensions. A total of 45 articles were included in the review. Content analysis was conducted using the theoretical framework of health vulnerability, which divides vulnerability into individual, social, and programmatic dimensions. Race/ethnicity, homelessness, incarceration, socioeconomic level, food insecurity, and remote areas were classified as social dimensions. On the other hand, cancer, cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS, alcoholism, advanced age, obesity, mental disorders, diabetes, kidney disease, and pregnancy were classified as individual dimensions. None of the publications found explicitly mentioned programmatic vulnerabilities. The research found that social vulnerabilities reinforce individual vulnerabilities, creating a vicious cycle. In addition, programmatic vulnerabilities reinforce this relationship. This study emphasizes that public policies should address these different dimensions of vulnerability. It suggests that this information should be incorporated into health surveillance and future decision-making to face new pandemics. https://archive.org/details/osf-registrations-wgfmj-v1.",

    "abstract": "Frequent presenters (FPs) are a group of individuals who visit the hospital emergency department (ED) frequently for urgent care. Many among the group present with the main diagnosis of mental health conditions. This group of individual tend to use ED resources disproportionally and significantly affects overall healthcare outcomes.

Covidence was used to perform extraction and screening, which were completed independently by two authors. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. The abstracts of 3341 non-duplicate articles were screened, with 40 full texts assessed for eligibility. 20 studies were included from 2004 to 2022 conducted in 6 countries with a total patient number of 25,688 (52% male, 48% female, mean age 40.7\u00a0years old). 27% were unemployed, 20% married, 41% homeless, and 17% had tertiary or above education. 44% had a history of substance abuse or alcohol dependence. The top 3 diagnoses are found to be anxiety disorders (44%), depressive disorders (39%) schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (33%). On average, FPs are middle-aged and equally prevalent in both genders. Current data lacks representation for gender-diverse groups. They are significantly associated with high rates of unemployment, homelessness, lower than average education level, and being single. Anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders are the most common clinical diagnoses associated with the group.",

    "abstract": "In the Indian setting, communal riots characterized by intergroup violence have been common and have had an impact on the lives of both people and communities. The goal of this systematic review is to investigate the psychological effects of Indian communal riots in depth. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, the study aims to identify recurring themes, patterns, and variances in the psychological effects encountered by victims of community violence. The researcher searched Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO for research published between the year 2000 and the year 2022 in each of these databases. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was employed to evaluate the study's quality. After identifying 1189 publications in all, 195 of them were chosen for full-text examination, and 41 research were ultimately included. Twenty studies examined depression and mental health with a prevalence rate of 49%. Five studies (12%) examined post-traumatic stress disorder. In places devastated by riots, the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder varied from 4% to 41%. Other studies investigated anxiety, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. However, two studies revealed that group activities could lower depression and suicide rates, perhaps as a result of increased social cohesiveness and group catharsis among subpopulations. The researcher investigated the connection between collective activities and mental health in this systematic review, providing strong evidence that riots, protests, and other collective actions-even peaceful ones-can harm mental health outcomes. Thus, healthcare providers must be aware of the psychological and emotional effects of riots, revolutions, and demonstrations. It is essential to do more study on this newly identified sociopolitical driver of mental health.",

Four other studies found in references of these articles were also included in the review. Albeit the use of different criteria to define the RD phenomenon, it is more likely to be associated with patients who are younger, single, with low educational level, unemployed, diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, particularly schizophrenia, and with alcohol and/or substance use. It is also associated with a younger age on disease onset, suicidality, noncompliance and voluntary type of admission. Recognizing patients with a RD pattern of admissions and prediction of rehospitalization can help the development of preventive intervention strategies and identify potential limitations in existing health care delivery systems.",

    "abstract": "Patients with substance use disorder (SUD) usually report lower quality of life (QoL) than other patients and as much as patients with other mental disorders. The present study investigated variables associated with QoL domains among patients with SUD. Studies in English published before December 1 After the assessment of over 10,230 papers, a total of 17 studies met the eligibility criteria. Five studies (1260 participants) found that patients with SUD who were older were less likely to have a good physical Qol (OR\u2009=\u20090.86, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.78, 0.95). Two studies (1171 participants) indicated that patients with SUD who were homeless were less likely to have a good environmental Qol (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.47, p\u2009=\u20090.003). However, a better mental QoL was observed in four studies (1126 participants) among those receiving support from their family or friends (social networks) (OR\u2009=\u20091.05, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.04, 1.07). Two studies (588 participants) showed that those using cocaine were less likely to have a good mental QoL (OR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.75, 0.93). Two studies (22,534 participants) showed that those using alcohol were less likely to have a good physical QoL (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-2.21, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Two studies (956 participants) showed that those having severe substance use disorders were less likely to have a good mental (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-5.44, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and environmental (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.59, p\u2009=\u20090.006) QoL respectively. Four studies (3515 participants) showed that those having mental disorders were less likely to have a good physical QoL (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-1.05, p\u2009=\u20090.001), and another three studies (1211 participants) that those having mental disorders were less likely to have a good mental QoL (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009-0.33, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, two studies (609 and 682 participants) showed that individuals who experienced trauma symptoms or mental disorders were less likely to have good social and environmental QoL, respectively (OR\u2009=\u20090.78, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.61, 1.00) and (OR\u2009=\u20090.92, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.9, 0.94). The findings suggest the need for mental health services to improve the QOL among patients with SUD but further study is needed. Cocaine may cause behavioral changes which can increase the possibility of reckless and suicidal behaviors. Therefore, identifying cocaine user access, adherence, and satisfaction with treatment is recommended as an important component of adaptive functioning. Interventions that help patients with SUD get support from people within their social networks who support their recovery are also essential to their QoL.",

Many primary studies have estimated prevalence rates for mental disorders in homeless individuals. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the prevalence of any mental disorder and major psychiatric diagnoses in clearly defined homeless populations in any high-income country. We systematically searched for observational studies that estimated prevalence rates of mental disorders in samples of homeless individuals, using Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar. We updated a previous systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2007, and searched until 1 April 2021. Studies were included if they sampled exclusively homeless persons, diagnosed mental disorders by standardized criteria using validated methods, provided point or up to 12-month prevalence rates, and were conducted in high-income countries. We identified 39 publications with a total of 8,049 participants. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for prevalence studies and a risk of bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses of prevalence rates were conducted, and heterogeneity was assessed by meta-regression analyses. The mean prevalence of any current mental disorder was estimated at 76.2% (95% CI 64.0% to 86.6%). The most common diagnostic categories were alcohol use disorders, at 36.7% (95% CI 27.7% to 46.2%), and drug use disorders, at 21.7% (95% CI 13.1% to 31.7%), followed by schizophrenia spectrum disorders (12.4% [95% CI 9.5% to 15.7%]) and major depression (12.6% [95% CI 8.0% to 18.2%]). We found substantial heterogeneity in prevalence rates between studies, which was partially explained by sampling method, study location, and the sex distribution of participants. Limitations included lack of information on certain subpopulations (e.g., women and immigrants) and unmet healthcare needs. Public health and policy interventions to improve the health of homeless persons should consider the pattern and extent of psychiatric morbidity. Our findings suggest that the burden of psychiatric morbidity in homeless persons is substantial, and should lead to regular reviews of how healthcare services assess, treat, and follow up homeless people. The high burden of substance use disorders and schizophrenia spectrum disorders need particular attention in service development.

Les \u00e9tudes consacr\u00e9es aux interventions effectu\u00e9es par des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 mentale, des membres du corps m\u00e9dical ou des agents de sant\u00e9 communautaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cart\u00e9es, car les pays observ\u00e9s manquent de personnel dans ce domaine. D'autres donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9lev\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s des auteurs d'\u00e9tudes. Les premiers r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient des mesures relatives aux troubles de stress post-traumatique, \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression, \u00e0 l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 la consommation d'alcool. Nous avons employ\u00e9 un mod\u00e8le de m\u00e9ta-analyse \u00e0 effets al\u00e9atoires pour \u00e9valuer les retomb\u00e9es.R\u00e9sultats Nous avons identifi\u00e9 1072 \u00e9tudes; 19 d'entre elles (impliquant 20 essais et 5612 participants au total) correspondaient aux crit\u00e8res d'inclusion. Le g de Hedges pour la taille de l'effet cumul\u00e9 des interventions g\u00e9r\u00e9es par des conseillers non professionnels sp\u00e9cialement form\u00e9s, compar\u00e9 la plupart du temps avec l'absence d'intervention ou les soins habituels, s'\u00e9levait \u00e0 \u22120,616 (intervalle de confiance de 95%: \u22120,866 \u00e0 \u22120,366). Ce r\u00e9sultat t\u00e9moigne d'un effet non n\u00e9gligeable, de taille moyenne. Il n'existait aucune preuve indiquant un biais de publication ou toute autre forme de biais dans les \u00e9tudes, et les r\u00e9sultats ne laissaient transpara\u00eetre aucune valeur extr\u00eame atypique.Conclusion Le recours \u00e0 des conseillers non professionnels sp\u00e9cialement form\u00e9s pour effectuer des interventions de sant\u00e9 mentale dans les pays \u00e0 faibles et moyens revenus a entra\u00een\u00e9 une am\u00e9lioration significative des sympt\u00f4mes dans de nombreuses situations. Investigar la eficacia de las intervenciones de salud mental basadas en la comunidad y llevadas a cabo por asesores no especializados con formaci\u00f3n profesional en pa\u00edses con ingresos bajos y medios. Se realizaron b\u00fasquedas en las bases de datos PubMed\u00ae, el Registro Cochrane Central de Ensayos Controlados (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), PROSPERO y EBSCO y en las publicaciones de la secci\u00f3n profesional del National Center para TEPT de los Estados Unidos para obtener ensayos controlados aleatorios de intervenciones de salud mental realizadas por consejeros legos con formaci\u00f3n profesional en pa\u00edses con ingresos bajos y medios, publicados entre 2000 y 2019. Se excluyeron los estudios de intervenciones realizadas por trabajadores profesionales de la salud mental, profesionales m\u00e9dicos o trabajadores de la salud de la comunidad porque hay escasez de este personal en los pa\u00edses de estudio. Se obtuvieron datos adicionales de los autores de los estudios. Los resultados primarios fueron medidas de trastorno de estr\u00e9s postraum\u00e1tico, depresi\u00f3n, ansiedad y consumo de alcohol. Para estimar el tama\u00f1o del efecto, se utiliz\u00f3 un modelo de metan\u00e1lisis de efectos aleatorios. Se identificaron 1072 estudios, de los cuales 19 (con 20 ensayos y 5612 participantes en total) cumplieron los criterios de inclusi\u00f3n. El  El uso de asesores no especializados con formaci\u00f3n profesional para realizar intervenciones de salud mental en pa\u00edses con ingresos bajos y medios se asoci\u00f3 con mejoras

    "abstract": "We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing community-based assessment and treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease, injecting drug use (IDU) and alcohol use amongst people who are homeless (PWAH). Using systematic review methodology, databases were searched (MEDLINE/EMBASE/CINAHL) for studies combining PWAH, HCV-related liver disease and community assessment until December 2019. Studies with a sample size \u2265 30, with PWAH constituting at least 30% of the cohort were included and a quality assessment performed. Pooled estimates of key indicators were analysed using meta-analysis. We identified 39 studies (n\u00a0=\u00a013,918), 37 categorised as poor quality (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). Prevalence of homelessness ranged between 30%-100% (37 studies). Eight studies provided all of the following: HCV screening, alcohol/substance use/liver fibrosis assessment and HCV treatment. No study provided interventions for alcohol use, with two providing opioid substitution treatment. Alcohol use prevalence (24 studies) was 4%-97%, being 59% (95% CI 20%-92%) in four studies that included only PWAH. Recent IDU prevalence (16 studies) was 7%-73%, being 21% (95% CI 17%-26%) in four studies that included only PWAH. HCV seroprevalence (25 studies) was 2.5% - 58%; in 13 studies that included only PWAH, this was 20% (95% CI 12%-30%). Prevalence of F4 fibrosis (nine studies) was 6%-28%, being 7% and 16% in two studies that included only PWAH. Direct acting antiviral-based intention-to-treat sustained virological response (SVR) rates (five studies) were 82%-92%, being 92% in the one study that included only PWAH. In the only two randomised controlled trials (RCT) identified, community-based interventions (mental health/peer mentor) significantly increased linkage to care (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), HCV treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and SVR rates (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). The burden from alcohol/IDU and HCV, and consequently liver disease in PWAH needs addressing. RCT trials assessing community-based interventions to improve liver health in PWAH are needed.",

    "title": "Recovery housing for substance use disorder: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Recovery housing, an abstinence-based living environment, is the most widely available form of substance use disorder (SUD) recovery support infrastructure. This systematic review characterized the randomized control trials (RCT) and quasi-experimental designs (QED) research on recovery housing. We conducted a search across PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and CENTRAL published prior to February 2024. For inclusion, studies had to compare recovery housing alone to a non-recovery housing condition. Our search identified 5 eligible studies including 3 RCTs and 2 QEDs, across 11 reports. Participants Ns ranged from 150 to 470 and follow-up durations were 6\u201324\u202fmonths. Recovery housing interventions performed better than continuing care as usual/no intervention on abstinence, income, employment, criminal charges and to a lesser extent incarceration. Recovery housing also performed better than comparative interventions delivered in other types of residential settings (e.g., therapeutic communities) on increasing alcohol abstinence and reducing days of substance use, while also increasing income and employment rates. An exception was in study samples that had high percentages of formerly incarcerated women (90% or more) where reduced substance use was the only benefit of recovery housing when compared to other types of residential interventions and was inconsistent when compared to continuing care as usual/no intervention. Moreover, recovery housing demonstrated higher cost effectiveness than continuing care as usual/no intervention and comparative interventions. Based on quantity, quality, and support for the service, the existing level of evidence for recovery housing is considered moderate. Expanding access to recovery housing may enhance outcomes for individuals with SUD, in general, while producing cost saving benefits, but given the small number of high quality studies additional comparative trials are needed. Also, future research should identify specific sub-groups who may or may not benefit from recovery housing interventions and why, so as to develop and test suitably augmented housing models or identify helpful alternatives.",

    "title": "Extended-release pharmacotherapies for substance use disorders in incarcerated populations: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Substance use (SU) is prevalent among individuals in the criminal justice system (CJS). However, there is often poor access to treatment. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of two medications, extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP) for the prison population. We searched Scopus, OVID/Embase, PubMed/Medline, ProQuest, EBSCO, Cochrane Library and Australian Criminology Database for original articles published from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2022. 18+, substance use disorder; XR treatment; recent incarceration. We extracted study, participants, treatment characteristics and outcome variables. We conducted risk of bias assessments using the RoB-2, ROBINS-I, JBI tools and Evers et al. RESULTS: We identified 25 papers (16 studies) examining 3403 participants. Sixteen papers (9 studies) focused on XR-NTX, eight (7 studies) on XR-BUP and one on both. Eighteen papers (11 studies) were from the US, with the remainder from Norway, Australia, UK, Canada and Germany. There were eight RCTs (10 papers), four secondary observational analyses, four cohort studies, four economic analyses, two case series and one qualitative paper. Most studies had small-moderate samples, with varying retention and follow-up periods. Among RCTs, two XR-NTX studies for opioid use found no difference in retention vs treatment as usual and placebo, while one reported improved retention for XR-NTX implant vs methadone. One RCT showed mixed retention results for XR-NTX vs placebo in alcohol use. One XR-BUP study showed improved or equivalent treatment retention (depending on measures) vs sublingual buprenorphine. There was no difference in overdoses. SU for XR-NTX was challenging to assess due to differing definitions, measures and comparators. XR-BUP yielded mixed SU results, with one indicating a greater effect and another no difference from comparators. There is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of extended release naltrexone and buprenorphine among individuals in the criminal justice system compared with shorter acting formulations. But there is growing evidence for the effectiveness of extended release buprenorphine in reducing opioid use and improving treatment retention in that population, with potential cost offsets from initial medication expenses.",

    "title": "Mental and physical health morbidity among people in prisons: an umbrella review.",
    "abstract": "People who experience incarceration are characterised by poor health profiles. Clarification of the disease burden in the prison population can inform service and policy development. We aimed to synthesise and assess the evidence regarding the epidemiology of mental and physical health conditions among people in prisons worldwide. In this umbrella review, five bibliographic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Global Health) were systematically searched from inception to identify meta-analyses published up to Oct 31, 2023, which examined the prevalence or incidence of mental and physical health conditions in general prison populations. We excluded meta-analyses that examined health conditions in selected or clinical prison populations. Prevalence data were extracted from published reports and study authors were contacted for additional information. Estimates were synthesised and stratified by sex, age, and country income level. The robustness of the findings was assessed in terms of heterogeneity, excess significance bias, small-study effects, and review quality. The study protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023404827. Our search of the literature yielded 1909 records eligible for screening. 1736 articles were excluded and 173 full-text reports were examined for eligibility. 144 articles were then excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria, which resulted in 29 meta-analyses eligible for inclusion. 12 of these were further excluded because they examined the same health condition. We included data from 17 meta-analyses published between 2002 and 2023. In adult men and women combined, the 6-month prevalence was 11\u00b74% (95% CI 9\u00b79-12\u00b78) for major depression, 9\u00b78% (6\u00b78-13\u00b72) for post-traumatic stress disorder, and 3\u00b77% (3\u00b72-4\u00b71) for psychotic illness. On arrival to prison, 23\u00b78% (95% CI 21\u00b70-26\u00b77) of people met diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder and 38\u00b79% (31\u00b75-46\u00b72) for drug use disorder. Half of those with major depression or psychotic illness had a comorbid substance use disorder. Infectious diseases were also common; 17\u00b77% (95% CI 15\u00b70-20\u00b77) of people were antibody-positive for hepatitis C virus, with lower estimates (ranging between 2\u00b76% and 5\u00b72%) found for hepatitis B virus, HIV, and tuberculosis. Meta-regression analyses indicated significant differences in prevalence by sex and country income level, albeit not consistent across health conditions. The burden of non-communicable chronic diseases was only examined in adults aged 50 years and older. Overall, the quality of the evidence was limited by high heterogeneity and small-study effects. People in prisons have a specific pattern of morbidity that represents an opportunity for public health to address. In particular, integrating prison health within the national public health system, adequately resourcing primary care and mental health services, and improving linkage with post-release health services could affect public health and safety. Population-based longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the extent to which incarceration affects health. Research Foundation-Flanders, Wellcome Trust, National Institutes of Health.",

    "title": "Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs for alcohol use disorder.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) confers a prodigious burden of disease, disability, premature mortality, and high economic costs from lost productivity, accidents, violence, incarceration, and increased healthcare utilization. For over 80 years, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has been a widespread AUD recovery organization, with millions of members and treatment free at the point of access, but it is only recently that rigorous research on its effectiveness has been conducted. To evaluate whether peer-led AA and professionally-delivered treatments that facilitate AA involvement (Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) interventions) achieve important outcomes, specifically: abstinence, reduced drinking intensity, reduced alcohol-related consequences, alcohol addiction severity, and healthcare cost offsets. We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO from inception to 2 August 2019. We searched for ongoing and unpublished studies via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 15 November 2018. All searches included non-English language literature. We handsearched references of topic-related systematic reviews and bibliographies of included studies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-randomized studies that compared AA or TSF (AA/TSF) with other interventions, such as motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), TSF treatment variants, or no treatment. We also included healthcare cost offset studies. Participants were non-coerced adults with AUD. We categorized studies by: study design (RCT/quasi-RCT; non-randomized; economic); degree of standardized manualization (all interventions manualized versus some/none); and comparison intervention type (i.e. whether AA/TSF was compared to an intervention with a different theoretical orientation or an AA/TSF intervention that varied in style or intensity). For analyses, we followed Cochrane methodology calculating the standard mean difference (SMD) for continuous variables (e.g. percent days abstinent (PDA)) or the relative risk (risk ratios (RRs)) for dichotomous variables. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to pool effects wherever possible. We included 27 studies containing 10,565 participants (21 RCTs/quasi-RCTs, 5 non-randomized, and 1 purely economic study). The average age of participants within studies ranged from 34.2 to 51.0 years. AA/TSF was compared with psychological clinical interventions, such as MET and CBT, and other 12-step program variants. We rated selection bias as being at high risk in 11 of the 27 included studies, unclear in three, and as low risk in 13. We rated risk of attrition bias as high risk in nine studies, unclear in 14, and low in four, due to moderate (> 20%) attrition rates in the study overall (8 studies), or in study treatment group (1 study). Risk of bias due to inadequate researcher blinding was high in one study, unclear in 22, and low in four. Risks of bias arising from the remaining domains were predominantly low or unclear. AA/TSF (manualized) compared to treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) RCTs comparing manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions (e.g. CBT), showed AA/TSF improves rates of continuous abstinence at 12 months (risk ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.42; 2 studies, 1936 participants; high-certainty evidence). This effect remained consistent at both 24 and 36 months. For percentage days abstinent (PDA), AA/TSF appears to perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months (mean difference (MD) 3.03, 95% CI -4.36 to 10.43; 4 studies, 1999 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and better at 24 months (MD 12.91, 95% CI 7.55 to 18.29; 2 studies, 302 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 36 months (MD 6.64, 95% CI 1.54 to 11.75; 1 study, 806 participants; low-certainty evidence). For longest period of abstinence (LPA), AA/TSF may perform as well as comparison interventions at six months (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.30 to 1.50; 2 studies, 136 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months, as measured by drinks per drinking day (DDD) (MD -0.17, 95% CI -1.11 to 0.77; 1 study, 1516 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and percentage days heavy drinking (PDHD) (MD -5.51, 95% CI -14.15 to 3.13; 1 study, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence). For alcohol-related consequences, AA/TSF probably performs as well as other clinical interventions at 12 months (MD -2.88, 95% CI -6.81 to 1.04; 3 studies, 1762 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For alcohol addiction severity, one study found evidence of a difference in favor of AA/TSF at 12 months (P < 0.05; low-certainty evidence). AA/TSF (non-manualized) compared to treatments with a different theoretical orientation (e.g. CBT) (randomized/quasi-randomized evidence) For the proportion of participants completely abstinent, non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at three to nine months follow-up (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.18; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). Non-manualized AA/TSF may also perform slightly better than other clinical interventions for PDA (MD 3.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.69; 1 study, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). For drinking intensity, AA/TSF may perform as well as other clinical interventions at nine months, as measured by DDD (MD -1.76, 95% CI -2.23 to -1.29; 1 study, 93 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and PDHD (MD 2.09, 95% CI -1.24 to 5.42; 1 study, 286 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the RCTs comparing non-manualized AA/TSF to other clinical interventions assessed LPA, alcohol-related consequences, or alcohol addiction severity. Cost-effectiveness studies In three studies, AA/TSF had higher healthcare cost savings than outpatient treatment, CBT, and no AA/TSF treatment. The fourth study found that total medical care costs decreased for participants attending CBT, MET, and AA/TSF treatment, but that among participants with worse prognostic characteristics AA/TSF had higher potential cost savings than MET (moderate-certainty evidence). There is high quality evidence that manualized AA/TSF interventions are more effective than other established treatments, such as CBT, for increasing abstinence. Non-manualized AA/TSF may perform as well as these other established treatments. AA/TSF interventions, both manualized and non-manualized, may be at least as effective as other treatments for other alcohol-related outcomes. AA/TSF probably produces substantial healthcare cost savings among people with alcohol use disorder.",

Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of original, quantitative studies published between 1\u00a0November 1973 and 1\u00a0December 2018. The PRISMAGATHER were adhered to. The review protocol [includes FASD prevalence in (a) general and (b) special populations] is available on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016033837). Prevalence estimates were collated for all included studies with country-, disorder- [FASD and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)] and population-specific random-effects meta-analyses conducted. A number of service-defined subpopulations globally (see Findings). The main outcome was the prevalence of FASD among special subpopulations. The critical appraisal of each study was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool. We identified 69 studies, comprising 6177 individuals diagnosed with FASD from 17 countries: Australia (n\u00a0=\u00a05), Brazil (n\u00a0=\u00a02), Canada (n\u00a0=\u00a015), Chile (n\u00a0=\u00a04), eastern Europe (Moldova, Romania and Ukraine; n\u00a0=\u00a01), Germany (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Israel (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Lithuania (n\u00a0=\u00a01), the Netherlands (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Poland (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Russia (n\u00a0=\u00a09), South Korea (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Spain (n\u00a0=\u00a01), Sweden (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and United States (n\u00a0=\u00a025). FAS and FASD prevalence rates were collated for the following five subpopulations: children in care, correctional, special education, specialized clinical and Aboriginal populations. The estimated prevalence of FASD in these special subpopulations was 10-40 times higher compared with the 7.7 per 1000 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a04.9-11.7) global FASD prevalence in the general population. Global subpopulations of children in care, correctional, special education, specialized clinical and Aboriginal populations have a significantly higher prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder compared with the general population, which poses a substantial global health problem.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases, substance dependencies, and dental diseases are the most important health problems affecting incarcerated persons. In Germany, for example, prisoners are 48 to 69 times more likely to be infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) than the general population, and 7 to 12 times more likely to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The prevalence of mental illnesses is also markedly higher in the incarcerated than in the general population. This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in two databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) for any of the terms \"health care,\" \"primary health care,\" \"mental health care\"; \"infectious disease,\" \"opioid maintenance treatment,\" and \"severe mental disorder\" in conjunction with \"prison,\" \"jail,\" \"detention,\" and \"incarceration.\" Among prisoners in German prisons, approximately 20% consume heroin, 20-50% suffer from alcohol dependency and abuse, and 70-85% smoke. The prevalence of tuberculosis in German prisons in 2002 was 0.1%. The provision of needles to incarcerated persons has a preventive effect on infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV, yet programs of this type have been discontinued in most penal facilities. In a systematic review, psychotic disorders were found in 3.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [3.1; 4.2]) of male inmates and 3.9% [95% CI: 2.7; 5.0] of female inmates. 25% of incarcerated persons suffer from attention-deficit-hyperac- tivity disorder. Persons recently released from prison have an above average mortality, largely due to drug intoxication. An analysis of medical prescribing data reveals deficiencies in the provision of HCV treatment to all affected persons and in the provision of substitution treatment to persons with opiate dependency. In view of the known risks associated with imprisonment, greater emphasis should be placed on the provision of treatment for infectious diseases, substance dependencies, and mental illness, both in prison and in outpatient care after release.",

    "title": "A rapid systematic review of what we know about alcohol use disorders and brief interventions in the criminal justice system.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence of alcohol use disorders within the different stages of the criminal justice system in the UK. Furthermore it reviewed the worldwide evidence of alcohol brief interventions in the various stages of the criminal justice system. A rapid systematic review of publications was conducted from the year 2000 to 2014 regarding the prevalence of alcohol use disorders in the various stages of the criminal justice system. The second part of the work was a rapid review of effectiveness studies of interventions for alcohol brief interventions. Studies were included if they had a comparison group. Worldwide evidence was included that consisted of up to three hours of face-to-face brief intervention either in one session or numerous sessions. This review found that 64-88 per cent of adults in the police custody setting; 95 per cent in the magistrate court setting; 53-69 per cent in the probation setting and 5,913-863 per cent in the prison system and 64 per cent of young people in the criminal justice system in the UK scored positive for an alcohol use disorder. There is very little evidence of effectiveness of brief interventions in the various stages of the criminal justice system mainly due to the lack of follow-up data. Brief alcohol interventions have a large and robust evidence base for reducing alcohol use in risky drinkers, particularly in primary care settings. However, there is little evidence of effect upon drinking levels in criminal justice settings. Whilst the approach shows promise with some effects being shown on alcohol-related harm as well as with young people in the USA, more robust research is needed to ascertain effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions in this setting. This paper provides evidence of alcohol use disorders in the different stages of the criminal justice system in the UK using a validated tool as well as reviewing the worldwide evidence for short ( < three hours) alcohol brief intervention in this setting.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAdults with serious mental illness and comorbid alcohol dependence are at high risk for both high utilization of crisis-driven health care services and criminal justice involvement. Evidence-based medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for alcohol dependence may reduce both crisis service utilization and criminal recidivism. The authors estimated the effect of MAT on behavioral health treatment utilization and criminal justice outcomes for this population.\n\n\nMETHOD\nRelevant administrative data were merged from several public agencies in Connecticut for 5,743 adults \u226518 years old who had schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder comorbid with moderate to severe alcohol dependence and who were incarcerated for at least one night during the study window (2002-2009). Longitudinal multivariable regression models were used to estimate the effect of MAT compared with other outpatient substance abuse treatments on inpatient mental health and substance abuse hospitalizations, emergency department visits, criminal convictions, and incarcerations.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMAT was associated with significant improvements in clinical outcomes in the 12 months following initiation compared with non-MAT comparison treatment, including greater reductions in mental health hospitalization and emergency department visits and greater improvements in psychotropic medication adherence. No benefits of MAT were found for most criminal justice outcomes, except for significant reductions in felony convictions among adults with bipolar disorder.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMAT is underused for treating alcohol dependence, especially among adults with serious mental illness. These results suggest that MAT can have important benefits for clinical outcomes in this population. More research is needed to improve its use in this patient population as well as to address barriers to its availability.",

    "title": "Criminal Justice Diversion and the Importance of Program Retention",
    "abstract": "The United States has among the highest recidivism rates globally, with at least 1 in 4 rearrested within the same year of their initial charge. Many of these individuals are significantly impacted by poverty, mental illness, and substance use disorders. Recidivism reduction has become a significant focus of criminal justice reform and is gaining attention nationwide. Current scholarly literature suggests evidence-based reentry policies and programs can improve individual-level outcomes. This paper introduces the concept of diversion programming and measures how one diversion program impacted recidivism rates in a mid-sized metropolitan area of the US. Researchers examined one year's worth of data from 757 individuals released from the local county jail (January 2021 - December 2021) and calculated the average one-year recidivism rate comparing that of program participants to those of the larger community. Findings revealed that only 3.70% of those who completed this specific diversion program were rearrested within a year after their completion date. In comparison, members of the local community, who were not part of the program, were rearrested at a rate of 28.4%. Moreover, when clients were not retained in the program, recidivism rates were significantly higher at 31.22%. The authors suggest justice navigation-based diversion programs can effectively reduce recidivism if, and when, those programs ensure retention. This study can be a resource for future researchers, stakeholders, policymakers, and practitioners to support diversionary programming to reduce recidivism.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPersons in addiction treatment are likely to experience and/or witness drug overdoses following treatment and thus could benefit from overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) programs. Diverting individuals from the criminal justice system to addiction treatment represents one treatment engagement pathway, yet OEND needs among these individuals have not been fully described.MethodsWe characterized justice involvement patterns among 514 people who use opioids (PWUO) participating in a criminal justice diversion addiction treatment program during 2014\u20132016 using a gender-stratified latent class analysis. We described prevalence and correlates of naloxone knowledge using quasi-Poisson regression models with robust standard errors.ResultsOnly 56% of participants correctly identified naloxone as an opioid overdose treatment despite that 68% had experienced an overdose and 79% had witnessed another person overdose. We identified two latent justice involvement classes: low involvement (20.3% of men, 46.5% of women), characterized by older age at first arrest, more past-year arrests, and less time incarcerated; and high involvement (79.7% of men, 53.5% of women), characterized by younger age at first arrest and more lifetime arrests and time incarcerated. Justice involvement was not associated with naloxone knowledge. Male participants who had personally overdosed more commonly identified naloxone as an overdose treatment after adjustment for age, race, education level, housing status, heroin use, and injection drug use (prevalence ratio [95% confidence interval]: men 1.5 [1.1\u20132.0]).ConclusionsAll PWUO in criminal justice diversion programs could benefit from OEND given the high propensity to experience and witness overdoses and low naloxone knowledge across justice involvement backgrounds and genders.",

Multilevel survival models were used for two outcomes measuring time (in days) to any arrest and to any substance-related arrest. Community characteristics included a factor measuring community economic disadvantage and the proportions of residents in the client's residential census tract who were Black, Latino, or American Indian/Alaskan Native.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWhen we controlled for age, sex, substance use, referral source, and prior criminal justice involvement, Black clients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.47, p < .01) had a higher hazard of any arrest compared with White clients, and Black (HR = 1.27, p < .05) and Latino (HR = 1.20, p < .05) clients had a higher hazard of a substance-related arrest. Clients living in census tracts with a higher proportion of Black residents had a higher hazard of any arrest (HR = 1.25, p < .01) as well as substance-related arrests (HR = 1.39, p < .01). Community characteristics did not account for racial/ethnic disparities in arrests but provided an independent effect.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nDisparities in arrest outcomes are influenced by both individual- and community-level factors; therefore, strategies for reducing disparities in this treatment outcome should be implemented at both levels.",

    "title": "Criminal justice outcomes over 5 years after randomization to buprenorphine-naloxone or methadone treatment for opioid use disorder.",
    "abstract": "AIMS\nTo compare long-term criminal justice outcomes among opioid-dependent individuals randomized to receive buprenorphine or methadone.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\nA 5-year follow-up was conducted in 2011-14 of 303 opioid-dependent participants entering three opioid treatment programs in California, USA in 2006-09 and randomized to receive either buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone.\n\n\nINTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR\nParticipants received buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP; n\u00a0=\u00a0179) or methadone (MET; n\u00a0=\u00a0124) for 24\u00a0weeks and then were tapered off their treatment over \u2264\u00a08\u00a0weeks or referred for ongoing clinical treatment. Midway through the study, the randomization scheme was switched from 1\u00a0:\u00a01 BUP\u00a0:\u00a0MET to 2\u00a0:\u00a01 because of higher dropout in the BUP arm.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nStudy outcomes included arrests and self-reported incarceration. Predictors included randomization condition (buprenorphine versus methadone), age, gender, race/ethnicity, use of cocaine, drug injection in the 30\u00a0days prior to baseline and study site. Treatment status (buprenorphine, methadone, none) during follow-up was included as a time-varying covariate.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThere was no significant difference by randomization condition in the proportion arrested (buprenorphine: 55.3%, methadone: 54.0%) or incarcerated (40.9%, 47.3%) during follow-up. Among methadone-randomized individuals, arrest was less likely with methadone treatment (0.50, 0.35-0.72) during follow-up (relative to no treatment) and switching to buprenorphine had a lower likelihood of arrest than those receiving no treatment (0.39, 0.18-0.87). Among buprenorphine-randomized individuals, arrest was less likely with receipt of buprenorphine (0.49, 0.33-0.75) during follow-up and switching to methadone had a similar likelihood of arrest as methadone-randomized individuals receiving no treatment. Likelihood of arrest was also negatively associated with older age (0.98, 0.96-1.00); it was positively associated with Hispanic ethnicity (1.63, 1.04-2.56), cocaine use (2.00, 1.33-3.03), injection drug use (2.19, 1.26-3.83), and study site.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn a US sample of people treated for opioid use disorder, continued treatment with either buprenorphine or methadone was associated with a reduction in arrests relative to no treatment. Cocaine use, injection drug use, Hispanic ethnicity and younger age were associated with higher likelihood of arrest.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nMental health courts provide an alternative to incarceration and address both mental health and criminal justice needs. Many individuals within these treatment courts also have co-occurring substance use disorders. This pilot study examined the preliminary effectiveness of Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Criminal Justice (MISSION-CJ), an intervention that targets co-occurring disorders and criminal justice risk factors within a mental health court.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants (N=97) were enrolled in mental health court and MISSION-CJ community wraparound services.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants were primarily male with an average age of 34, had spent an average of more than 5 years incarcerated, and had an average of 13.94 years of illegal drug use; 91% had experienced depression. Preliminary 6-month outcomes showed significant reduction in nights incarcerated (p<0.002), illegal drug use (p<0.003), trauma symptoms (p<0.004), and behavioral health symptoms (p<0.006).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPreliminary findings suggest promise for delivery of MISSION-CJ to participants in a mental health court.",

    "abstract": "Purpose of review Polysubstance use, broadly defined as using more than one type of substance, disproportionately impacts those involved in the criminal justice system (CJS). This review synthesizes recent findings on polysubstance use among those involved in the CJS and highlights areas of particular concern and interventions. Recent findings We use 18 recent articles to identify the prevalence and types of criminal justice involvement and correlates of polysubstance use and criminal justice involvement. We highlight latent patterns of polysubstance use among various criminal justice populations (adults, pregnant women, and youth) and differential associations with adverse substance use and criminal justice outcomes. Lastly, we discuss substance use treatment in the justice system, the role of polysubstance use in treatment access and outcomes, and substance use-related services for previously incarcerated individuals reentering society. Summary Current research provides further evidence of the syndemic nature of polysubstance use, criminal justice involvement, and adverse outcomes, which are complicated by significant barriers to accessing evidence-based treatment in justice settings. Yet, current research is limited due to methodological inconsistency and limited focus on the social determinants of health, racial/ethnic disparities, and interventions to increase treatment and reentry services.",

    "title": "Opioid Agonist Treatment Recipients within Criminal Justice-Involved Populations",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background: In 2014, nearly 2.5 million Americans had a substance use disorder for opioids (e.g., prescription pain medication or heroin) with over half estimated to have had prior contact with the criminal justice system. Despite strong evidence that opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is effective in reducing overdose, increasing treatment retention, and improving physical health and well-being outcomes, the use of OAT among justice-involved individuals is relatively rare. Methods: The current study uses national data of publicly funded admissions to substance abuse treatment to assess the extent to which OAT is used for cases referred to treatment by the criminal justice system. We explore the relationship between demographics, substance use severity, and access to treatment and OAT receipt. Results: Findings indicate that fewer than 6% of criminal justice cases received OAT as part of the treatment plan. Those with daily substance use, comorbid psychiatric problems, prior treatment, females, Latinos, and those who were older and those who were living independently were more likely to receive OAT, as were those living in the Northeast and with government health insurance. Conclusions: Improving the integration of the criminal justice system with substance use treatment programs would improve access to care and potentially reduce multiple health disparities faced by those in the justice system. As criminal justice responses to substance use disorder move toward a public health approach, it is imperative that the criminal justice system consider mechanisms for improving access and referrals to OAT.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nSubstance use treatment (SUT) has shown to be effective in reducing self-reported offending; however, the association between SUT completion and criminal justice system (CJS) contact has been underexplored, especially in Latin America. This study aimed to estimate the association between SUT completion status and (1) any subsequent CJS contact and (2) CJS contact leading to imprisonment, at 1, 3 and 5\u00a0years post-discharge, in Chile.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRetrospective cohort study using multivariable survival analysis based on linked administrative data from 2010 to 2019.\n\n\nSETTING\nThis study took place in Chile, where SUT is available at no cost through Chile's publicly funded health-care, and is provided in outpatient and inpatient modalities in public and private centres.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nA total of 70\u2009854 individuals received their first SUT from 2010 to 2019. They were mainly males (76.3%), and their main substance used at admission was cocaine paste (39.2%).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nSUT completion status included completion, late dropout (\u2265\u00a03\u00a0months) and early dropout (<\u20093\u00a0months). Outcomes were (1) any CJS contact and (2) CJS contact leading to imprisonment after baseline treatment. We estimated the association between treatment completion and CJS contact through flexible parametric Royston-Parmar models while adjusting for several covariates.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nThose who completed SUT (27.2%) were less likely to have any CJS contact at 5\u00a0years post-SUT compared with those who dropped out late [with a gap of -9.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-8.7, -10.3] and early (-11.2%, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-10.1, -12.3). Also, those who completed SUT were less likely to have CJS contact leading to imprisonment at 5\u00a0years post-SUT compared with those who dropped out late (-2.6%, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-2.2, -3.1) and early (-4.0%, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-3.3, -4.6). These differences were also observed at 1 and 3\u00a0years post-SUT for each outcome.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn Chile, completion of substance use treatment appears to be associated with lower probabilities of both any criminal justice system contact and contact leading to imprisonment.",

    "title": "Methamphetamine use, health and criminal justice system outcomes: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "ISSUES\nMethamphetamine use is a problem for health and criminal justice systems (CJS) worldwide. Methamphetamine is used at higher rates in CJS-involved populations than the general community. This systematic review synthesises the evidence for health and CJS outcomes post-CJS contact for people reporting pre-CJS methamphetamine use.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nAcademic databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed original studies using a longitudinal design that investigated associations between pre-CJS methamphetamine use and health and criminal justice outcomes after CJS contact. Identified studies were screened in two stages: title and abstract, then full-text. Data from the included studies were extracted and analysed. Results are reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nNine studies met the inclusion criteria: five investigated health and four investigated CJS outcomes. Pre-CJS methamphetamine use was associated with subsequent hospitalisation for drug-induced psychosis, increased risk of recidivism and higher crime costs after CJS contact. Pre-CJS methamphetamine use was not associated with subsequent hospitalisation for non-drug induced psychosis or post-release mortality.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nCurrent evidence suggests that pre-CJS contact methamphetamine use increases the risk of subsequent drug-induced psychosis and recidivism. There is a need for more longitudinal research that measures mediators and moderators of health and criminal justice outcomes after CJS contact, to inform targeted prevention.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMethamphetamine use is a major problem that is contributing to serious mental illness and recidivism among CJS-involved populations. Prioritising treatment during CJS contact is recommended. Further research to identify key opportunities during health service and CJS contact for intervention is needed.",

    "title": "Impact of a community-policing initiative promoting substance use disorder treatment over criminal charges on arrest recidivism.",
    "abstract": "Overdose deaths, addiction, and drug-related crime have increased in the United States over the past decade. Treatment improves outcomes, including reducing crime, but few individuals with addiction receive treatment. Here, we determine whether the Madison Addiction Recovery Initiative (MARI), a community policing program implemented by the City of Madison (Wisconsin) Police Department (MPD) that diverts adults who committed a non-violent, drug use-related crime from criminal prosecution to addiction treatment, reduces the risk of recidivism (i.e., an arrest) in the 6-month period following the index crime. Observational data were collected by the MPD for 12 months before through 6 months after an index crime from participants in the MARI program (n\u2009=\u2009263) who referred to MARI between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2020 and a Historical Comparison group (n\u2009=\u200952) who committed a comparable crime between September 1, 2015 and August 31, 2016. Average effects were estimated using intention-to-treat (ITT), a per-protocol, and a complier average causal effects (CACE) analyses, adjusted for covariates. ITT analysis did not show that MARI assignment lowered adjusted odds of 6-month recidivism (aOR\u2009=\u20090.59 [0.32, 1.12], p\u2009=\u20090.11). Per-protocol analysis showed that completing MARI lowered the adjusted odds of 6-month recidivism (aOR\u2009=\u20090.23 [0.10, 0.52], p\u2009<\u20090.001). CACE analysis indicated that assignment to MARI among individuals who would complete the MARI program if assigned to the program lowered the adjusted odds of 6-month recidivism (aOR\u2009=\u20090.85 [0.80, 0.90], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Diverting adults who committed a non-violent, drug use-related crime from criminal prosecution to addiction treatment may reduce 6-month recidivism.",

    "abstract": "Criminal justice involved (CJS) populations with opioid use disorder (OUD) have high rates of relapse, future arrests, and death upon release. While medication for OUD (MOUD) reduces opioid relapse, concerns regarding diversion and stigma limit treatment in CJS populations. Extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX), as an opioid antagonist, may be more acceptable to CJS administrators. However, the impact of XR-NTX on criminal recidivism remains unknown. Arrest data from a published randomized trial comparing XR-NTX to treatment as usual (TAU) was captured by self-report and official state arrest records. Comparisons of future arrests, time to first arrest and total number of arrests were performed using chi square tests and multivariable generalized regression models. Secondary outcomes explored differences in arrests by type and severity of crime, use of opioid and other drugs, and study phase. Of 308 participants randomized, 300 had arrest data. The incidence of arrests did not differ between XR-NTX (47.6%) and TAU (42.5%) participants. (ChiSq p\u2009=\u20090.37). Additionally, there was no significant difference in time to first arrest (adjusted HR 1.35, CI 0.96-1.89) and number of arrests per participant (adjusted IR 1.33, CI 0.78-2.27). Controlling for gender, age, previous criminal activity, and use of non-opioid drugs, logistic regression demonstrated no significant difference in incidence of arrests between groups (adjusted OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.85-2.22). We detected no significant difference in arrests between CJS participants with OUD randomized to XR-NTX or TAU. Despite its efficacy in reducing opioid use, XR-NTX alone may be insufficient to reduce criminal recidivism.",

    "title": "Alternate policing strategies: Cost-effectiveness of cautioning for cannabis offences.",
    "abstract": "There is increasing international interest in alternatives to the use of arrest for minor drug offences. While Australia has been at the forefront in the provision of diversionary programs for minor drug offences there remain key gaps in knowledge about the cost-effectiveness of different approaches. Here we set out to assess the cost-effectiveness of cannabis cautioning schemes whereby police refer minor cannabis use and possession offenders to education and/or treatment instead of arresting and charging them. This study used a purpose built nation-wide online survey to evaluate cost-effectiveness of cannabis cautioning versus a traditional response for minor cannabis offences (arrest). The survey was completed by a self-selected group of detected cannabis offenders. The outcome measure was self-reported cannabis use days in the previous month post-intervention. Cost data included costs of policing, court, penalties, assessment, treatment and educational sessions. Propensity score weighting and doubly robust regression analyses were utilised to address differences between the groups. There were 195 respondents who reported being arrested for a cannabis possession/use offence and 355 who reported receiving a formal cannabis caution. After matching on a range of characteristics (age, prior criminal conviction, cannabis consumption, employment status, self-reported criminal activity prior to detection, severity of dependence) there was no statistically significant difference in cannabis use pre- and post-police intervention between the two groups(N=544). After matching and bootstrapping the costs there was a significant difference in costs; the mean cost for the charge group (net of fines) was $733 (SD 151) and $388 (SD 111) for the caution group. These results indicate that after matching on a range of relevant characteristics there were no differences across groups in the change in self-reported cannabis use days, but cannabis cautioning was less costly than charge/arrest. These results add to the evidence about the efficacy and desirability of alternatives to arrest both within Australia and abroad.",

    "abstract": "The societal costs of problematic class A drug use in England and Wales exceed \u00a315B; drug-related crime accounts for almost 90% of costs. Diversion plus treatment and/or aftercare programmes may reduce drug-related crime and costs. To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of diversion and aftercare for class A drug-using offenders, compared with no diversion. Adult class A drug-using offenders diverted to treatment or an aftercare programme for their drug use. Programmes to identify and divert problematic drug users to treatment (voluntary, court mandated or monitored services) at any point within the criminal justice system (CJS). Aftercare follows diversion and treatment, excluding care following prison or non-diversionary drug treatment. Thirty-three electronic databases and government online resources were searched for studies published between January 1985 and January 2012, including MEDLINE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science. Bibliographies of identified studies were screened. The UK Drug Data Warehouse, the UK Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study and published statistics and reports provided data for the economic evaluation. Included studies evaluated diversion in adult class A drug-using offenders, in contact with the CJS. The main outcomes were drug use and offending behaviour, and these were pooled using meta-analysis. The economic review included full economic evaluations for adult opiate and/or crack, or powder, cocaine users. An economic decision analytic model, estimated incremental costs per unit of outcome gained by diversion and aftercare, over a 12-month time horizon. The perspectives included the CJS, NHS, social care providers and offenders. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analysis explored variance in parameter estimates, longer time horizons and structural uncertainty. Sixteen studies met the effectiveness review inclusion criteria, characterised by poor methodological quality, with modest sample sizes, high attrition rates, retrospective data collection, limited follow-up, no random allocation and publication bias. Most study samples comprised US methamphetamine users. Limited meta-analysis was possible, indicating a potential small impact of diversion interventions on reducing drug use [odds ratio (OR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 2.53 for reduced primary drug use, and OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.98 for reduced use of other drugs]. The cost-effectiveness review did not identify any relevant studies. The economic evaluation indicated high uncertainty because of variance in data estimates and limitations in the model design. The primary analysis was unclear whether or not diversion was cost-effective. The sensitivity analyses indicated some scenarios where diversion may be cost-effective. Nearly all participants (99.6%) in the effectiveness review were American (Californian) methamphetamine users, limiting transfer of conclusions to the UK. Data and methodological limitations mean it is unclear whether or not diversion is effective or cost-effective. High-quality evidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of diversion schemes is sparse and does not relate to the UK. Importantly this research identified a range of methodological limitations in existing evidence. These highlight the need for research to conceptualise, define and develop models of diversion programmes and identify a core outcome set. A programme of feasibility, pilot and definitive trials, combined with process evaluation and qualitative research is recommended to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of diversionary interventions in class A drug-using offenders.

We systematically searched for controlled evaluations examining the effects of U.S.-based JDTCs relative to traditional juvenile adjudication and used mixed-effects meta-regressions with robust variance estimates. We identified 55 eligible samples (providing data from 12,310 participants); the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. The average graduation rate among JDTC participants was 54.74% (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.50, 0.59]). JDTCs had modest beneficial effects on general recidivism assessed during court supervision (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% CI [1.03, 1.84]) but these effects did not persist after program completion. Correlational analyses suggest JDTCs may be effective when program enrollment and service provision are better tailored to youth\u2019s treatment needs. However, due partly to implementation failures, JDTCs may have minimal to no effects on postprogram recidivism.",

    "title": "The global distribution and epidemiology of alcohol and drug use among street-involved children and youth: a meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Street-involved children and youth (SICY) who work and live on/of the streets are more likely to inject drugs and engage in psychoactive substance use. Objectives: The present study aimed to identify the prevalence, distribution, sociodemographic determinants, and risk-taking associated with alcohol and drug use among SICY. Methods: Studies published in English related to alcohol and drug use among SICY were searched for from December 1 1985 to July 1 2022, on PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. Results: After full-text paper evaluation, 73 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results indicated that lifetime prevalence rates were 44% (alcohol), 44% (crack), 33% (inhalants), 44% (solvents), 16% (tranquilizer/sedatives), 22% (opioids), and 62% (polysubstance use). The current prevalence rates were 40% (alcohol), 21% (crack), 20% (inhalants), 11% (tranquilizer/sedatives), and 1% (opioids). Also, life-time and current prevalence of alcohol and crack use, current prevalence of tranquilizer/sedative use, and life-time prevalence of polysubstance use were higher among older age groups. Life-time prevalence of tranquilizer/sedative use was lower among older age groups. Conclusions: The high prevalence of using alcohol, crack, and inhalants is a major issue because they are used extensively among different age groups, including minors. Such findings are beneficial for policymakers, health authorities, and professionals in developing programs aimed at minimizing inhalant use and other types of substance use harms among this group. It is important to accurately monitor this risk-exposed population to understand the mechanisms that might help protect them from high-risk substance use.",

    "title": "Assessing the Effectiveness of Mental Health Courts in Reducing Recidivism: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Mental Health Courts (MHCs) are a type of treatment court created to divert offenders with mental illness away from incarceration and into community-based treatment. While research on the impact of MHCs on recidivism has produced mixed results, there is a need to determine whether MHCs are effective. In light of this need, and of public support for the balanced justice approach toward mentally ill offenders, this study aims to assess the impact of MHC participation on recidivism. As such, the current study is a systematic review and a meta-analysis which replicates a study conducted by Lowder and colleagues while incorporating modifications to the methodology to reflect the new Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to determine the effect of MHC participation on recidivism. Results from the 15 included studies show a significant reduction (42.46%) in recidivism for individuals who participated in MHC treatment program. Policy implications, in light of the MHC model\u2019s reduction in recidivism and alignment with the ideals of balanced justice, are discussed.",

    "title": "Cumulative Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Recidivism: A Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "This meta-analysis quantitatively synthesizes existing literature to investigate the relationship between aggregations of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and recidivism among court-involved youth and adults. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and moderation analyses were conducted. Sixteen studies (published n = 12), encompassing 101,778 unique participants (girls/women = 21.1%; adults n = 1,204), met the inclusion criteria. A small overall effect size revealed that an accumulation of ACEs increased the odds of reoffending. The relationship between ACEs and recidivism was only statistically significant for the subgroup of studies using youth samples. In addition, ACEs only predicted recidivism in the subgroup of published studies (compared to dissertations). Other moderators (gender, study location, recidivism time frame) were not significant. Our results suggest that courts, particularly youth courts, would benefit from screening for cumulative ACEs to help identify those most at risk for reoffending and in need of intervention.",

    "title": "Time to sputum culture conversion and its associated factors among drug-resistant tuberculosis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Objective We aimed to evaluate the sputum culture conversion time of DR-TB patients and its related factors. Methods PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, CNKI, Wan Fang, CBM and VIP databases were electronically searched to collect studies on sputum culture conversion time in patients with DR-TB. Meta-analysis was performed by using the R 4.3.0 version and Stata 16 software. Results A total of 45 studies involving 17373 patients were included. Meta-analysis results showed that the pooled median time to sputum culture conversion was 68.57\u00a0days (IQR 61.01,76.12). The median time of sputum culture conversion in patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis was different in different WHO regions, countries with different levels of development and different treatment schemes. And female ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.59,95% CI: s 0.46,0.76), alcohol history ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.70,95% CI: 0.50,0.98), smoking history (a HR \u2009=\u20090.58,95% CI: 0.38,0.88), history of SLD use ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.64,95% CI: 0.47,0.87), BMI\u2009<\u200918.5\u00a0kg/m^2 ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.69,95% CI: 0.60,0.80), lung cavity ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.70,95% CI: 0.52,0.94), sputum smear grading at baseline (Positive) ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.56,95% CI: 0.36,0.87), (grade 1^+) ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.87,95% CI: 0.77,0.99), (grade 2^+) ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.81,95% CI: 0.69,0.95), (grade 3^+) ( aHR \u2009=\u20090.71,95% CI: 0.61,0.84) were the related factor of sputum culture conversion time in patients with DR-TB. Conclusion Patients with DR-TB in Europe or countries with high level of economic development have earlier sputum culture conversion, and the application of bedaquiline can make patients have shorter sputum culture conversion time. Female, alcohol history, smoking history, history of SLD use, BMI\u2009<\u200918.5\u00a0kg/m^2, lung cavity, sputum smear grading at baseline (Positive, grade 1^+, grade 2^+, grade 3^+) may be risk factors for longer sputum culture conversion time.

    "title": "Factors Associated with Revictimization in Intimate Partner Violence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "This study conducted a meta-analysis to identify the primary risk and protective factors associated with the revictimization in intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW). Out of 2382 studies initially identified in eight databases, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria and provided the necessary data for calculating pooled effect sizes. The analysis focused on non-manipulative quantitative studies examining revictimization in heterosexual women of legal age. Separate statistical analyses were performed for prospective and retrospective studies, resulting in findings related to 14 variables. The Metafor package in RStudio was used with a random-effects model. The meta-analysis revealed that childhood abuse was the most strongly associated risk factor for revictimization, while belonging to a white ethnicity was the most prominent protective factor. Other significant risk factors included alcohol and drug use, recent physical violence, severity of violence, and PTSD symptomatology. The study also found that older age was a protective factor in prospective studies. The consistency of results across different study designs and sensitivity analyses further supported the robustness of the findings. It is important to note that the existing literature on revictimization in women facing intimate partner violence is limited and exhibits significant heterogeneity in terms of methodology and conceptual frameworks.",

    "title": "Risk factors for suicide reattempt: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Suicide is one of the main external causes of death worldwide. People who have already attempted suicide are at high risk of new suicidal behavior. However, there is a lack of information on the risk factors that facilitate the appearance of reattempts. The aim of this study was to calculate the risk of suicide reattempt in the presence of suicidal history and psychosocial risk factors and to estimate the effect of each individual risk factor. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA-2020 guidelines. Studies on suicide reattempt that measured risk factors were searched from inception to 2022. The risk factors studied were those directly related to suicide history: history of suicide prior to the index attempt, and those that mediate the transition from suicidal ideation to attempt (alcohol or drug misuse, impulsivity, trauma, and non-suicidal self-injury). Results The initial search resulted in 11 905 articles. Of these, 34 articles were selected for this meta-analysis, jointly presenting 52 different effect sizes. The pooled effect size across the risk factors was significant (OR 2.16). Reattempt risk may be increased in presence of any of the following risk factors: previous history, active suicidal ideation, trauma, alcohol misuse, and drug misuse. However, impulsivity, and non-suicidal self-injury did not show a significant effect on reattempt. Conclusion Most of the risk factors traditionally associated with suicide are also relevant when talking about suicide reattempts. Knowing the traits that define reattempters can help develop better preventive and intervention plans.",

    "title": "Sex Differences in Mental Health Symptoms in Elite Athletes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Context: Mental health is a growing area of concern for elite athletes. Objective: To determine the sex differences in mental health symptoms in elite athletes. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were used. Study Selection: Included studies included comparisons of mental health symptoms of athletes by sex. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Level of Evidence: Level 2a. Data Extraction: The rate ratio (RR) was calculated as the rates in female and male athletes. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Results: Of 1945 articles identified, 60 articles were included. Male athletes reported higher alcohol misuse (RR, 0.74; CI, 0.68-0.80), illicit drug abuse (RR, 0.82; CI, 0.75-0.89), and gambling problems (RR, 0.14; CI, 0.08-0.25). Female athletes reported higher overall anxiety (RR, 1.17; CI, 1.08-1.27), depression (RR, 1.42; CI, 1.31-1.54), distress (RR, 1.98; CI, 1.40-2.81), and disordered eating (RR, 2.19; CI, 1.58-3.02). Sleep disturbances were reported at similar rates in male and female athletes (RR, 1.13; CI, 0.98-1.30). Conclusion: Female and male athletes have significant differences in reported mental health symptoms. Female athletes are more likely to report anxiety, depression, distress, and disordered eating, while male athletes report more alcohol misuse, illicit drug abuse, and gambling. Monitoring and evaluation of mental health is a necessary part of any sport, including access to resources. Longitudinal studies following athletes over time to determine the development and causation for mental health symptoms should be included in future research directions.",

    "title": "A META-ANALYSIS OF CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION IN GRC PLATFORMS: EVIDENCE FROM U.S. ENTERPRISE AUDITS",
    "abstract": "This meta-analysis critically examines the integration of cybersecurity frameworks into Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platforms and its impact on audit performance, compliance outcomes, and enterprise risk management across U.S.-based organizations. Leveraging quantitative data from 78 peer-reviewed studies and industry reports published between 2010 and 2024, the research aggregates and evaluates the effectiveness of implementing widely recognized cybersecurity frameworks\u2014including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), ISO/IEC 27001, COBIT, and CIS Controls\u2014within digital GRC environments. Using a random-effects model to account for sectoral and methodological heterogeneity, the study calculates standardized effect sizes and analyzes how such integrations influence key organizational metrics such as audit exception rates, control failure frequency, policy adherence levels, risk visibility, and regulatory response capabilities. The findings demonstrate statistically significant improvements in audit readiness, reduction in compliance violations, enhanced policy enforcement, and faster detection and containment of security incidents when cybersecurity frameworks are embedded within GRC systems. Sector-specific insights reveal that financial services, healthcare, and federal agencies benefit the most from integration, attributed to higher regulatory scrutiny and more mature risk governance infrastructures. In contrast, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), along with sectors reliant on legacy systems, face implementation challenges related to system interoperability, workforce skill gaps, and resource constraints. The analysis also identifies key enablers of successful integration, including leadership engagement, cross-functional governance teams, standardized control taxonomies, and continuous training programs. Additionally, behavioral factors such as user acceptance, organizational culture, and change management practices significantly influence the long-term sustainability of integration efforts. This study contributes a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of how cybersecurity-GRC convergence enhances operational efficiency, regulatory alignment, and strategic resilience. The results offer practical implications for CISOs, compliance officers, IT auditors, and executive leadership seeking to modernize governance processes, manage cyber risks more proactively, and meet evolving regulatory expectations in an increasingly complex digital landscape.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is quickly spreading around the world and carries along with it a significant threat to public health. This study sought to apply meta-analysis to more precisely and accurately estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the isolation policy across countries, and the corresponding public health capability to care for patients. Prior estimates of R0 have varied widely and range from 1.95 to 6.49. Utilizing meta-analysis techniques we determined a more robust estimation of 3.05 for R0, which is substantially larger than that provided by the WHO. We also present the infectious rate standardized to per million population, which has proved to be a good index to determine whether the isolation measures in specific countries are effective. Also, this standardized infection rate can be used to determine whether the current infectious severity status is out of range of the national health capacity. Finally, we utilize our robust estimate of R0 and the standardized infectious rate to illustrate that the early and aggressive isolation measures enforced by the Chinese government were substantially more effective in controlling the negative impact COVID-19 than the more permissive measures enacted early in Italy and the United States.",

    "title": "What Have We Learned From Offender Profiling? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 40 Years of Research",
    "abstract": "In the 4 decades since offender profiling (OP) was established, hundreds of journal articles, books, book chapters, reports, and magazine articles have been published on the topic, and the technique has been used by countless law enforcement agencies around the globe. However, despite the popularity and extensive literature published on OP, very little is known about its evolution, current state, or findings of the field to date. Therefore, this study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of 426 publications on OP from 1976 through 2016. Results of this systematic review suggest that there have been considerable improvements in the scientific rigor and self-assessment being conducted in the discipline, although in total, few studies have used a strong empirical approach to develop new profiles. Even fewer evaluations of the effectiveness of OP have been conducted. The first summary of offender profiles proposed for major crimes in OP literature is also presented, with results indicating some recurrent themes in profiles, but wide variations in the number, name, and description of the profiles often found. A meta-analysis of case linkage analysis research indicates that this area is statistically sophisticated, and has yielded moderate to strong accuracy rates for linking crimes to a single offender. Finally, the first analysis of the most prolific authors, researchers, departments, and outlets for OP research, and the methods, approach, and most cited publications in OP are identified. Suggestions for future research on OP and the potential impact that this may have on policy and practice are also discussed.",

    "title": "Mann-Kendall test for Monotonic Trend Analysis of Driving Under Intoxicated (DUI) Arrests in the United States: 1995-2013",
    "abstract": "Drinking under the Influence (DUI) remains to be a public health issue as there has still been a significant number of traffic deaths and injuries due to DUI. Despite the laws enacted and the impacts of DUI highly publicized, the high percentage of people still perceiving DUI as a major personal safety threat furthers the need to review the status of DUIs in this country. There are various agencies in this country that has gathered DUI data in one way or the other. However, making sense of these available information for policy planning purposes on a comprehensive manner remains to be a challenge. It is to this purpose that this study endeavors to review the trends on DUI utilizing existing data gathered by various agencies. Specifically, the objective is to determine whether there has been a statistically significant decrease in the number of DUI arrests from 1995 to 2013. Data on Driving under the Influence (DUI) arrests were drawn from information provided to the Federal Bureau of Investigations\u2019 (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) from 1995 to 2013. The FBI\u2019s UCR Program is a nationwide, cooperative statistical effort of more than 16,000 in 1995 and in 2013, 18,415 city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily reporting data on crimes brought to their attention (Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), 1995). From 1995 to 2013, the average number of individuals arrested for DUI accounted for 10 percent (14,107,840) of the total arrests in the US. Results revealed during this period; the number of DUI arrests has decreased by 9 percent with an average yearly rate change of 1 percent. The highest increase of the DUI arrests during this period was observed in 1999 with 8 percent, while the highest decrease was observed in 2011 with 14 percent. The year that had the highest number of DUI arrests was in 1999 while the lowest was in 2013. The analysis also revealed that there was a decrease in the total number of DUI arrests from 1995 to 2013 as pointed out by the negative value of the computed Z (Z (S > 0) = -1.77, p = .076). However, there was no statistically significant trend as the normalized test statistic (Z) was less than the critical value (Z\u03b1/2 = 1.96) at the level of significance (0.05). The paper concludes that in order to gauge the effectiveness of prevention measures, there is a need to regularly monitor trends in alcohol-impaired driving. There are several approaches adopted by previous studies to examine these trends, which includes onsite surveys of drivers, examination of crash reports and driver\u2019s records. However, developing an approach that utilizes existing sources of data would be the most efficient and effective in terms of time and monetary resources.",

Fifteen years after its conception, we analysed the rigorous counterfactual-based evidence for environmental and welfare effects from such national and subnational initiatives, along with a Theory of Change. Using machine-learning tools for literature review, we compared 32 quantitative studies including 26 primary forest-related and 12 socioeconomic effect sizes. Average environmental impacts were positively significant yet moderately sized, comparable to impacts from other conservation tools, and mostly impermanent over time. Socioeconomic impacts were welfare-neutral to slightly positive. Moderator analysis showed that environmental additionality was likely restricted by project proponents\u2019 adverse spatial targeting of low-threat areas. Scarce funding flows from carbon markets and ill-enforced conditionality probably also limited impacts. Hence, important policy and implementation lessons emerge for boosting effectiveness in the current global transition towards larger-scale, jurisdictional action. Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation initiatives have moderately helped to conserve forests while delivering minor benefits to local people, according to a meta-analysis of 32 quantitative studies.",

The review aims to compare effects of safety interventions to no intervention, usual activities, or alternative intervention, and if possible, to examine which constituent components of safety intervention programs contribute more strongly to preventing accidents at work in a given setting or context.

Gray literature were identified by searching OSH ROM and Google. No language or date restrictions were applied. Searches done between February and July of 2015 included PubMed (1966), Embase (1980), CINAHL (1981), OSH ROM (NIOSHTIC 1977, HSELINE 1977, CIS\u2010DOC 1974), PsycINFO (1806), EconLit (1969), Web of Science (1969), and ProQuest (1861); dates represent initial availability of each database. Websites of pertinent institutions (NIOSH, Perosh) were also searched. Study Eligibility Criteria, Participants, and Interventions Included studies had to focus on accidents at work, include an evaluation of a safety intervention, and have used injuries at work, or a relevant proxy, as an outcome measure. Experimental, quasi\u2010experimental, and observational study designs were utilized, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after (CBA) studies, and observational designs using serial measures (interrupted time series, retrospective cohort designs, and before and after studies using multiple measures). Interventions were classified by approach at the individual or group level, and broad categories based on the prevention approach including modification of: Attitudes (through information and persuasive campaign messaging). Behaviors (through training, incentives, goal setting, feedback/coaching). Physiological condition (by physical training). Climate/norms/culture (by coaching, feedback, modification of safety management/leadership). Structural conditions (including physical environment, engineering, legislation and enforcement, sectorial\u2010level norms). When combined approaches were used, interventions were termed \u201cmultifaceted,\u201d and when an approach(es) is applied to more than one organizational level (e.g., individual, group, and/or organization), it is termed \u201cacross levels.\u201d Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Narrative report review captured industry (NACE), work setting, participant characteristics, theoretical basis for approach, intervention fidelity, research design, risk of bias, contextual detail, outcomes measures and results. Additional items were extracted for studies with serial measures including approaches to improve internal validity, assessments of reasonable statistical approaches (Effective Practice of Organization of Care [EPOC] criteria) and overall inference. Random\u2010effects inverse variance weighted meta\u2010analytic methods were used to synthesize odds ratios, rate ratios, or standardized mean differences for the outcomes for RCT and CBA studies with low or moderate levels of heterogeneity. For studies with greater heterogeneity and those using serial measures, we relied on narrative analyses to synthesize findings. Results In total 100 original studies were included for synthesis analysis, including 16 RCT study designs, 30 CBA study designs, and 54 studies using serial measures (ITS study designs). These studies represented 120 cases of safety interventions. The number of participants included 31,971,908 individuals in 59 safety interventions, 417,693 groups/firms in 35 safety interventions, and 15,505 injuries in 17 safety interventions. Out of the 59 safety interventions, two were evaluating national prevention measures, which alone accounted for 31,667,110 individuals. The remaining nine safety interventions used other types of measures, such as safety exposure, safety observations, gloves or claim rates. Strong evidence supports greater effects being achieved with safety interventions directed toward the group or organization level rather than individual behavior change. Engineering controls are more effective at reducing injuries than other approaches, particularly when engineered changes can be introduced without requiring \u201cdecision\u2010to\u2010use\u201d by workplaces. Multifaceted approaches combining intervention elements on the organizational level, or across levels, provided moderate to strong effects, in particular when engineering controls were included. Interventions based on firm epidemiologic evidence of causality and a strong conceptual approach were more effective. Effects that are more modest were observed (in short follow\u2010up) for safety climate interventions, using techniques such as feedback or leadership training to improve safety communication. There was limited evidence for a strong effect at medium\u2010term with more intense counseling approaches. Evidence supports regulation/legislation as contributing to the prevention of accidents at work, but with lower effect sizes. Enforcement appears to work more consistently, but with smaller effects. In general, the results were consistent with previous systematic reviews of specific types of safety interventions, although the effectiveness of economic incentives to prevent accidents at work was not consistent with our results, and effectiveness of physiological safety intervention was only consistent to some extent. Limitations Acute musculoskeletal injuries and injuries from more long\u2010time workplace exposures were not always clearly distinguished in research reports. In some studies acute and chronic exposures were mixed, resulting in inevitable misclassification. Of note, the classification of these events also remains problematic in clinical medicine. It was not possible to conduct meta\u2010analyses on all types of interventions (due to variability in approach, context, and participants). The findings presented for most intervention types are from limited sources, and assessment of publication bias was not possible. These issues are not surprising, given the breadth of the field of occupational safety. To incorporate studies using serial measures, which provide the only source of information for some safety interventions such as legislation, we took a systematic, grounded approach to their review. Rather than requiring more stringent, specific criteria for inclusion of ITS studies, we chose to assess how investigators justified their approach to design and analyses, based on the context in which they were working. We sought to identify measures taken to improve external validity of studies, reasonable statistical inference, as well as an overall appropriate inferential process. We found the process useful and enlightening. Given the new approach, we may have failed to extract points others may find relevant. Similarly, to facilitate the broad nature of this review, we used a novel categorization of safety interventions, which is likely to evolve with additional use. The broad scope of this review and the time and resources available did not allow for contacting authors of original papers or seeking translation of non\u2010English manuscripts, resulting in a few cases where we did not have sufficient information that may have been possible to obtain from the authors. Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings Our synthesis of the relative effectiveness of workplace safety interventions is in accordance with the Public Health Hierarchy of Hazard Control. Specifically, more effective interventions eliminate risk at the source of the hazard through engineering solutions or the separation of workers from hazards; effects were greater when these control measures worked independently of worker \u201cdecision\u2010to\u2010use\u201d at the worksite. Interventions based on firm epidemiological evidence of causality and clear theoretical bases for the intervention approach were more effective in preventing injuries. Less effective behavioral approaches were often directed at the prevention of all workplace injuries through a common pathway, such as introducing safety training, without explicitly addressing specific hazards. We caution that this does not mean that training does not play an essential function in worker safety, but rather that it is not effective in the absence of other efforts. Due to the potential to reach large groups of workers through regulation and enforcement, these interventions with relatively modest effects, could have large population\u2010based effects.",

    "title": "The law, the researcher, and occupational health.",
    "abstract": "The primary role of law in society is to protect people, ensure a common good, settle disagreements, and persuade people to do the right thing. In the field of occupational health and safety (OHS), employees should be guaranteed a safe place to work by law, protecting them from occupational hazards, accidents, and disease. However, it is estimated that 2.3 million workers die annually for reasons attributed to work, mainly due to work-related diseases (1). As important as this number appears, it is likely to be a considerable underestimate of the true number of deaths due to shortcomings in the available data (2). This gap inevitably brings into question the effectiveness of OHS legislation, the process in which it is formulated, and the extent to which it is enforced. \n \nThe current issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health contains a systematic review by MacEachen and colleagues of the qualitative literature on OHS legislation and regulatory enforcement planning and implementation (3). This meta-ethnographic synthesis of 18 qualitative studies yielded four important themes pertaining to regulation formation, regulation challenges, inspector organization, and worker representation, and its findings will certainly reach a large audience among the OHS community. \nAlthough the review was conducted with explicit methodological standards, some caveats are worth mentioning. First, the evidence base of the review is limited to a few developed countries (with the notable exception of the Philippines) dominated by Australia and Canada where half of the studies were conducted. The way OHS is regulated in different nation states may vary to a certain extent (4), and, consequently, MacEachen et al\u2019s results should be interpreted according to one\u2019s own context. \n \nSecond, half of the studies were published between 1991\u20132009, before the financial crisis in the US sparked the global recession in the years 2008\u20132009. Two articles in the review linked weakened OHS legislation coverage to unions being constrained by economic conditions. It is plausible that the general economic decline observed in developed countries has amplified OHS regulation challenges, such as organizational restructuring, complex contracts, and psychosocial issues in the workplace. \nThird, the findings of the review remain essentially descriptive. They offer insights into policy-making and implementation challenges but stay cautiously away from political science theoretical frameworks, which could be advanced to discuss causal mechanisms linking policy and politics, for example. How to conceptualize the relationship between policy and politics is central to political science. The linkage between policy types (distributive, redistributive, regulatory) and sectors (housing, employment, labor, etc), on the one hand, and politics (forms and strategies of policy-making such as relabeling issues, agenda setting or policy coalitions), on the other hand, is characterized by complex relationships and a certain degree of conflict or consensus for which different theories have tried to account (5, 6). Such theoretical perspectives in political science are somehow missing in the synthesis of MacEachen and colleagues, either due to the content of the studies synthetized, the review process, or both. \n \nThe development of regulations and associated challenges described in the review fall within the realm of public policy analysis that seeks to explain how decision-makers, elected politicians, interest groups, lobbyists, experts, and political institutions produce public actions intended to have a large-scale impact. The study of public policy emerged in the 1960s at a time where optimism affected the social sciences and nurtured the belief that research could contribute to the success of public action. This overtly confident view was let down by the failure of many state-run programs, to the point that understanding policy failures has been described as intellectually stimulating albeit politically depressing (7). \n \nPublic policy evaluation faces theoretical, methodological, and political challenges. From a theoretical point of view, political science encompasses a variety of approaches, each one claiming to explain why policies differ between sectors and countries, and why some policies are stable and others change. Methodological challenges pertain to the difficulty in applying experimental approaches to expose the relationships between variables within a political system. Last but not least, political challenges are the limited culture of evaluation in politics and the scarcity of available data to perform evaluations. The lack of accuracy and comparability of statistical tools at the European Union and Member States level to monitor the progress of the European strategy on health and safety at work has been mentioned as a key challenge, in particular with regard to occupational diseases (8). \n \nAt first sight, some findings of the review could induce a defeatist view of the state\u2019s ability to address in a timely manner OHS issues associated with new forms of work in fast-evolving economies, such as outsourcing, temporary work, and international supply chains. In the current era of globalization where influential ideologies advocate for minimal state intervention in economic and social affairs, these findings are concerning. However, other findings open promising research avenues. The influence of the coordination and clarity of communication between parties on OHS should be further explored. The impact of the workers\u2019 representative involvement (experts with technical expertise or worksite-based workers with local legitimacy) should also be examined. The optimal degree of precision of OHS laws is still to be determined so that they can be followed and evaluated. The role of employers as policy recipients is largely ignored and the conditions that motivate them to participate in OHS systems should be studied. \n \nAbout a hundred years ago, the German sociologist Max Weber emphasized the radical difference between \u201cScience as a Vocation\u201d and \u201cPolitics as a Vocation\u201d (9). Researchers are definitely not supposed to paint the world according to their own views. For the worker\u2019s sake, let us hope they can help policy-makers develop laws to change it.",

    "title": "Police\u2010initiated diversion for youth to prevent future delinquent behavior: a systematic review",
    "abstract": "This Campbell systematic review examines the effects police\u2010initiated diversion programs on delinquent behavior, compared to traditional system processing. The review summarizes evidence from nineteen high\u2010quality studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials and six quasi\u2010experimental studies. This review includes studies that evaluated the effects of police\u2010led diversionary practices compared to traditional processing for youth under 18 years of age. We identified a total of 14 manuscripts representing 19 evaluations. Of these 19 evaluations, 13 used randomized controlled designs (random assignment to conditions) and 6 used quasi\u2010experimental designs (no random assignment to conditions). Many of these designs included two or more diversionary conditions compared to a common control (traditional processing) producing 31 treatment\u2010comparison contrasts for analysis. These studies were conducted between 1973 and 2011, inclusively. Most were conducted in the USA (11) with the remaining conducted in Canada (4), Australia (2), and the UK (2). The general pattern of evidence is positive, suggesting that police\u2010led diversion reduces the future delinquent behavior of low\u2010risk youth relative to traditional processing. Assuming a 50 percent reoffending rate for the traditional processing condition, the results suggest a reoffending rate of roughly 44 percent for the diverted youth. This overall benefit of diversion holds for the random assignment studies judged to be free from any obvious risks of bias. No meaningful differences were found across types of diversionary programs. Furthermore, we found no evidence to suggest these findings suffer from publication selection bias. Plain language summary Police\u2010led diversion of low\u2010risk youth reduces their future contact with the justice system Police\u2010led diversion of low\u2010risk youth who come into contact with the justice system is more effective in reducing a youth's future contact with the justice system compared to traditional processing. What is this review about? Youth misconduct and misbehavior is a normal part of adolescence and that misbehavior sometimes crosses the line from disruptive or problematic to delinquent. Nationally representative surveys of youth in the USA have indicated that minor delinquent behavior is normative, particularly for boys. The normative nature of minor delinquent behavior raises the question of how police should respond to minor delinquent behavior in a way that is corrective, but also avoids involving the youth in the criminal justice system beyond what will be effective in reducing future misbehavior. Police diversion schemes are a collection of strategies police can apply as an alternative to court processing of youth. Diversion as an option is popular among law enforcement officers, as it provides an option between ignoring youth engaged in minor wrongdoing and formally charging such youth with a crime. Police\u2010led diversion has the potential to reduce reoffending by limiting the exposure of low\u2010risk youth to potentially harmful effects of engagement with the criminal justice system. What is the aim of this review? This Campbell systematic review examines the effects police\u2010initiated diversion programs on delinquent behavior, compared to traditional system processing. The review summarizes evidence from nineteen high\u2010quality studies, including 13 randomized controlled trials and six quasi\u2010experimental studies. This review examined whether police\u2010led diversion and traditional processing of youth have different effects on rates of official delinquency. What are the main findings of this review? This review includes studies that evaluated the effects of police\u2010led diversionary practices compared to traditional processing for youth under 18 years of age. We identified a total of 14 manuscripts representing 19 evaluations. Of these 19 evaluations, 13 used randomized controlled designs (random assignment to conditions) and 6 used quasi\u2010experimental designs (no random assignment to conditions). Many of these designs included two or more diversionary conditions compared to a common control (traditional processing) producing 31 treatment\u2010comparison contrasts for analysis. These studies were conducted between 1973 and 2011, inclusively. Most were conducted in the USA (11) with the remaining conducted in Canada (4), Australia (2), and the UK (2). The general pattern of evidence is positive, suggesting that police\u2010led diversion reduces the future delinquent behavior of low\u2010risk youth relative to traditional processing. Assuming a 50 percent reoffending rate for the traditional processing condition, the results suggest a reoffending rate of roughly 44 percent for the diverted youth. This overall benefit of diversion holds for the random assignment studies judged to be free from any obvious risks of bias. No meaningful differences were found across types of diversionary programs. Furthermore, we found no evidence to suggest these findings suffer from publication selection bias. What do the findings of this review mean? The findings from this systematic review support the use of police\u2010led diversion for low\u2010risk youth with limited or no prior involvement with the juvenile justice system. Thus, police departments and policy\u2010makers should consider diversionary programs as part of the mix of solutions for addressing youth crime. Many of the studies included in the review were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Newer high quality studies are needed to ensure that the findings still hold for contemporary juvenile justice contexts. Additional studies are also needed outside of the USA for this same reason. Finally, we recommend that research explore the usefulness of diversion for low\u2010risk adult offenders. How up\u2010to\u2010date is this review? The search for eligible studies was completed in January of 2017, so only studies identifiable through January 2017 were included. This Campbell systematic review was published in May 2018. Executive summary/Abstract Background Overly punitive responses to youth misconduct may have the unintended consequence of increasing the likelihood of future delinquency; yet, overly lenient responses may fail to serve as a corrective for the misbehavior. Police diversion schemes are a collection of strategies police can apply as an alternative to court processing of youth. Police\u2010initiated diversion schemes aim to reduce reoffending by steering youth away from deeper penetration into the criminal justice system and by providing an alternative intervention that can help youth address psychosocial development or other needs that contribute to their problem behavior. Objectives The objective of this review was to synthesize the evidence on the effectiveness of pre\u2010court interventions involving police warning or counseling and release, and cautioning schemes in reducing delinquent behavior. Search methods A combination of 26 databases and websites were searched. References of relevant reviews were also scanned to identify studies. We also consulted with experts in the field. Searches were executed by two reviewers and conducted between August 2016 and January 2017. Selection criteria Only experimental and quasi\u2010experimental designs were eligible for this review. All quasi\u2010experimental designs must have had a comparison group similar to the police diversion intervention group with respect to demographic characteristics and prior involvement in delinquent behavior (i.e., at similar risk for future delinquent behavior). Additionally, studies must have included youth participants between 12 and 17 years of age who either underwent traditional system processing or were diverted from court processing through a police\u2010led diversion program. Studies were also eligible if delinquency\u2010related outcomes, including official and non\u2010official (self\u2010report or third\u2010party reporting) measures of delinquency were reported. Data collection and analysis This study used meta\u2010analysis to synthesize results across studies. This method involved systematic coding of study features and conversion of study findings into effect sizes reflecting the direction and magnitude of any police\u2010led diversion effect. There were 19 independent evaluations across the 14 primary documents coded for this review. From this, we coded 67 effect sizes of delinquent behavior post diversion across 31 diversion\u2010traditional processing comparisons. We analyzed these comparisons using two approaches. The first approach selected a single effect size per comparison based on a decision rule and the second used all 67 effect sizes, nesting these within comparison condition and evaluation design. Results The general pattern of evidence is positive, suggesting that police\u2010led diversion modestly reduces future delinquent behavior of low\u2010risk youth relative to traditional processing. Authors' conclusions The findings from this systematic review support the use of police\u2010led diversion for low\u2010risk youth with limited or no prior involvement with the juvenile justice system. Thus, police departments and policy\u2010makers should consider diversionary programs as part of the mix of solutions for addressing youth crime.",

    "title": "Alcohol Relapse After Early Liver Transplantation in Patients With Alcoholic Liver Disease: A Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant source of end-stage liver disease and liver failure and an indication for liver transplant (LT). Historically, LT for alcoholic liver disease (ALD) required 6 months of alcohol abstinence. Recently, it has been demonstrated that early LT (< 6 months of abstinence) in strictly selected group of patients provides survival benefit while keeping the relapse to harmful drinking at acceptable levels. This practice has been reflected in the Dallas consensus, but more data are needed to appropriately risk stratify the patient from the perspective of return to harmful alcohol drinking post-transplant. This \u201c6-month rule\u201d has been highly debated and recent data demonstrated that the duration of pre-transplant sobriety is not related with an increased risk of relapse to alcohol post-transplant. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the rate of alcohol relapse in individuals having standard vs. early LT. Methods MEDLINE and SCOPUS were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case-control studies from their inception through June 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMSA) 2009 checklist guidelines were followed for this meta-analysis. Studies comparing post-transplant outcomes, such as alcohol relapse, in individuals following standard vs. early LT, were included. Reviews, case studies, conference abstracts, clinical trials with only an abstract, and studies with inadequate data for extraction were all disqualified. The data were retrieved, gathered, and examined. The random effects model was used to generate forest plots. For the analysis, a P-value of 0.05 was considered significant. Results Thirty-four studies were discovered in the initial search. Three studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating 367 patients. Mean age was 51.7 years. Out of 367 patients, 173 (47%) underwent early LT. Out of three studies included, one study demonstrated decreased probability of alcohol relapse in patients undergoing early LT, whereas the other two showed the opposite result. All of the included studies were analyzed and had minimal risk of bias. Pooled analysis demonstrates that the difference in alcohol relapse between early vs. standard LT was insignificant (odds ratio: 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 0.75 - 2.06, P = 0.40). Conclusion Our results show that early LT is not associated with increased risk of alcohol relapse post-transplant when compared with a mandatory 6-month abstinence period. Hence, individuals with ALD should not be categorically rejected from LT merely on the criteria of 6 months of abstinence. Other selection criteria based on the need and post-transplant outcomes should be utilized.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective The objective of this study was to summarize existing knowledge on the association between driving under the influence of alcohol and road safety outcomes and to assess factors that may explain why these estimates vary. Methods Based on studies of the association between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels and crashes, we used multilevel metaregression to calculate summary effects of BAC level and analyze potential moderators of the association. Results Based on 60 studies and 393 effect estimates, we found that BAC level, outcome severity, use of hospital data, and geographical region contributed to heterogeneity in results. Conclusion The effect of BAC on crash and injury risk and culpability is stronger at higher BAC levels and for more serious outcomes. The relationship between BAC level and outcome is approximately exponential. The relationship is stronger in studies from Nordic countries than in studies from other countries, possibly because of the relatively low level of drunk driving in these countries. Studies based on hospital data and studies using non-crash-involved control groups find smaller effects on average.",

    "title": "The effects of cannabis and alcohol on driving performance and driver behaviour: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nCannabis and alcohol are frequently detected in fatal and injury motor vehicle crashes. While epidemiological meta-analyses of cannabis and alcohol have found associations with an increase in crash risk, convergent evidence from driving performance measures is insufficiently quantitatively characterized. Our objectives were to quantify the magnitude of the effect of cannabis and alcohol-alone and in combination-on driving performance and behaviour.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSystematic review and meta-analysis. We systematically searched Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus and TRID. Of the 616 studies that underwent full-text review, this meta-analysis represents 57 studies and 1725 participants. We extracted data for hazard response time, lateral position variability, lane deviations or excursions, time out of lane, driving speed, driving speed variability, speed violations, time speeding, headway, headway variability and crashes from experimental driving studies (i.e. driving simulator, closed-course, on-road) involving cannabis and/or alcohol administration. We reported meta-analyses of effect sizes using Hedges' g and r.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCannabis alone was associated with impaired lateral control [e.g. g\u2009=\u20090.331, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20090.212-0.451 for lateral position variability; g\u2009=\u20090.198, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.001-0.395 for lane excursions) and decreased driving speed (g\u2009=\u2009-0.176, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-0.298 to -0.053]. The combination of cannabis and alcohol was associated with greater driving performance decrements than either drug in isolation [e.g. g\u2009=\u20090.480, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.096-0.865 for lateral position variability (combination versus alcohol); g\u2009=\u20090.525, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.049-1.002 for time out of lane (versus alcohol); g\u2009=\u20090.336, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.036-0.636 for lateral position variability (combination versus cannabis; g\u2009=\u20090.475, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.002-0.949 for time out of lane (combination versus cannabis)]. Subgroup analyses indicated that the effects of cannabis on driving performance measures were similar to low blood alcohol concentrations. A scarcity of data and study heterogeneity limited the interpretation of some measures.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis meta-analysis indicates that cannabis, like alcohol, impairs driving, and the combination of the two drugs is more detrimental to driving performance than either in isolation.",

    "title": "The association between immune cells and breast cancer: insights from Mendelian randomization and meta\u2010analysis",
    "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women worldwide, with 2.3 million new cases and 685 000 deaths annually. It has the highest incidence in North America, Europe, and Australia and lower rates in parts of Asia and Africa. Risk factors include age, family history, hormone replacement therapy, obesity, alcohol consumption, and lack of physical activity. BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations significantly increase the risk. The 5-year survival rate is over 90% in developed countries but lower in developing ones. Early screening and diagnosis, using mammography and MRI, are crucial for reducing mortality. In recent years, significant progress has been made in studying BC immunophenotyping, particularly in multicolor flow cytometry, molecular imaging techniques, and tumor microenvironment analysis. These technologies improve diagnosis, classification, and detection of minimal residual disease. Novel immunotherapies targeting the tumor microenvironment, like CAR-T cell therapy, show high efficiency and fewer side effects. High levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes correlate with better prognosis, while immune checkpoint molecules (PD-1, PD-L1) help cancer cells evade the immune system. Tumor-associated macrophages promote invasion and metastasis. Blocking molecules like CTLA-4, LAG-3, and TIM-3 enhance antitumor responses, and cytokines like IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 aid tumor growth and immune evasion. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies use genetic variants to reduce confounding bias and avoid reverse causation, providing robust causal inferences about immune cell phenotypes and BC. This approach supports the development of precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies for BC. Methods: This study aims to conduct MR analysis on 731 immune cell phenotypes with BC in the BCAC and Finngen R10 datasets, followed by a meta-analysis of the primary results using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and multiple corrections for the significance P-values from the meta-analysis. Specifically, the study is divided into three parts: First, data on 731 immune cell phenotypes and BC are obtained and preprocessed from the GWAS Catalog and Open GWAS (BCAC) and the Finngen R10 databases. Second, MR analysis is performed on the 731 immune cell phenotypes with BC data from the BCAC and Finngen R10 databases, followed by a meta-analysis of the primary results using the IVW method, with multiple corrections for the significance P-values from the meta-analysis. Finally, the positively identified immune cell phenotypes are used as outcome variables, and BC as the exposure variable for reverse MR validation. Results: The study found that two immune phenotypes exhibited strong significant associations in MR analysis combined with meta-analysis and multiple corrections. For the immune phenotype CD3 on CD28+ CD4-CD8- T cells, the results were as follows: in the BCAC dataset, the IVW result was odds ratio (OR) = 0.942 (95% CI: 0.915\u20130.970, P=6.76\u00d710-5), \u03b2=\u22120.059; MR Egger result was \u03b2=\u22120.095; and the weighted median result was \u03b2=\u22120.060. In the Finngen R10 dataset, the IVW result was OR=0.956 (95% CI: 0.907\u20131.01, P=0.092), \u03b2=\u22120.045; MR Egger result was \u03b2=\u22120.070; and weighted median result was \u03b2=\u22120.035. The \u03b2 values were consistent in direction across all three MR methods in both datasets. The meta-analysis of the IVW results from both datasets showed OR=0.945 (95% CI: 0.922\u20130.970, P=1.70\u00d710-5). After Bonferroni correction, the significant P-value was P=0.01, confirming the immune phenotype as a protective factor against BC. For the immune phenotype HLA DR on CD33- HLA DR+, the results were as follows: in the BCAC dataset, the IVW result was OR=0.977 (95% CI: 0.964\u20130.990, P=7.64\u00d710-4), \u03b2=\u22120.023; MR Egger result was \u03b2=\u22120.016; and the weighted median result was \u03b2=\u22120.019. In the Finngen R10 dataset, the IVW result was OR=0.960 (95% CI: 0.938\u20130.983, P=6.51\u00d710-4), \u03b2=\u22120.041; MR Egger result was \u03b2=\u22120.064; and weighted median result was \u03b2=\u22120.058. The \u03b2 values were consistent in direction across all three MR methods in both datasets. The meta-analysis of the IVW results from both datasets showed OR=0.973 (95% CI: 0.961\u20130.984, P=3.80\u00d710-6). After Bonferroni correction, the significant P-value was P=0.003, confirming this immune phenotype as a protective factor against BC. When the immune cell phenotypes CD3 on CD28+ CD4-CD8- T cells and HLA DR on CD33- HLA DR+ were used as outcomes and BC was used as exposure, the data processing and analysis procedures were the same. The MR analysis results are as follows: data from the FinnGen database regarding the effect of positive immune phenotypes on malignant neoplasm of the breast indicated a \u03b2 coefficient of \u22120.011, OR = 0.99 (95% CI: \u22120.117\u20130.096, P=0.846); data from the BCAC database regarding favorable immune phenotypes for BC demonstrated a \u03b2 coefficient of \u22120.052, OR=0.095 (95% CI: \u22120.144\u20130.040, P=0.266). The results suggest insufficient evidence in both databases to indicate that BC inversely affects these two immune cell phenotypes. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that the immune cell phenotypes CD3 on CD28+ CD4-CD8- T cells and HLA DR on CD33- HLA DR+ protect against BC. This protective effect may be achieved through various mechanisms, including enhancing immune surveillance to recognize and eliminate tumor cells; secreting cytokines to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and growth directly; triggering apoptotic pathways in tumor cells to reduce their number; modulating the tumor microenvironment to make it unfavorable for tumor growth and spread; activating other immune cells to boost the overall immune response; and inhibiting angiogenesis to reduce the tumor\u2019s nutrient supply. These mechanisms work together to help protect BC patients and slow disease progression. Both immune cell phenotypes are protective factors for BC patients and can be targeted to enhance their function and related pathways for BC treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nSobriety checkpoints are an effective strategy to reduce alcohol-impaired driving, motor vehicle crashes, injuries, and fatalities. The aim of this study was to identify the geographic extent over which individual sobriety checkpoints affect alcohol-impaired driving.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS\nSpatial ecological panel analysis using geolocated breath test data from the Queensland Police Service, Australia, for January 2012 to June 2018. Data were aggregated over 338 weeks within 528 Statistical Area level 2 (SA2) units (n=178,464 SA2-weeks) and 84 Statistical Area level 3 (SA3) units (n=28,392 SA3-weeks). SA2 units in Queensland contain a mean population of 8,883.5 (standard deviation (SD)=5,5018,3) and encompass 468.9 roadway kilometers (SD=1,490.0); SA3 units contain a mean population of 57,201.6 (SD=29,521.6) and encompass 2,936.0 roadway kilometers (SD=7,025.0).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nIndependent measures were the density of sobriety checkpoints conducted per 500 roadway kilometers within local and spatially adjacent space-time units. The dependent measure was the rate of tests that detected breath alcohol concentration (a proxy for Blood Alcohol Concentration [BAC]) greater than the legal maximum value of 0.05% for fully licensed drivers in Queensland. Bayesian hierarchical spatial negative binomial models related sobriety checkpoints to the rate of breath tests with BAC\u22650.05% within and between space-time units.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nOne additional sobriety checkpoint conducted per 500 roadway kilometers was associated with 2.5% reduction in the rate of breath tests with BAC\u22650.05% within local SA2 units (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.975; 95% credibility interval (CrI): 0.973, 0.978), and with 5.5% reduction in the rate of breath tests with BAC\u22650.05% within local SA3 units (IRR=0.945; 95%CrI: 0.937, 0.953). Associations were attenuated towards null in spatially adjacent units and in temporally lagged units (e.g., SA3-weeks; adjacent lagged 1 week: IRR=0.969; 95%CrI: 0.937, 1.003).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIndividual sobriety checkpoints appear to be associated with reductions in nearby alcohol-impaired driving. Relationships decay after approximately 1 week and beyond local areas containing approximately 60,000 residents and 3,000 kilometers of roadway.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nSobriety checkpoints have strong empirical and theoretical support as an intervention to reduce alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes. The purpose of this study was to examine whether checkpoint size (the number of police officers) and checkpoint duration (the amount of time in operation) affect associations between individual checkpoints and subsequent alcohol-related crash incidence.\n\n\nMETHOD\nQueensland Police Service provided latitude-longitude coordinates and date and time data for all breath tests that occurred in Brisbane, Australia, from January 2012 to June 2018. We applied hierarchical cluster analysis to the latitude-longitude coordinates for breath tests, identifying checkpoints as clusters of \u2265 25 breath tests conducted by \u2265 3 breath testing devices over a duration of 3 to 8 hours. Generalized linear autoregressive moving average (GLARMA) models related counts of alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes to the number of checkpoints conducted per week, as well as 1 week prior and 2 weeks prior.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 3,420 alcohol-related crashes occurred and 2,069 checkpoints were conducted in Brisbane over the 6.5-year (339-week) study period. On average, checkpoints included a mean of 266.0 breath tests (SD=216.3), 16.4 devices (SD=13.7), and were 286.3 minutes duration (SD=104.2). Each 10 additional checkpoints were associated with a 12% decrease in crash incidence at a lag of 1 week (IRR=0.88; 95%CI: 0.80,0.97). We detected no differential associations according to checkpoint size or duration.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSobriety checkpoints are associated with fewer alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes for around 1 week. Checkpoint size and duration do not appear to affect this relationship.",

    "title": "Differential impacts of ridesharing on alcohol-related crashes by socioeconomic municipalities: rate of technology adoption matters",
    "abstract": "An emergent group of studies have examined the extent under which ridesharing may decrease alcohol-related crashes in countries such as United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, and Chile. Virtually all existent studies have assumed that ridesharing is equally distributed across socioeconomic groups, potentially masking differences across them. We contribute to this literature by studying how socioeconomic status at the municipal level impacts Uber\u2019s effect on alcohol-related crashes. We use data provided by Chile\u2019s Road Safety Commission considering all alcohol-related crashes, and fatal and severe alcohol-related injuries that occurred between January 2013 and September 2013 (before Uber) and January and September 2014 (with Uber) in Santiago. We first apply spatial autocorrelation techniques to examine the level of spatial dependence between the location of alcohol-related crashes with and without Uber. We then apply random-effects meta-analysis to obtain risk ratios of alcohol-related crashes by considering socioeconomic municipality differences before and after the introduction of Uber. In both analyses, we find that the first 9 months of Uber in Santiago is associated with significant rate ratio decreases (RR\u2009=\u20090.71 [95% Confidence Interval (C.I.) 0.56, 0.89]) in high socioeconomic municipalities in all alcohol-related crashes and null (RR\u2009=\u20091.10 [95% C.I. 0.97, 1.23]) increases in low socioeconomic municipalities. No concomitant associations were observed in fatal alcohol-related crashes regardless of the socioeconomic municipality group. One interpretation for the decline in alcohol-related crashes in high socioeconomic municipalities is that Uber may be a substitute form of transport for those individuals who have access to credit cards, and thus, could afford to pay for this service at the time they have consumed alcohol. Slight increases of alcohol-related crashes in low socioeconomic municipalities should be studied further since this could be related to different phenomena such as increases in alcohol sales and consumption, less access to the provision of public transport services in these jurisdictions, or biases in police reports.",

    "title": "Effects of ethyl alcohol on injuries severity according to injury severity scales in pedestrian fatal injury in traffic crashes",
    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: The dominant cause of injuries in traffic crashes. A significant portion of them affects victims under the influence of ethyl alcohol. The goal of the studies was to assess the correlation between the state of sobriety and the severity of injuries expressed by injury severity scales in fatal pedestrian victims of traffic crashes. Research Material and Method: The data were obtained from the Warsaw Medical University's Department of Forensic Medicine. The analysis covered the data for 2009\u20132013 and included 200 fatal pedestrian victims hit by passenger cars. The assessment of the effect of risk factors on injury severity expressed in terms of injury severity scales such as Life Threat Indicator (LTI), International Classification based Injury Severity Score (ICISS), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and New Injury Severity Score (NISS), was made using adequately selected methods of statistical analysis. Results: As alcohol concentration increases in women, the values of LTI, ICISS-10 and ICISS-15 decrease, which denotes more severe injuries. In the ISS and NISS, the effect of alcohol concentration on the severity of injuries turned out to be negligible. However, these injuries are significantly heavier in women than in men. According to all the scales used, the older the victims, the milder injuries cause their death. Conclusions: The studies show that ethyl alcohol concentration may harm injury severity, especially in the case of women. The assessment of the severity of injuries in traffic crash victims is significantly influenced by their age and gender. The more risk factors the scale takes into consideration, the more precise is the assessment.",

    "abstract": "ISSUES\nWe conducted a systematic review to examine whether smoking bans alone are effective in achieving smoking cessation in people released from prison, and patients discharged from mental health or substance use settings.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nWe searched health, criminology and social science databases. Detailed search strings were used to combine terms related to smoking bans and cessation interventions in prison, mental health and substance use treatment settings. We used backward and forward snowballing and manual hand searching to find additional studies. Studies were included if they: were published between 1 January 2000 and 25 February 2022; included a complete smoking ban; measured people released from prison and/or mental health and/or substance use patients smoking post-release/discharge from a smoke-free facility; and reported smoking cessation intervention and/or smoking ban outcomes. Methodological quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project's Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies and reviewed by two authors.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nPeople released from prison, mental health and substance use in-patients who experience a smoking ban while incarcerated or in in-patient settings often relapse to smoking shortly after release or discharge. We found that although smoking bans alone do not promote cessation, multi-component interventions in combination with smoking bans can significantly increase cessation rates post-release/discharge provided they support participants during this time.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere is limited evidence to suggest tobacco bans alone in prison, mental health and substance use treatment settings are effective in achieving long-term smoking cessation. This review suggests that combining smoking bans and cessation interventions including pre- and post-release/discharge support can be effective in achieving smoking cessation.",

Six studies were deemed good- or fair-quality. Of these six, three provided feedback to clinicians only, one to clients only, and two to both clients and clinicians. Only one of the six found feedback was associated with significant reductions in substance use and only among off-track clients.

    "abstract": "Background Psychosocial approaches are the first-line treatments for cocaine dependence, although they still present high dropout and relapse rates. Thus, there is a pressing need to understand which variables influence treatment outcomes to improve current treatments and prevent dropout and relapse rates. The aim of this study is to explore predictors of treatment retention and abstinence in CUD. Methods This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched three databases\u2014PubMed, PsychINFO and Web of Science\u2014for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published in English and Spanish from database inception through April 1, 2023. We selected all studies that met the inclusion criteria (adults aged\u2009\u2265\u200918, outpatient treatment, CUD as main addiction, and no severe mental illness) to obtain data for the narrative synthesis addressing cocaine abstinence and treatment retention as main outcome variables. After data extraction was completed, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB-2). Results A total of 566 studies were screened, and, of those, 32 RCTs were included in the synthesis. Younger age, more years of cocaine use, and craving levels were significant predictors of relapse and treatment dropout. Fewer withdrawal symptoms, greater baseline abstinence, greater treatment engagement, and more self-efficacy were all predictors of longer duration of abstinence. The role of impulsivity as a predictor of CUD is unclear due to conflicting data, although the evidence generally suggests that higher impulsivity scores can predict more severe addiction and withdrawal symptoms, and earlier discontinuation of treatment. Conclusion Current evidence indicates which variables have a direct influence on treatment outcomes, including well-studied cocaine use-related variables. However, additional variables, such as genetic markers, appear to have a high impact on treatment outcomes and need further study.

Systematic reviews have focused on specific disorders or treatment modalities and have not targeted this age group in particular.

During a four-step screening process, 17,359 articles were assessed, among which 114 met the inclusion criteria. Most included studies involved patients with mood, eating, or substance use disorders. Age, gender, and ethnicity were the most frequently reported predictors. For age and gender the findings were mixed, so it is not possible to state which age group or gender would benefit most from treatment across disorder groups. Ethnic minority status and history of traumatic events may predict poorer outcomes. However, the results mainly did not support the relevance of sociodemographic variables for predicting treatment outcome.",

    "abstract": "ISSUES\nConsideration of an individual's quality of life (QoL) can benefit assessment and treatment of addictive disorders, however, uncertainty remains over operationalisation of the construct as an outcome and the appropriateness of existing measures for these populations. This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate QoL and health-related QoL outcome instruments used in addiction-related risk and harm research and map their conceptualised domains.\n\n\nAPPROACH\nThree electronic databases and a specialised assessment library were searched on 1 February 2022 for QoL or health-related QoL outcome instruments used with addiction-related risk and harm populations. PRISMA reporting guidance was followed and included outcome instruments were appraised using mixed methods. Psychometric evidence supporting their use was summarised. The COSMIN risk of bias tool was used to assess validation studies.\n\n\nKEY FINDINGS\nA total of 298 articles (330 studies) used 53 outcome instruments and 41 unique domains of QoL. Eleven instruments' psychometric properties were evaluated. No instrument was assessed for any parameter in at least five studies for meta-analytic pooling. Cronbach's alpha (\u03b1) internal consistency was the most widely assessed parameter with the AQoLS, WHOQOL-BREF, ALQoL-9, Q-LES-Q-SF, SF-12, DUQoL, QLI and SF-36 displaying promising statistics (\u03b1\u2009>\u20090.70).\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION\nMany instruments have been utilised. However, a significant proportion of studies applied a small number of instruments with minimal high-quality validation evidence supporting their use within addiction-related risk and harm. Promising instruments are recommended, however, the paucity of supporting evidence limits confidence in the reliability and validity of QoL measurement in these populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Issues Cessation of methamphetamine use may result in a characteristic withdrawal syndrome, no medication has been approved for this indication. This systematic review aims to assess the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine withdrawal, the first comprehensive meta\u2010analysis since 2008. Approach MEDLINE (1966\u20132020), CINAHL (1982\u20132020), PsychINFO (1806\u20132020) and EMBASE (1947\u20132020) were systematically searched. Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating pharmacological treatments for methamphetamine withdrawal, reviewing outcomes of treatment discontinuation, mental health outcomes, withdrawal symptoms (including craving) and patient safety. The relative risk (RR) and weighted mean difference (MD) were used to meta\u2010analyse dichotomous and continuous data respectively, with 95% confidence intervals. Risk of bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessments were conducted. Key Findings Nine RCTs of six medications (n = 242 participants) met inclusion criteria, however, only six trials of four medications (n = 186) could be meta\u2010analysed. Mean sample size across studies was 27 participants, and 88% of participants were male. The quality of evidence in this review varies from low to very low on GRADE assessments. Amineptine may reduce discontinuation rates (RR 0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07, 0.72, p = 0.01), and improve global state (MD \u22120.49, 95% CI \u22120.80, \u22120.17), compared with placebo, however, this medication is no longer approved. No other medications improved any domain when compared with placebo. Due to lack of reporting safety profiles could not be established. Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to indicate any medication is effective for the treatment of methamphetamine withdrawal. The poor quality of the evidence indicates a need for better powered, high\u2010quality trials.",

Beyond their metabolic benefits, GLP-1 RAs exhibit neuroprotective and psychotropic effects, potentially benefiting mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. This systematic review aims to synthesize existing evidence on the effects of GLP-1 RAs on mental health outcomes, including both potential therapeutic benefits across various psychiatric disorders and the risk of associated adverse mental health effects. This systematic review was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria encompassed human and animal studies examining the impact of GLP-1 RAs on mental health. Data from 81 selected studies were extracted and analyzed, focusing on mental health outcomes and reported adverse effects. GLP-1 RAs exhibit potential beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and reduced risk of suicidal ideation in animal and human models through antioxidative, anti-inflammatory mechanisms, and modulation of neurotransmitter pathways. Additionally, GLP-1 RAs were effective in reducing alcohol and substance use and binge eating behaviors. Adverse psychiatric effects associated with GLP-1 RAs, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, are noted in pharmacovigilance analyses, with variations among different GLP-1 RAs. GLP-1 RAs hold promise for addressing psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, alcohol and substance use disorders. Despite their potential benefits, the risk of psychiatric adverse effects requires cautious administration.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy of psychological interventions in promoting smoking cessation among individuals who are currently incarcerated. We systematically searched four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Embase) studies assessing the effectiveness of psychological interventions on smoking cessation. Two meta-analyses were conducted: (1) abstinence rates between psychological interventions and control groups in Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), and (2) a pooled analysis of abstinence rates after psychological intervention across follow-up periods. Meta-regression was used to examine the effect of follow-up duration on abstinence. 11 studies (N\u2009=\u20092688), including seven RCTs, met the inclusion criteria.

    "title": "Interventions to reduce harms related to drug use among people who experience incarceration: systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Mortality, suicide, self-harm, and substance use are elevated among people who are incarcerated. There is a wide range of heterogeneous interventions aimed at reducing these harms in this population. Previous reviews have focused on specific interventions or limited their findings to drug use and recidivism and have not explored interventions delivered after release from prison. Our aim is to examine the effect of interventions delivered to people who use drugs during incarceration or after release from incarceration, on a wide range of outcomes. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases up until Sept 12, 2023 for studies published from Jan 1, 1980 onwards. All studies evaluating the effectiveness of any intervention on drug use, recidivism outcomes, sexual or injecting risk behaviours, or mortality among people who use psychoactive drugs and who were currently or recently incarcerated were included. Studies without a comparator or measuring only alcohol use were excluded. Data extracted from each study included demographic characteristics, interventions, and comparisons. Pooled odds ratios and risk ratios were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses. We identified 126 eligible studies (47 randomised controlled trials and 79 observational studies) encompassing 18 interventions; receiving opioid-agonist treatment (OAT) in prison reduced the risk of death in prison (one study; hazard ratio 0\u00b725; 95% CI 0\u00b713-0\u00b748), whereas receiving OAT in the first 4 weeks following release reduced risk of death in the community (two studies; relative risk 0\u00b724; 95% CI 0\u00b715-0\u00b737). Therapeutic community interventions reduced re-arrest at 6-12 months (six studies; odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b772; 95% CI 0\u00b755-0\u00b795) and reincarceration at 24 months (two studies; OR 0\u00b766; 95% CI 0\u00b748-0\u00b796). There was scarce evidence that OAT and syringe service provision are effective in reducing injecting risk behaviours and needle and syringe sharing. There are effective interventions to reduce mortality and recidivism for people who use drugs who have been incarcerated. Nonetheless, there are also substantial gaps in the research examining the effect of interventions on risk behaviours and mortality during incarceration and a need for randomised designs examining outcomes for people who use drugs after release.

    "title": "Motivational interviewing for substance use reduction.",
    "abstract": "Substance use is a global issue, with around 30 to 35 million individuals estimated to have a substance-use disorder. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a client-centred method that aims to strengthen a person's motivation and commitment to a specific goal by exploring their reasons for change and resolving ambivalence, in an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion. This review updates the 2011 version by Smedslund and colleagues. To assess the effectiveness of motivational interviewing for substance use on the extent of substance use, readiness to change, and retention in treatment. We searched 18 electronic databases, six websites, four mailing lists, and the reference lists of included studies and reviews. The last search dates were in February 2021 and November 2022. We included randomised controlled trials with individuals using drugs, alcohol, or both. Interventions were MI or motivational enhancement therapy (MET), delivered individually and face to face. Eligible control interventions were no intervention, treatment as usual, assessment and feedback, or other active intervention. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. We conducted meta-analyses for the three outcomes (extent of substance use, readiness to change, retention in treatment) at four time points (post-intervention, short-, medium-, and long-term follow-up). We included 93 studies with 22,776 participants. MI was delivered in one to nine sessions. Session durations varied, from as little as 10 minutes to as long as 148 minutes per session, across included studies. Study settings included inpatient and outpatient clinics, universities, army recruitment centres, veterans' health centres, and prisons. We judged 69 studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain and 24 studies to be at low or unclear risk. Comparing MI to no intervention revealed a small to moderate effect of MI in substance use post-intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.89; I Motivational interviewing may reduce substance use compared with no intervention up to a short follow-up period. MI probably reduces substance use slightly compared with assessment and feedback over medium- and long-term periods. MI may make little to no difference to substance use compared to treatment as usual and another active intervention. It is unclear if MI has an effect on readiness to change and retention in treatment. The studies included in this review were heterogeneous in many respects, including the characteristics of participants, substance(s) used, and interventions. Given the widespread use of MI and the many studies examining MI, it is very important that counsellors adhere to and report quality conditions so that only studies in which the intervention implemented was actually MI are included in evidence syntheses and systematic reviews. Overall, we have moderate to no confidence in the evidence, which forces us to be careful about our conclusions. Consequently, future studies are likely to change the findings and conclusions of this review.",

    "title": "Global patterns of opioid use and dependence: harms to populations, interventions, and future action.",
    "abstract": "We summarise the evidence for medicinal uses of opioids, harms related to the extramedical use of, and dependence on, these drugs, and a wide range of interventions used to address these harms. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study estimated that in 2017, 40\u00b75 million people were dependent on opioids (95% uncertainty interval 34\u00b73-47\u00b79 million) and 109\u2008500 people (105\u2008800-113\u2008600) died from opioid overdose. Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) can be highly effective in reducing illicit opioid use and improving multiple health and social outcomes-eg, by reducing overall mortality and key causes of death, including overdose, suicide, HIV, hepatitis C virus, and other injuries. Mathematical modelling suggests that scaling up the use of OAT and retaining people in treatment, including in prison, could avert a median of 7\u00b77% of deaths in Kentucky, 10\u00b77% in Kiev, and 25\u00b79% in Tehran over 20 years (compared with no OAT), with the greater effects in Tehran and Kiev being due to reductions in HIV mortality, given the higher prevalence of HIV among people who inject drugs in those settings. Other interventions have varied evidence for effectiveness and patient acceptability, and typically affect a narrower set of outcomes than OAT does. Other effective interventions focus on preventing harm related to opioids. Despite strong evidence for the effectiveness of a range of interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of people who are dependent on opioids, coverage is low, even in high-income countries. Treatment quality might be less than desirable, and considerable harm might be caused to individuals, society, and the economy by the criminalisation of extramedical opioid use and dependence. Alternative policy frameworks are recommended that adopt an approach based on human rights and public health, do not make drug use a criminal behaviour, and seek to reduce drug-related harm at the population level.",

    "title": "Systematic Review of Factors Influencing Smoking Following Release From Smoke-Free Prisons.",
    "abstract": "Given the current proliferation of prison smoke-free policies internationally, and the multiple benefits of continued smoking abstinence for correctional populations, improved understanding of factors influencing postrelease smoking abstinence is required to inform support strategies aimed at individuals exiting smoke-free prisons. We systematically searched health, social science, and criminal justice databases for studies relating to smoking behaviors among people released from smoke-free prisons. Studies were included if: they were published between January 1, 2000 and July 26, 2017; they were published in English; the population was people who were incarcerated or formerly incarcerated in prisons with total smoke-free policies; and the reported outcomes included measures of: (1) prerelease intention to smoke or remain abstinent from smoking following release, (2) smoking relapse or abstinence following release, or (3) quit attempts following postrelease smoking relapse. Both authors independently screened returned citations to assess eligibility and reviewed studies for methodological quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project's Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. Fifteen of 121 publications were included. The evidence base in this area is small, almost exclusively US-based, and is mostly methodologically weak. Interventions delivered both pre and postrelease, that strengthen intention to quit, integrate with other substance-use treatment, and facilitate social support for quitting may help maintain postrelease smoking abstinence. There is an urgent need for high-quality research to inform interventions to reduce high smoking relapse rates upon release from smoke-free prisons, to extend the multiple benefits of continued smoking abstinence into the community. Interventions designed to help people remain abstinent from tobacco following release from smoke-free prisons are an important opportunity to improve the health, finances, and well-being of this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "To systematically review the quantitative and qualitative evidence base pertaining to the prevalence, practice of, and treatment response to the diversion of prescribed opiates in the prison setting. Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, ASSIA and Science Direct databases were searched for papers from 1995 to the present relevant to the abuse of prescribed opiate medication. Identified journals and their reference lists were hand searched for other relevant articles. Of the abstracts identified as relevant, full text papers were retrieved and critiqued against the inclusion criteria for the review. Three hundred and fifty-five abstracts were identified, leading to 42 full-text articles being retrieved. Of those, 10 papers were included in the review. Significant differences in abuse behaviours between different countries were reported. However, a key theme emerged from the data regarding a culture of nasal administration of prescribed sublingual buprenorphine within some prisons due to both reduced prevalence of injection within prison and reduced supplies of illicit drugs within prison. The buprenorphine/naloxone preparation appears to be less amenable to abuse. The review highlighted a paucity of empirical research pertaining to both prevalence of the phenomenon and treatment responses. Healthcare providers within prisons need to prescribe opioids in the least abuseable preparation since the risk of abuse is significant, despite widespread processes of supervised dispensing. Prescription medication abuse is not limited to opioids and the predominant drug of abuse in an individual prison can rapidly change according to availability.",

    "title": "Prisoners co-infected with tuberculosis and HIV: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Almost from the beginning of the HIV epidemic in 1981, an association with tuberculosis (TB) was recognized. This association between HIV and TB co-infection has been particularly evident amongst prisoners. However, despite this, few studies of TB in prisons have stratified results by HIV status. Given the high prevalence of HIV-positive persons and TB-infected persons in prisons and the documented risk of TB in those infected with HIV, it is of interest to determine how co-infection varies amongst prison populations worldwide. For this reason we have undertaken a systematic review of studies of co-infected prisoners to determine the incidence and/or prevalence of HIV/TB co-infection in prisons, as well as outcomes in this group, measured as treatment success or death. A literature search was undertaken using the online databases PubMed, Embase, IBSS, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health and CINAHL Plus. No restrictions were set on language or publication date for article retrieval, with articles included if indexed up to 18 October 2015. A total of 1975 non-duplicate papers were identified. For treatment and outcome data all eligible papers were appraised for inclusion; for incidence/prevalence estimates papers published prior to 2000 were excluded from full text review. After full text appraisal, 46 papers were selected for inclusion in the review, 41 for incidence/prevalence estimates and nine for outcomes data, with four papers providing evidence for both outcomes and prevalence/incidence. Very few studies estimated the incidence of TB in HIV positive prisoners, with most simply reporting prevalence of co-infection. Co-infection is rarely explicitly measured, with studies simply reporting HIV status in prisoners with TB, or a cross-sectional survey of TB prevalence amongst prisoners with HIV. Estimates of co-infection prevalence ranged from 2.4 to 73.1% and relative risks for one, given the other, ranged from 2.0 to 10.75, although some studies reported no significant association between HIV and TB. Few studies provided a comparison with the risk of co-infection in the general population. Prisoners infected with HIV are at high risk of developing TB. However, the magnitude of risk varies between different prisons and countries. There is little evidence on treatment outcomes in co-infected prisoners, and the existing evidence is conflicting in regards to HIV status influence on prisoner treatment outcomes.PROSPERO Number: CRD42016034068.",

Results Almost half of the juvenile offenders had psychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorder (19.17%), bipolar disorder (18.33%), antisocial personality disorder (11.67%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (10.83%). Alcohol use disorder was significantly associated with repeated offenses, but psychiatric disorders, excluding alcohol use disorder, were not significantly associated with repeated offenses. Conclusion These results suggested that the development of education and treatment programs for psychiatric disorders, including alcohol use disorder, among juvenile offenders on probation or parole may help to prevent repeated criminal behaviour.",

    "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment: Problems and Solutions.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) afflicts over 29 million individuals and causes more than 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. A heuristic framework for AUD includes a three-stage cycle-binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation-that provides a starting point for exploring the heterogeneity of AUD with regard to treatment. Effective behavioral health treatments and US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications are available but greatly underutilized, creating a major treatment gap. This review outlines challenges that face the alcohol field in closing this treatment gap and offers solutions, including broadening end points for the approval of medications for the treatment of AUD; increasing the uptake of screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment; addressing stigma; implementing a heuristic definition of recovery; engaging early treatment; and educating health-care professionals and the public about challenges that are associated with alcohol misuse. Additionally, this review focuses on broadening potential targets for the development of medications for AUD by utilizing the three-stage heuristic model of addiction that outlines domains of dysfunction in AUD and the mediating neurobiology of AUD.",

    "title": "Gut-Liver-Brain Axis and Alcohol Use Disorder: Treatment Potential of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE Chronic alcohol use is a major cause of liver damage and death. In the United States, multiple factors have led to low utilization of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD), including lack of provider knowledge and comfort in prescribing medications for AUD. Alcohol consumption has direct effects on the gut microbiota, altering the diversity of bacteria and leading to bacterial overgrowth. Growing evidence suggests that alcohol\u2019s effects on the gut microbiome may contribute to increased alcohol consumption and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). This article reviews human and preclinical studies investigating the role of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in ameliorating alcohol-associated alterations to the liver, gut, and brain resulting in altered behavior; it also discusses the therapeutic potential of FMT. SEARCH METHODS For this narrative review, a literature search was conducted in September 2022 of PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar to identify studies published between January 2012 and September 2022. Search terms used included \u201cfecal microbiota transplantation\u201d and \u201calcohol.\u201d SEARCH RESULTS Most results of the literature search were review articles or articles on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; these were excluded. Of the remaining empirical manuscripts, very few described clinical or preclinical studies that were directly investigating the effects of FMT on alcohol drinking or related behaviors. Ultimately, 16 studies were included in the review. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The literature search identified only a few studies that were directly investigating the effect of FMT on ALD or alcohol drinking and related behaviors. Largely proof-of-concept studies, these findings demonstrate that alcohol can alter the gut microbiome and that the microbiome can be transferred between humans and rodents to alter affective behaviors frequently associated with increased alcohol use. Other studies have shown promise of FMT or other probiotic supplementation in alleviating some of the symptoms associated with ALD and drinking. These results show that the implementation of FMT as a therapeutic approach is still in the investigatory stages.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims To address the question of tailored baclofen prescribing in alcohol use disorder (AUD) in relation to dose-dependent efficacy and the potential danger of high doses and to provide suggestions for the use of high doses of baclofen in the treatment of AUD. The context is the approvement in France of baclofen in the treatment of AUD without dose limitation, making French physicians, who usually prescribe baclofen in a tailored manner, often use high or very high doses. Methods A narrative review of the results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that used tailored baclofen prescribing and of the severe adverse effects of baclofen that have been reported in the literature. Results The results show that RCTs using tailored doses of baclofen in AUD are not completely demonstrative, though they are encouraging according to certain meta-analyses, while observational studies that used tailored doses constantly show a good effectiveness of baclofen treatment. The results suggest that many severe adverse effects of baclofen could be related to a nonrespect by physicians of prescription rules and appropriate treatment monitoring. Conclusions The use of tailored doses shows that the dose required to suppress cravings is highly variable, low or high, depending on each case. Analysis of the circumstances in which severe adverse effects occur suggest that a careful monitoring of baclofen prescribing might prevent a large majority of severe adverse effects. We propose that the education of the patients and the prescription skills, seriousness, and availability of the prescribing physicians are of major importance in the managing of tailored baclofen treatment of AUD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEffective interventions to improve patient outcomes in comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) remain a clinical unmet need. While the choice of abstinence is the cornerstone for the prevention of disease progression and mortality, evidence suggests a suboptimal engagement with treatment supporting recovery. This qualitative investigation aims to understand barriers and facilitators to treatment as experienced by this clinical population by applying a multidimensional adherence model proposed by the World Health Organization.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-four participants with comorbid AUD and ARLD were recruited from an inpatient clinical setting. Data for this study were collected through semistructured, in-depth interviews. Deductive analysis was organized by the Framework method, and theory-driven themes were identified according to the multidimensional adherence model. This included factors across the social and economic, patient, condition, treatment, and healthcare system levels.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe findings in this study indicate systematic challenges in maintaining continuity between primary, secondary, and community care. Aspects related to social and economic context, treatment, and healthcare systems were found to hinder engagement. Identified facilitators to engagement included the participatory role of family, shared lived experience of addiction/recovery, and therapeutic alliance with healthcare providers.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe understanding of these barriers and facilitators from a service user's perspective can bridge the treatment gap for this clinical population. This can provide an opportunity for the implementation of effective interventions and inform the development of policies promoting accessible care. Government and public health bodies have fundamental roles in shifting treatment paradigms in comorbid AUD\u00a0and ARLD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe use of telehealth treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD) has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear which patients are using telehealth and how telehealth visits are associated with treatment duration. This study examined characteristics associated with telehealth use among Veterans Health Administration\u00a0patients receiving AUD treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a national retrospective\u00a0cohort study, we examined data from March 01, 2020 to February 28, 2021 to: First, identify patient characteristics associated with (a) any telehealth versus only in-person care for AUD treatment, and (b) video (\u22651 video visit) versus only telephone visits for AUD treatment (\u22651 telephone visit, no video) among any telehealth users. This analysis used mixed-effects logistic regression models to adjust for potential correlation across patients treated at the same facility. Second, we assessed whether visit modality was associated with the amount of AUD treatment received (number of AUD psychotherapy visits or medication coverage days). This analysis used mixed-effects negative binomial regression models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong 138,619 patients who received AUD treatment, 52.8% had \u22651 video visit, 38.1% had \u22651 telephone but no video visits, and 9.1% had only in-person visits. In the regression analyses, patients who were male or had an opioid or stimulant use disorder (compared to having no non-AUD substance use disorder) were less likely to receive any telehealth-delivered AUD treatment compared to only in-person AUD treatment. Among patients who received any telehealth-delivered AUD treatment, those who were \u226545\u2009years old (compared to 18-29\u2009years old), Black (compared to White), diagnosed with a cannabis or stimulant use disorder, or diagnosed with a serious mental illness were less likely to receive a video visit than only telephone visits. Receiving any AUD telehealth was associated with receiving more psychotherapy visits and medication coverage days than only in-person care.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTelehealth, a common modality for AUD treatment, supported a greater number of psychotherapy visits and a longer duration of medication treatment for AUD. However, some groups were less likely to receive any video telehealth than telephone visits, suggesting that multiple treatment modalities should remain available to ensure treatment access.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) offers a promising treatment avenue to modulate brain function in alcohol use disorder (AUD). To the best of our knowledge, this pilot study is the first randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial to deliver intermittent theta burst stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) among US veterans with AUD. We hypothesized that 20 sessions of real TMS are tolerable and feasible. As a secondary line of inquiry, we hypothesized that, relative to sham TMS, individuals receiving real TMS would experience greater reductions in 6-month relapse rates, anhedonia, and alcohol cue-reactivity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nVeterans (n\u2009=\u200917, one woman) were enrolled in a double-blind, sham-controlled trial (2-3 sessions/day; 7-10\u2009days; 600 pulses/session; 20 sessions). Pre- and posttreatment assessments included responses to self-report questionnaires and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of alcohol cue-reactivity. Alcohol consumption was assessed for 6\u2009months. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to predict posttreatment craving, mood, and cue-reactivity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIndividuals who received active iTBS (n\u2009=\u20098) were less likely to relapse within 3\u2009months after treatment than the sham-treated group (n\u2009=\u20099) (OR\u2009=\u200912.0). Greater reductions in anhedonia were observed following active iTBS (Cohen's d\u2009=\u2009-0.59), relative to sham (d\u2009=\u2009-0.25). Alcohol cue-reactivity was reduced following active iTBS and increased following sham within the left insula (d\u2009=\u2009-0.19 vs. 0.51), left thalamus (d\u2009=\u2009-0.28 vs. 0.77), right insula (d\u2009=\u20090.18 vs. 0.52), and right thalamus (d\u2009=\u2009-0.06 vs. 0.62).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRelative to sham, we demonstrate that 20 sessions of real left DLPFC iTBS reduced the likelihood of relapse for at least 3\u2009months. The potential utility of this approach is underscored by observed decreases in anhedonia and alcohol cue-reactivity-strong predictors of relapse among veterans. These initial data offer a valuable set of effect sizes to inform future clinical trials in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nEffective interventions for the management of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) remain a gap in clinical practice, and patients' engagement with alcohol services is suboptimal. Based upon the principles of operant conditioning, contingency management (CM) is a psychosocial intervention th at involves gradual, increasing incentives upon completion of treatment-related goals such as treatment attendance.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA pilot feasibility trial was conducted with 30 adult patients recruited from an inpatient clinical setting. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit patients presenting comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and ARLD. Participants were randomized to integrated liver care (ILC), receiving hepatology and AUD care, or ILC with a voucher-based CM intervention (intervention arm). A longitudinal qualitative approach was adopted to explore anticipated (Stage 1) and experienced acceptability (Stage 2). The Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) guided semi-structured in-depth interviews and deductive analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThirty participants were enrolled in the pilot trial, and interviews were conducted with 24 participants at Stage 1 and seven at Stage 2. Over half of the cohort (54.2%, n\u2009=\u200913) presented decompensated liver disease, and an average of 179\u2009units of alcohol were consumed per week. Overall positive views toward voucher-based CM were noted, and explanatory data emerged across five TFA domains (intervention coherence, ethicality, self-efficacy, perceived effectiveness, and affective attitude). The core aspects of the voucher-based CM intervention matched participants' preferences and needs. Participants regarded CM as having a symbolic value and strengthening the therapeutic alliance with healthcare providers.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe data support the scope of voucher-based CM intervention to promote engagement with treatment services, and its potential to address the gaps in the care continuum in ARLD. The findings are of practical significance for developing person-centered, tailored interventions for this clinical population. The outcomes of this investigation can inform decision-making among stakeholders and healthcare providers and improve health outcomes for this clinical population.",

    "abstract": "Treatment resistance in alcohol use disorders (AUD) is a major problem for affected individuals and for society. In the search of new treatment options, few case studies using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens have indicated positive effects in AUD. Here we report a double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing active DBS (\u201cDBS-EARLY ON\u201d) against sham stimulation (\u201cDBS-LATE ON\u201d) over 6 months in n \u2009=\u200912 AUD inpatients. This 6-month blind phase was followed by a 12-month unblinded period in which all patients received active DBS. Continuous abstinence (primary outcome), alcohol use, alcohol craving, depressiveness, anxiety, anhedonia and quality of life served as outcome parameters. The primary intention-to-treat analysis, comparing continuous abstinence between treatment groups, did not yield statistically significant results, most likely due to the restricted number of participants. In light of the resulting limited statistical power, there is the question of whether DBS effects on secondary outcomes can nonetheless be interpreted as indicative of an therapeutic effect. Analyses of secondary outcomes provide evidence for this, demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of abstinent days, lower alcohol craving and anhedonia in the DBS-EARLY ON group 6 months after randomization. Exploratory responder analyses indicated that patients with high baseline alcohol craving, depressiveness and anhedonia responded to DBS. The results of this first randomized controlled trial are suggestive of beneficial effects of DBS in treatment-resistant AUD and encourage a replication in larger samples.",

    "title": "Alcohol use disorder treatment via video conferencing compared with in-person therapy during COVID-19 social distancing : A non-inferiority comparison of three cohorts.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nSocial distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic forced an abrupt transformation of treatment delivery for mental health care. In mid-March 2020, nearly all in-person contact was replaced with video conferencing. The pandemic thus offered a natural experiment and a unique opportunity to conduct an observational study of whether alcohol use disorder treatment through video conferencing is non-inferior to in-person treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIn a large urban substance use disorder treatment center in the Netherlands, treatment evaluation is routine practice. Outcome data are regularly collected to support shared decision making and monitor patient progress. For this study, pre-test and post-test data on alcohol use (Measurements in the Addictions for Triage and Evaluation), psychopathology (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales), and quality of life (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life) were used to compare outcomes of cognitive behavioral therapy treatment for three cohorts: patients who received treatment for a primary alcohol use disorder performed prior to (n\u2009=\u2009628), partially during (n\u2009=\u2009557), and entirely during (n\u2009=\u2009653) the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOutcome was similar across the three cohorts: No inferior outcomes were found for treatments that were conducted predominantly through video conferencing during lockdown or treatments that started in-person, but were continued through video conferencing, compared to in-person treatments that were conducted prior to COVID-19. The number of drop-outs were also similar between cohorts. However, there was a difference in average treatment intensity between cohorts, with treatment partially or fully conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic lasting longer.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nTreatment for a primary alcohol use disorder, provided partially or predominantly through video conferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in abstinence rates and secondary outcomes similar to traditional in-person care, in spite of the potentially negative effects of the COVID-related lockdown measures themselves. These results from everyday clinical practice corroborate findings of randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses in which video conferencing appeared non-inferior to in-person care in clinical effectiveness.",

    "title": "Patient Perspective on the Role of Substance-Free Activities during Alcohol Use Disorder Treatment: A Mixed-Method Study",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Behavioral economic theory of addiction proposes that substance use often takes place in environments with limited substance-free reinforcement. While increasing substance-free reinforcement is known to reduce substance use, systematic efforts to boost substance-free reinforcement is not often a focus of most alcohol treatment programs. Participants (N\u2009=\u200921) with alcohol use disorder participated in virtual focus group sessions. Qualitative content analysis was conducted on participants\u2019 verbatim responses. Substance-free activities were also assessed with a 66-item modified pleasant activity list specifying activity engagement frequency and enjoyment. All participants reported introduction to substance-free activity engagement as part of their treatment, although those in group therapy (relative to individual) reported less consistent support. While motives for initial activity engagement were reported as stemming from external sources (i.e., therapist), activity maintenance was linked to intrinsic motives (i.e., personal interest). All participants identified substance-free activities as a key aid to successful recovery. Types of most helpful activities were ones related to self-care, social connections, acts of service, and creative outlets. Findings are consistent with theories of behavior change and suggest participants believe substance-free activity engagement is an important component of their recovery, however they are not receiving consistent support during the pivotal early recovery period.",

    "abstract": "As states work to develop better drug policy that promotes public health and safety while reducing incarceration, there is a need for behavioral health research on community-based sanctions like probation and parole. This paper uses a national U.S. health data set to contribute to the knowledge base on substance use and criminal justice supervision. Using the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2015 to 2021, we examine sociodemographic, behavioral, and mental health correlates of alcohol and drug treatment for those on probation and parole. Among those on probation and parole, 15\u00a0% received past-year alcohol treatment and 16\u00a0% received drug treatment while only 8-11\u00a0% met criteria for a past-year substance use disorder. Being African American was associated with half the likelihood of receiving drug treatment compared to being White for those on probation and parole as well as for those not. Otherwise, all correlates had either weaker relationships or no relationship at all to treatment receipt for those on probation and parole. This population tends to be male, low-income, disproportionately people of color, and have complex service needs with poor health outcomes. Further research and theory development are needed to understand the mismatch between substance use disorder and treatment receipt for this population and to address racial disparities in treatment.",

    "abstract": "The policy landscape around substance use has changed dramatically in the past decade, which may have affected the number and characteristics of treatment episodes for substance use disorder (SUD). In this study, we examine changes in the volume of SUD treatment referrals from the legal system and compare changes in the composition of substances used by referral source. We used publicly available discharge data on specialty SUD treatment episodes in the U.S. from 2015-2019 and included episodes involving adults that are discharged from specialty SUD treatment facilities during the study. We calculated descriptive statistics of specialty SUD treatment discharges in each year and aggregated across all years by referral source and substance(s) reported upon admission. To test differences by year and referral source, we conducted z-tests of proportions. The proportion of referrals to specialty SUD treatment from the legal system declined between 2015 and 2019 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, referrals from probation/parole and diversionary programs grew over time (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in number and proportion over time. Legal referrals were most often associated with alcohol or cannabis use, though referrals for these substances declined from 2015-2019. This research lays the groundwork for future investigations to evaluate the effect of important policy changes on referral sources to specialty SUD treatment and the quality and outcomes associated with referrals to treatment from the legal system.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic produced system-level changes within the criminal legal system and community-based substance use disorder (SUD) treatment system with impacts on recovery efforts. This study examines rural and urban clinicians' perspectives of COVID-19 on SUD treatment delivery for people on community supervision. Virtual qualitative interviews were conducted between April and October 2020 with 25 community supervision clinicians employed by Kentucky's Department of Corrections (DOC), who conduct assessments and facilitate community-based treatment linkages for individuals on probation or parole. Transcripts were analyzed in NVivo using directed content analysis methods. Clinicians were predominantly white (92%) and female (88%) with an average of over 9 years working in the SUD treatment field and 4.6 years in their current job. Four COVID-19 themes were identified by both rural and urban clinicians including: (1) telehealth increases the modes of communication, but (2) also creates paperwork and technological challenges, (3) telehealth requires more effort for inter/intra-agency collaboration, and (4) it limits client information (e.g., no urine drug screens). Two additional rural-specific themes emerged related to COVID-19: (5) increasing telehealth options removes SUD treatment transportation barriers and (6) requires flexibility with programmatic requirements for rural clients. Findings indicate the need for community-based SUD treatment providers approved or contracted by DOC to support and train clients to access technology and improve information-sharing with community supervision officers. A positive lesson learned from COVID-19 transitions was a reduction in costly travel for rural clients, allowing for greater engagement and treatment adherence. Telehealth should continue to be included within the SUD continuum of care, especially to promote equitable services for individuals from rural areas.",

    "title": "Barriers and facilitators to the use of medication for opioid use disorder within the criminal justice system: Perspectives from clinicians.",
    "abstract": "This study examines social service clinicians' (SSCs) perspectives of factors within the criminal justice system that impact justice-involved individuals' use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Opioid use disorder (OUD) rates are high among justice-involved individuals, and overdose risk is heightened upon release from incarceration. This study is innovative, as it specifically focuses on criminal justice contexts that influence the MOUD continuum of care from the perspective of clinicians working within the criminal justice system. Understanding criminal justice-related facilitators and barriers to MOUD treatment will guide tailored policy intervention to increase MOUD use and promote recovery and remission among justice-involved individuals. The study completed qualitative interviews with 25 SSCs who are employed by a state department of corrections to provide assessment and referrals to substance use treatment to individuals on community supervision. The study used NVivo software to code the major themes found within each transcribed interview; two research assistants participated in consensus coding to ensure consistency in coding across transcripts. This study focused on the secondary codes that fell under the \"Criminal Justice System\" primary code, as well as codes that indicated barriers and facilitators to MOUD treatment. SSCs cited sentencing time credits as structural facilitators of MOUD treatment; clients sought more information about extended-release naltrexone since time off of their sentence was available if initiated. Support for extended-release naltrexone by officers and judges was often mentioned as an attitudinal facilitator of initiation. Poor intra-agency collaboration among department of corrections agents was an institutional barrier to MOUD. Also, probation and parole officers' stigma surrounding other types of MOUD, specifically buprenorphine and methadone, was an attitudinal barrier to MOUD within the criminal justice system. Future research should examine the effect that time credits have on extended-release naltrexone initiation, considering the wide consensus among SSCs that their clients were motivated to initiate this type of MOUD because of the resulting time off their sentences. Stigma among probation and parole officers and lack of communication within the criminal justice system need to be addressed so that more individuals with OUD may be exposed to life-saving treatments.",

    "title": "Using Social Media to Engage Justice-Involved Young Adults in Digital Health Interventions for Substance Use: Pilot Feasibility Survey Study.",
    "abstract": "Young adults involved in the justice system have high rates of substance use disorders and low rates of treatment engagement. Most justice-involved young adults are supervised in the community-not incarcerated in jail or prison-where they have ongoing access to substances and experience significant barriers to care. When they do engage in treatment, they tend to have worse outcomes than justice-involved adolescents and older adults. Despite the need to develop targeted treatments, there are unique challenges in recruiting this population into clinical research. Digital health technology offers many novel avenues for recruiting justice-involved young adults into clinical research studies and disseminating substance use disorder treatments to justice-involved young adults. Because the vast majority of young adults regularly use one or more social media platforms, social media may offer a cost-effective and efficient way to achieve these goals. This study aimed to describe the process and feasibility of using social media platforms (Facebook and Reddit) to recruit justice-involved young adults into clinical research. Justice-involved young adults recruited from these platforms completed a survey assessing the acceptability of digital health interventions to address substance use in this population. Justice-involved young adults (aged 18-24 years) were recruited through paid advertisements placed on Facebook and Reddit. Participants responded to a web-based survey focused on their substance use, treatment use history, and acceptability of various digital health interventions focused on substance use. A national sample of justice-involved young adults were successfully enrolled and completed the survey (N=131). Participants were racially diverse (8/131, 6.1% American Indian individuals; 27/131, 20.6% Asian individuals; 23/131, 17.6% Black individuals; 26/131, 19.8% Latinx individuals; 8/131, 6.1% Pacific Islander individuals; 49/131, 37.4% White individuals; and 2/131, 1.5% individuals who identified as \"other\" race and ethnicity). Advertisements were cost-effective (US $0.66 per click on Facebook and US $0.47 per click on Reddit). More than half (72/131, 54.9%) of the participants were on probation or parole in the past year and reported hazardous alcohol (54/131, 51.9%) or drug (66/131, 57.4%) use. Most of the participants (103/131, 78.6%) were not currently participating in substance use treatment. Nearly two-third (82/131, 62.6%) of the participants were willing to participate in one or more hypothetical digital health interventions. Social media is a feasible and cost-effective method for reaching justice-involved young adults to participate in substance use research trials. With limited budgets, researchers can reach a broad audience, many of whom could benefit from treatment but are not currently engaged in care. Proposed digital health interventions focusing on reducing substance use, such as private Facebook groups, SMS text message-based appointment reminders, and coaching, had high acceptability. Future work will build on these findings to develop substance use treatment interventions for this population.",

    "abstract": "Criminal legal system (CLS) exposed adults experience higher rates of substance use, substance use disorder (SUD), and overdose. As most CLS exposed adults are not incarcerated, it is important to focus on CLS exposure across the carceral continuum. This research used pooled data from adult respondents (N\u00a0=\u00a0206,314) in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2019). Survey weighted descriptive statistics and Poisson regression were used to estimate prevalence of polysubstance use (i.e., concurrent use) across CLS exposure types (i.e., arrest, probation, parole), identifying relevant correlates. The prevalence of polysubstance use was higher among CLS exposed adults, and nearly two-thirds of CLS exposed adults who used multiple types of substances indicated having an SUD. Comparing CLS exposure types, polysubstance use was less likely among adults on probation (IRR=0.89, 95%CI=0.84,0.94) or parole (IRR=0.82, 95%CI=0.76,0.87) compared to those arrested. Polysubstance use was also more likely among adults on probation (IRR=1.09, 95%CI =1.01,1.17) compared to those on parole. While some characteristics (i.e., age, ethnicity, SUD) were consistently associated with polysubstance use across types of CLS exposure, other characteristics (i.e., sexual identity, marital status, suicidal ideation) were not. There is heterogeneity in health risks as a function of CLS exposure type. Further research is needed to identify causal mechanisms and differences based on demographic characteristics. Given high levels of polysubstance use across CLS exposure types, a shift towards a more comprehensive approach in substance use epidemiology may facilitate building an evidence-base to maximize treatment related interventions to reduce polysubstance-involved overdoses.",

    "title": "Structural and organizational factors shaping access to medication treatment for opioid use disorder in community supervision.",
    "abstract": "Four million individuals in the U.S. criminal-legal system are supervised in the community under probation or parole. Sentences to community supervision often mandate participation in substance use treatment. Yet evidence-based treatment with medication (i.e., methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) is rarely offered to people under community supervision with opioid use disorder (OUD). This qualitative study explores the structural and organizational factors shaping OUD medication treatment use in community supervision. We conducted in-depth interviews with 31 community supervision professionals. Thematic analysis characterized interview participants' perceptions of the key factors shaping use of OUD medications in community supervision. Findings indicate that authorities making decisions about OUD treatment include community supervision agencies, treatment providers, judges and courts, and jails and prisons. Agencies with more rehabilitative cultural orientations are more forgiving of relapse and supportive of OUD medications. Punishment/enforcement orientations align with an emphasis on surveillance and drug testing, which can inhibit medication treatment and interrupt continuity of care. Community supervision agencies generally reported deference to the recommendations of substance use treatment providers regarding the details of treatment, including the use of medication. Given that most treatment providers do not offer OUD medication, community supervision agencies must develop a sophisticated understanding of the various services offered by local treatment providers to tailor referrals accordingly, a responsibility for which they may be inadequately trained. Efforts to improve engagement with medication treatment in U.S. community supervision settings could have a significant impact on reincarceration, morbidity, and mortality among individuals with OUD under supervision.",

    "title": "Suggestibility and confabulation among individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder: A review for criminal justice, forensic mental health, and legal interviewers.",
    "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are conditions arising from prenatal alcohol exposure which results in a range of neurodevelopmental deficits in areas including cognition, memory, language, executive functioning, emotional regulation, and adaptive functioning. Deficits in various neurodevelopmental areas can range from mild to severe, depending on many factors including the quantity and timing of alcohol exposure during the prenatal development period. During interviews in criminal justice, forensic mental health, and legal contexts (e.g., criminal investigations, cross examination, victim interviews, interviews for lawsuits, forensic evaluations, pre-sentence investigations), deficits associated with FASD may elevate the risk of suggestibility and confabulation. These issues can result in negative jurisprudence-related outcomes, including impulsive Miranda rights waivers, incorrect assumptions of competency, inaccurate or incomplete information gathering, misinterpretation of intent, witness reliability issues, court ordered treatment completion problems, probation and parole violations, false confessions, and false accusations. The aim of the present article is to explain the context in which these issues can arise and provide criminal justice, forensic mental health, and legal professionals with key guidelines that can assist in minimizing suggestibility and confabulation when interviewing persons with FASD. We hope that the suggestions and strategies presented in this article will reduce potential obstructions of justice and enhance the quality of information obtained from individuals impacted by FASD. A brief discussion is also provided to identify additional research and training opportunities needed to clarify \"best practices\" for professionals tasked with evaluating the challenges facing this unique population.",

    "title": "Clinician identified barriers to treatment for individuals in Appalachia with opioid use disorder following release from prison: a social ecological approach.",
    "abstract": "The non-medical use of opioids has reached epidemic levels nationwide, and rural areas have been particularly affected by increasing rates of overdose mortality as well as increases in the prison population. Individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) are at increased risk for relapse and overdose upon reentry to the community due to decreased tolerance during incarceration. It is crucial to identify barriers to substance use disorder treatment post-release from prison because treatment can be particularly difficult to access in resource-limited rural Appalachia. A social ecological framework was utilized to examine barriers to community-based substance use treatment among individuals with OUD in Appalachian Kentucky following release from prison. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 15 social service clinicians (SSCs) employed by the Department of Corrections were conducted to identify barriers at the individual, interpersonal, organizational/institutional level, community, and systems levels. Two independent coders conducted line-by-line coding to identify key themes. Treatment barriers were identified across the social ecological spectrum. At the individual-level, SSCs highlighted high-risk drug use and a lack of motivation. At the interpersonal level, homogenous social networks (i.e., homophilious drug-using networks) and networks with limited treatment knowledge inhibited treatment. SSC's high case load and probation/parole officer's limited understanding of treatment were organizational/institutional barriers. Easy access to opioids, few treatment resources, and a lack of community support for treatment were barriers at the community level. SSC's noted system-level barriers such as lack of transportation options, cost, and uncertainty about the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. More rural infrastructure resources as well as additional education for family networks, corrections staff, and the community at large in Appalachia are needed to address barriers to OUD treatment. Future research should examine barriers from the perspective of other key stakeholders (e.g., clients, families of clients) and test interventions to increase access to OUD treatment.",

Women in the justice system experience high rates of drug use, victimization, trauma symptoms, and other health problems and would appear to be at high risk for nonmedical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD). This study will be among the first to describe prevalence and correlates of NMUPD among this population. This cross-sectional study collected data from 406 victimized women on probation and parole between 2010 and 2012. In a multiple logistic regression model, we differentiated women who reported past-year NMUPD from those who did not using demographic, health, other drug use, substance use treatment, and trauma symptom severity variables. Past-year NMUPD was reported by 26.8% (n = 109) of the overall sample. Women reporting NMUPD were significantly younger and more likely to be white. Past-year use of alcohol (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-6.1), marijuana (AOR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.8-7.0), methamphetamines (AOR: 6.1; 95% CI: 1.7-21.3), and heroin (AOR: 8.4; 95% CI: 2.0-35.2) were significantly associated with NMUPD. Additionally, each unit increase in the measure assessing bodily pain was associated with a 40% increase (AOR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-1.7) in the odds of NMUPD. Finally, meeting diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder almost doubled (AOR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1-3.4) the odds of reporting past-year NMUPD. Victimized women on probation and parole report high rates of NMUPD, and this behavior intersects with other complex social, behavioral, psychological, and physical needs. The authors recommend increased access to trauma-informed correctional care among women in the justice system.",

Although BPD might be common among prison inmates, little is known about prevalence and psychiatric comorbidity in probationers and parolees. In 2013, a consecutive sample of 109 newly admitted adult male offenders on probation or parole in all three probation offices of Stockholm, Sweden, completed self-report screening questionnaires for BPD and other psychiatric morbidity. Participants scoring over BPD cut-off participated in a psychiatric diagnostic interview. We ascertained a final DSM-5 BPD prevalence rate of 19.8% (95% CI: 12.3-27.3%). The most common current comorbid disorders among subjects with BPD were antisocial personality disorder (91%), major depressive disorder (82%), substance dependence (73%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (70%), and alcohol dependence (64%). Individuals diagnosed with BPD had significantly more current psychiatric comorbidity (M=6.2 disorders) than interviewed participants not fulfilling BPD criteria (M=3.6). Participants with BPD also reported substantially more symptoms of ADHD, anxiety and depression compared to all subjects without BPD. BPD affected one fifth of probationers and was related to serious mental ill-health known to affect recidivism risk. The findings suggest further study of possible benefits of improved identification and treatment of BPD in offender populations.",

    "abstract": "Extended-released naltrexone (XR-NTX) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication associated with higher rates of abstinence, reduced cravings, and delayed relapse to use. However, there is a dearth of literature on real-world implementation of XR-NTX. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, in collaboration with UCLA Integrated Substance Abuse Programs, developed a demonstration project to increase access to XR-NTX. This article describes that project, along with data on the expansion of XR-NTX service delivery and patient uptake. A secondary descriptive data analysis of demographics, substance use history, current substance use behaviors, health-related variables, and dosing records was conducted on 609 patients who received XR-NTX from Los Angeles County substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities from April 2010 through July 2013. A geographic information system approach mapped the distribution of XR-NTX-referring agencies across Los Angeles County. Of the 609 records analyzed, a majority of patients (64%) obtained more than 1 dose of XR-NTX. Most XR-NTX patients reported alcohol use disorder (71.9%; n = 438). Compared with the general Los Angeles County substance use disorder patients, XR-NTX recipients reported more severe substance use histories. Finally, XR-NTX was accessed by providers in 6 of the 8 Service Planning Areas of Los Angeles County. These findings reflect a higher XR-NTX cessation rate and a lower average number of doses, in contrast to similar demonstration projects in community settings with patients on parole or probation. However, this study shows that it is feasible to engage treatment providers in the use XR-NTX among their patients with alcohol or opioid use disorders. Several implications for future research and implementation are discussed.",

    "title": "Bidirectional prospective associations between behavioral economic indicators and drinking patterns during alcohol use disorder natural recovery attempts.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nBehavioral economic (BE) theory posits that harmful alcohol use is a joint product of elevated alcohol demand and preference for immediate over delayed rewards. Despite cross-sectional research support, whether expected bidirectional relations exist between BE indicators and drinking during recovery attempts is unknown. Therefore, this prospective research investigated quarter-by-quarter cross-lagged associations between BE simulation tasks and drinking following a natural recovery attempt. Higher demand and discounting in a given quarter should predict subsequent drinking. Conversely, drinking in a given quarter should predict subsequent higher demand and discounting.\n\n\nMETHOD\nCommunity-dwelling problem drinkers were enrolled shortly after stopping heavy drinking without treatment (N = 191). Drinking practices, problems, delay discounting, and alcohol demand (intensity, Omax, Pmax, elasticity) were assessed at baseline and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Longitudinal cross-lagged models related each BE indicator in the previous quarter to drinking status in the next quarter, and vice versa.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHigher demand intensity (consumption when drinks are free) at Quarter 1 distinguished participants who drank heavily in Quarter 2 from those who abstained. In turn, heavy drinking participants in Quarter 2 had higher intensity at Quarter 3 than abstainers and moderate drinkers in Quarter 2, and higher intensity at Quarter 3 distinguished heavy drinkers in Quarter 4 from moderate drinkers (ps < .05). Hypothesized associations for other BE indices were inconsistent or partially supported.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol purchase task metrics showed some hypothesized prospective associations with drinking during a natural recovery attempt, which supports their ecological validity as relapse risk indicators.

Acute and chronic alcohol consumption cause epigenetic modifications in these systems, which underlie changes in gene expression and subsequently, the emergence of pathophysiological phenotypes associated with AUD. One such epigenetic mechanism is methylation, which can occur on DNA, histones, and RNA. Methylation relies on one carbon metabolism to generate methyl groups, which can then be transferred to acceptor substrates. While DNA methylation of particular genes generally represses transcription, methylation of histones and RNA can have bidirectional effects on gene expression. This review summarizes one carbon metabolism and the mechanisms behind methylation of DNA, histones, and RNA. We discuss the field\u2019s findings regarding alcohol\u2019s global and gene-specific effects on methylation in the brain and liver and the resulting phenotypes characteristic of AUD.",

The sample included 107 veterans who were randomized to receive either Concurrent Treatment of PTSD and Substance Use Disorder Using Prolonged Exposure (COPE; an exposure-based trauma focused treatment) or Seeking Safety (SS; a present-focused coping skills-based treatment) and completed measures of PTSD and alcohol use at every other session. Multilevel models estimated the prospective associations between PTSD and alcohol use during treatment. Results indicated that greater PTSD symptom severity was associated with greater future alcohol use (b = 0.20, p = .024), and greater alcohol use was associated with greater future PTSD symptom severity (b = 0.13, p = .003). The effect size for PTSD symptoms to future alcohol use was larger than the reciprocal relationship. When using lagged PTSD severity to predict future drinking, results revealed that clinically significant differences in PTSD severity levels were associated with comparably large differences in drinking. Treatment condition did not moderate the effect of PTSD symptom severity on alcohol use (or the reciprocal relationship). Findings lend support to the mutual maintenance model of addiction. Integrated treatments that treat both PTSD and alcohol use may be preferential to sequential model of care where individuals are expected to achieve abstinence or reduced use prior to receiving trauma-focused treatment.

    "title": "Therapeutic Interventions of Gut-Brain Axis as Novel Strategies for Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder Associated Cognitive and Mood Dysfunction",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUD) is characterized by persistent or intermittent alcohol cravings and compulsive drinking. The functional changes in the central nervous system (CNS) after alcohol consumption are alcohol-associated cognitive impairment and mood disorders, which are major health issues reported in AUDs. Studies have shown that transferring the intestinal microbiota from AUDs patients to germ-free animals causes learning and memory dysfunction, depression and anxiety-like behavior, indicating the vital role of intestinal microbiota in development of neuropsychiatric disorders in AUD. Intestinal flora composition of AUD patients are significantly different from normal people, suggesting that intestinal flora imbalance orchestrate the development of neuropsychiatric disorders in AUD. Studies suggests that gut microbiome links bidirectional signaling network of the enteric nervous system (ENS) to central nervous system (CNS), forming gut-microbe-brain axis (brain-gut axis). In this review, we discussed pathogenesis and possible treatment of AUD-induced cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depression disorders. Further, we described the mechanism of intestinal flora imbalance and dysfunction of hippocampus-amygdala-frontal cortex (gut-limbic circuit system dysfunction). Therefore, we postulate therapeutic interventions of gut-brain axis as novel strategies for treatment of AUD-induced neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "title": "The association between alcohol consumption and pain interference in a nationally representative sample: The moderating roles of gender and alcohol use disorder symptomatology.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPrior research on alcohol consumption and pain has yielded inconsistent results regarding the directionality of effects for both consumption-to-pain and pain-to-consumption relations. The present study sought to examine directionality of these relations by testing bidirectional longitudinal associations between consumption and pain interference, a crucial aspect of pain that captures pain-related disability and has been regarded as a valuable measure of treatment outcome. In addition, this study explored possible moderation of these bidirectional longitudinal associations by gender and alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptomatology.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAnalyses included 29,989 current/former drinkers who were interviewed at both waves (2001 and 2004) of the U.S. National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Analyses used self-report data from both waves on past-year average daily volume of alcohol consumed and past-month pain interference (one item from the Medical Outcomes Study 12-item Short-Form Health Survey [MOS-SF-12]). AUDADIS-IV data from Wave 1 were used to index baseline AUD symptomatology (i.e., symptom count). Cross-lagged panel modeling and multigroup analyses were employed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRegarding the consumption-to-pain-interference relation, in general, higher baseline alcohol consumption was associated with lower subsequent pain interference at follow-up. However, among men with higher AUD symptom counts, the opposite pattern emerged, with higher baseline alcohol consumption being significantly related to higher subsequent pain interference at follow-up. Regarding the pain-interference-to-consumption relation, higher baseline pain interference was significantly associated with lower subsequent alcohol consumption at follow-up, and no moderating effects were observed.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe distinctive patterns of the consumption-to-pain-interference relation observed among men with elevated AUD symptomatology suggest that this relation might be driven by different mechanisms across different groups of individuals. Specifically, the detrimental effect of alcohol on pain interference might emerge at relatively advanced stages of AUD among men, consistent with Koob's Dark Side of Alcohol Addiction theory in human research.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nRecovery from alcohol use disorder (AUD) is often narrowly defined by abstinence from alcohol and improvements in functioning (e.g. mental health, social functioning, employment). This study used latent profile analysis to examine variability in recovery outcomes, defined by alcohol use, alcohol-related problems and psychosocial functioning at 3\u00a0years following treatment. Secondary analysis investigated pre-treatment, post-treatment and 1- and 3-year post-treatment covariate predictors of the latent profiles.\n\n\nDESIGN\nSecondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nUnited States.\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS\nWe used data from the out-patient arm of Project MATCH (n\u00a0=\u00a0806; 29.7% female, 22.2% non-white).\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nRecovery was defined by latent profile analyses including measures of psychosocial functioning and life satisfaction (Psychosocial Functioning Inventory), unemployment and mental health (Addiction Severity Index), alcohol and other drug use (Form 90) and alcohol-related consequences (Drinker Inventory of Consequences) 3 years following treatment. Mixture modeling was used to examine correlates of profiles.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nWe identified four profiles at 3\u00a0years following treatment: (1) poor functioning frequent heavy drinkers, (2) poor functioning infrequent heavy drinkers, (3) high functioning occasional heavy drinkers and (4) high-functioning infrequent non-heavy drinkers. There were relatively few differences on indicators of functioning and treatment-related variables between the high functioning infrequent non-heavy drinkers and the high-functioning occasional heavy drinkers, other than high-functioning occasional heavy drinkers having lower alcohol dependence severity [odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.90, 0.98], fewer post-treatment coping skills (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.54, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.32, 0.90) and lower 3-year post-treatment abstinence self-efficacy (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.37, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.28, 0.49) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) involvement (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.87, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.85, 0.99). The two high-functioning profiles showed the greatest improvements in functioning from baseline through the 3-year follow-up, whereas the low-functioning profiles showed the least amount of improvement. High-functioning occasional heavy drinkers had higher purpose in life than the poor-functioning profiles.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSome individuals who engage in heavy drinking following treatment for alcohol use disorder may function as well as those who are mostly abstinent with respect to psychosocial functioning, employment, life satisfaction and mental health.",

    "title": "Testing Phenotypic Models of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder Comorbidity Using Longitudinal Registry Data.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nTwo predominate phenotypic models of causality exist to explain the high co-occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD): the self-medication and susceptibility models. Population-based longitudinal studies that simultaneously examine both models are needed. Thus, the goal of the present study is to test these models using the Swedish National Registries.\n\n\nMETHOD\nRegistires were used to conduct longitudinal Cox proportional hazard models (N~1.5 million) and cross-lagged panel models (N~3.8 million) with follow-up periods of ~23 years.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCovarying for cohort and socioeconomic status, Cox proportional hazards model results found strong support for the self-medication model. Results showed that PTSD predicted increased risk for AUD among both men (HR=4.58 [4.42-4.74]) and women (HR=4.14 [3.99-4.30]), significantly moreso for men (interaction HR=1.11 [1.05-1.16]). Support was also found for the susceptibility model, although the effects were lower in magnitude than those for the self-medication model. AUD increased risk for PTSD among men (HR=2.53 [2.47-2.60]) and women (HR=2.06 [2.01-2.12]), and signifantly moreso for men (interaction term HR=1.23 [1.18-1.28]). Cross-lagged model results of simultaneously testing both models found support for bidirectionality. The PTSD\u2192AUD paths and the AUD\u2192PTSD paths were of modest effect for males and females.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results from both complimentary statistical approaches demonstrate that the models of comorbidity are not mutually exclusive. While the Cox model results evidenced more support for the self-medication pathway, the cross-lagged model results suggest the prospective relationships between these disorders are nuanced across development.",

This study tests a partial mediational model by which the association between neighborhood disadvantage (census-level poverty, undereducation, and unemployment), and the volume of weekly alcohol consumption, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) among Puerto Ricans in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is partially mediated by perceived neighborhood collective efficacy (social cohesion and social control). Data are from a household random sample of 1,510 adults in San Juan, Puerto Rico (response rate, 83%). The direct effect of collective efficacy on the alcohol-related outcomes was not statistically significant. Census-level education and unemployment had no direct influence on collective efficacy. For both men and women, there were no indirect effects of the three census-level indicators of disadvantage on collective efficacy and, in turn, on binge drinking, weekly consumption, and lifetime or past-year AUD. Men residing in areas with high undereducation were less likely to report past-year AUD, and women living in these areas were less likely to report lifetime AUD. Women residing in high poverty areas also reported higher rates of lifetime AUD. The effect of neighborhood disadvantage on drinking outcomes was not explained by collective efficacy. Other factors such as family cohesion or social support may be more important than collective efficacy in mediating the effects of neighborhood disadvantage on drinking outcomes in Puerto Rico.

As assessed from National Swedish registers, SUD is measured by alcohol use disorder (AUD) and drug use disorder (DUD) and PSD by unemployment (UN), low income (LI), and high community deprivation (HCD). A cross-lagged structural equation model from ages 31 to 48 is applied to the native Swedish population born 1960-1980 and residing in Sweden at age 29 followed through 2017 ( All models fitted well. Focusing on the cross-lagged paths, across sexes, substances, and forms of PSD, parameter estimates for the SUD to PSD paths consistently exceeded those for the parallel PSD to SUD paths. SUD to PSD paths were nearly all statistically significant. Although the UN to SUD and LI to SUD paths were usually significant, most HCD to SUD paths were not. The differences between the UN to SUD and SUD to UN paths grew larger with increasing age, whereas the opposite pattern was seen for the HCD to SUD and SUD to HCD paths. Across sexes, forms of SUD, and dimensions of PSD, in a fully parametrized and good-fitting cross-lagged model of middle adult life, a diagnosis of SUD consistently predicted future PSD whereas PSD often but not always predicted future SUD. The SUD to PSD paths were consistently larger than the parallel PSD to SUD paths. Our results suggest a bidirectional causal relationship between SUD and PSD across adulthood, driven largely, but not entirely, by the negative effects of SUD on future psychosocial functioning.",

    "abstract": "Human studies examining the cellular mechanisms behind sarcopenia, or age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, have produced inconsistent results. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the aging effects on protein expression, size and distribution of fibers with various myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. Study eligibility included MyHC comparisons between young (18-49 years) and older (\u2265 60 years) adults, with 27 studies identified. Relative protein expression was higher with age for the slow-contracting MyHC I fibers, with correspondingly lower fast-contracting MyHC II and IIA values. Fiber sizes were similar with age for MyHC I, while smaller for MyHC II and IIA. Fiber distributions were similar with age. When separated by sex, the few studies that examined females showed atrophy of MyHC II and IIA fibers with age, but no change in MyHC protein expression. Additional analyses by measurement technique, physical activity, and muscle biopsied provided important insights. In summary, age-related atrophy in fast-contracting fibers lead to more of the slow-contracting, lower force-producing isoform in older male muscles, which helps explain their age-related loss in whole muscle force, velocity, and power. Exercise or pharmacological interventions that shift MyHC expression towards faster isoforms and/or increase fast-contracting fiber size should decrease the prevalence of sarcopenia. Our findings also indicate that future studies need to include or focus solely on females, measure MyHC IIA and IIX isoforms separately, examine fiber type distribution, sample additional muscles to the vastus lateralis, and incorporate an objective measurement of physical activity.",

    "title": "Identifying Risk Factors for Late-Onset (50+) Alcohol Use Disorder and Heavy Drinking: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT This systematic review seeks to expand the description and understanding of late-onset AUD and asks \u201cWhich risk factors have been reported for late-onset heavy drinking and AUD?\u201d Method: Using PRISMA guidelines, a literature review and search was performed on May 19, 2015 using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and PsychInfo. Nine studies were included in the final review. Results: The search revealed that only very few studies have been conducted. Hence, the evidence is limited but suggests that stress, role/identity loss, and friends' approval of drinking are associated with an increased risk for late-onset AUD or heavy drinking, whereas retirement, death of a spouse or a close relative does not increase the risk. Discussion: Inherent differences in measurements and methodologies precluded a meta-analysis. Therefore, the results presented here are descriptive in nature. Most studies base their conclusions on a certain preconception of older adults with alcohol problems, which leads to a row of circular arguments. The factors that have been measured seem to have changed over time. Conclusion: There has been a lack of focus on the field of late-onset AUD since the 1970s, which possibly has led to misrepresentations and preconceptions on the complex nature of late-onset AUD. There is limited evidence for any specific risk factor for late-onset AUD or heavy drinking. We suggest the adoption of a qualitative approach to uncover what is intrinsic to late-onset AUD followed by quantitative studies with more agreement on methods and definitions.",

    "abstract": "Objective Growing evidence suggests that alcohol consumption is a risk factor for hearing loss; however, the evidence has been inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of alcohol consumption on hearing loss. Methods We searched several databases up to November 2021, for published articles using the keywords \u201calcohol drinking\u201d and \u201chearing loss\u201d. Two investigators independently conducted the study selection and data extraction. Based on the results of the heterogeneity analysis (Q statistic and I2 statistic), a fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the potential sources of heterogeneity and robustness of the pooled estimation. Publication bias in the literature was evaluated using Egger\u2019s test. Results In total, 18 (9 cross-sectional, 5 case-control, and 4 cohort) observational studies were identified in this search; 27,849 participants were included. Compared with non-drinkers, the pooled OR of drinkers was 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.09\u20131.35). Conclusion Evidence suggests a positive association between alcohol consumption and hearing loss. Drinkers were at a higher risk than non-drinkers. Drinking limitations may be useful for preventing hearing loss.",

    "title": "Digital therapeutics lead to clinically significant body weight loss in patients with metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatotic liver disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background: Most patients with metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatotic liver disease are unable to achieve clinically significant body weight loss with traditional in-person approaches. Digital therapeutic (DTx)-delivered interventions offer promise to remove barriers to weight loss success inherent to traditional resource-heavy in-person programs and at a population level, but their efficacy remains relatively unknown. Methods: Published studies were identified through May 2023 by searching the following electronic databases: PubMed and Embase (Ovid). DTx intervention was compared to standard of care. The primary outcome was a change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included clinically significant body weight loss (\u22655%) and change in liver enzymes. Results: Eight studies comprising 1001 patients met inclusion criteria (mean age: 47 y; body mass index: 33.2 kg/m2). The overall rate of clinically significant body weight loss was 33%, with DTx lifestyle interventions ranging from 4 to 24 months in length. DTx lifestyle intervention achieved statistically significant body weight loss (absolute change \u22123.4 kg, 95% CI: \u22124.8 to \u22122.0 kg, p < 0.01, relative change \u22123.9%, 95% CI: \u22126.6 to \u22121.3, p < 0.01) as well as clinically significant body weight loss of \u22655% (risk ratio: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7\u20135.5, p < 0.01) compared to standard of care. This was seen alongside improvement in liver enzymes. Conclusions: DTx-delivered lifestyle intervention programs lead to greater amounts of body weight loss than traditional in-person lifestyle counseling. These results further support the role of DTx in delivering lifestyle intervention programs to patients with metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatotic liver disease and suggest that this scalable intervention offers promise to benefit the billions of patients worldwide with this condition.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is no widely acceptable and proven effective treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019). Colchicine has been shown to offer a benefit in reducing the inflammation in several inflammatory diseases. This study aims to analyze the efficacy of colchicine administration and outcomes of COVID\u201019. We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until January 29, 2021. All articles published on COVID\u201019 and colchicine treatment were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies and Revised Cochrane risk\u2010of\u2010bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) for clinical trial studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. A total of eight studies with 5778 COVID\u201019 patients were included in this meta\u2010analysis. This meta\u2010analysis showed that the administration of colchicine was associated with improvement of outcomes of COVID\u201019 [OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.34\u20130.55), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, fixed\u2010effect modelling] and its subgroup which comprised of reduction from severe COVID\u201019 [OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.31\u20130.63), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, fixed\u2010effect modelling] and reduction of mortality rate from COVID\u201019 [OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.32\u20130.58), p < 0.00001, I2 = 0%, fixed\u2010effect modelling].

    "abstract": "Substantial COVID-19 research investment has been allocated to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, which currently face recruitment challenges or early discontinuation. We aim to estimate the effects of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on survival in COVID-19 from all currently available RCT evidence, published and unpublished. We present a rapid meta-analysis of ongoing, completed, or discontinued RCTs on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment for any COVID-19 patients (protocol: https://osf.io/QESV4/). We systematically identified unpublished RCTs (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Cochrane COVID-registry up to June 11, 2020), and published RCTs (PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv up to October 16, 2020). All-cause mortality has been extracted (publications/preprints) or requested from investigators and combined in random-effects meta-analyses, calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), separately for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. Prespecified subgroup analyses include patient setting, diagnostic confirmation, control type, and publication status. Sixty-three trials were potentially eligible. We included 14 unpublished trials (1308 patients) and 14 publications/preprints (9011 patients). Results for hydroxychloroquine are dominated by RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY, two highly pragmatic trials, which employed relatively high doses and included 4716 and 1853 patients, respectively (67% of the total sample size). The combined OR on all-cause mortality for hydroxychloroquine is 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.20; I\u00b2\u2009=\u20090%; 26 trials; 10,012 patients) and for chloroquine 1.77 (95%CI: 0.15, 21.13, I\u00b2\u2009=\u20090%; 4 trials; 307 patients). We identified no subgroup effects. We found that treatment with hydroxychloroquine is associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients, and there is no benefit of chloroquine. Findings have unclear generalizability to outpatients, children, pregnant women, and people with comorbidities. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been investigated as a potential treatment for Covid-19 in several clinical trials. Here the authors report a meta-analysis of published and unpublished trials, and show that treatment with hydroxychloroquine for patients with Covid-19 was associated with increased mortality, and there was no benefit from chloroquine.",

    "title": "Survival Outcomes of Breast-Conserving Surgery Versus Mastectomy in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Mastectomy (MT) and breast conservation surgery (BCS) are two common surgical options for the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is frequently administered before surgery to shrink tumors and improve surgical outcomes. However, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal surgical approach after NACT and its impact on survival outcomes. Objective This meta-analysis aims to compare the survival outcomes between MT and BCS in patients treated with NACT. Method A PRISMA selection was used to identify studies across electronic database such as PubMed, and Cochrane Library from inception until 11th July, 2023. A total of 10 comparative studies involving a total of 5018 patients were included. Among them, 2898 patients underwent MT while 2120 underwent BCS after receiving NACT. The outcomes assessed were the 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS). The data from the included studies were pooled, and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to evaluate the differences between MT and BCS in terms of survival outcomes. Prospero: CRD42024496831. Result The meta-analysis revealed that patients who underwent MT after NACT had a higher 5-year OS compared to those who underwent BCS (OR 2.68, 95% CI [2.19-3.28; p\u2009<\u20090.00001]). Additionally, the 5-year DFS was significantly better for patients who underwent MT (OR 3.11, 95% CI [1.80-5.38; p\u2009<\u20090.0001]). Conclusion MT after NACT may be associated with better 5-year OS and DFS compared to BCS.",

    "title": "Vitamin D Supplementation and Its Impact on Mortality and Cardiovascular Outcomes: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 80 Randomized Clinical Trials",
    "abstract": "Background: The impact of vitamin D supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality risk reduction remains unclear due to conflicting study findings. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published between 1983 and 2022, that reported the effect of vitamin D supplementation in adults versus placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality (ACM), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), non-cardiovascular mortality (non-CVM), and cardiovascular morbidities. Only studies with a follow-up period longer than one year were included. The primary outcomes were ACM and CVM. Secondary outcomes were non-CVM, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and major or extended adverse cardiovascular events. Subgroup analyses were performed according to low-, fair- and good-quality RCTs. Results: Eighty RCTs were assessed, including 82,210 participants receiving vitamin D supplementation and 80,921 receiving placebo or no treatment. The participants\u2019 mean (SD) age was 66.1 (11.2) years, and 68.6% were female. Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a lower risk of ACM (OR: 0.95 [95%CI 0.91\u20130.99] p = 0.013), was close to statistical significance for a lower risk of non-CVM (OR: 0.94 [95%CI 0.87\u20131.00] p = 0.055), and was not statistically associated with a lower risk of any cardiovascular morbi-mortality outcome. Meta-analysis of low-quality RCTs showed no association with cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular morbi-mortality outcomes. Conclusions: The emerging results of our meta-analysis present evidence that vitamin D supplementation appears to decrease the risk of ACM (especially convincing in the fair- and good-quality RCTs), while not showing a decrease in the specific cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. Thus, we conclude that further research is warranted in this area, with well-planned and executed studies as the basis for more robust recommendations.",

    "title": "Outcomes from low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "The current standard of treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. With a growing debate about overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk DCIS, active surveillance is being explored in several ongoing trials. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the recurrence of low-risk DCIS under various treatment approaches. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane were searched for studies reporting ipsilateral breast tumour event (IBTE), contralateral breast cancer (CBC), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) rates at 5 and 10 years in low-risk DCIS. The primary outcome was invasive IBTE (iIBTE) defined as invasive progression in the ipsilateral breast. Thirty three eligible studies were identified, involving 47,696 women with low-risk DCIS. The pooled 5-year and 10-year iIBTE rates were 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3, 8.1) and 5.9% (95% CI: 3.8, 9.0), respectively. The iIBTE rates were significantly lower in patients who underwent surgery compared to those who did not, at 5 years (3.5% vs. 9.0%, P\u2009=\u20090.003) and 10 years (6.4% vs. 22.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.008). Similarly, the 10-year BCSS rate was higher in the surgery group (96.0% vs. 99.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.010). In patients treated with breast-conserving surgery, additional radiotherapy significantly reduced IBTE risk, but not total-CBC risk. This review showed a lower risk of progression and better survival in women who received surgery and additional RT for low-risk DCIS. However, our findings were primarily based on observational studies, and should be confirmed with the results from the ongoing trials.",

Overall chronicity occurred in 25% of patients (95% CI: 23\u201029, n=170, mean follow\u2010up: 59.3\u00b171.2 months, no significant ED\u2010group difference). The chronicity rate was 33% at <2 years, 40% at 2 to <4 years, 23% at 4 to <6 years, 25% at 6 to <8 years, 12% at 8 to <10 years, and 18% at \u226510 years. Mortality occurred in 0.4% of patients (95% CI: 0.2\u20100.7, n=214, mean follow\u2010up: 72.2\u00b1117.7 months, no significant ED\u2010group difference). Considering observational studies, the mortality rate was 5.2 deaths/1,000 person\u2010years (95% CI: 4.4\u20106.1, n=167, mean follow\u2010up: 88.7\u00b1120.5 months; significant difference among EDs: p<0.01, range: from 8.2 for mixed ED to 3.4 for BN). Hospitalization occurred in 26% of patients (95% CI: 18\u201036, n=18, mean follow\u2010up: 43.2\u00b141.6 months; significant difference among EDs: p<0.001, range: from 32% for AN to 4% for BN). Regarding diagnostic migration, 8% of patients with AN migrated to BN and 16% to OSFED; 2% of patients with BN migrated to AN, 5% to BED, and 19% to OSFED; 9% of patients with BED migrated to BN and 19% to OSFED; 7% of patients with OSFED migrated to AN and 10% to BN. Children/adolescents had more favorable outcomes across and within EDs than adults. Self\u2010injurious behaviors were associated with lower recovery rates in pooled EDs. A higher socio\u2010demographic index moderated lower recovery and higher chronicity in AN across countries. Specific treatments associated with higher recovery rates were family\u2010based therapy, cognitive\u2010behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and nutritional interventions for AN; self\u2010help, CBT, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), psychodynamic therapy, nutritional and pharmacological treatments for BN; CBT, nutritional and pharmacological interventions, and DBT for BED; and CBT and psychodynamic therapy for OSFED. In AN, pharmacological treatment was associated with lower recovery, and waiting list with higher mortality. These results should inform future research, clinical practice and health service organization for persons with EDs.",

    "title": "The association between HER2-low status and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors significantly altered the treatment landscape of hormone-positive (HR+), HER2- metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, biomarkers predicting long-term benefit and early progression are yet to be defined. Several studies suggested the possibility of diminished efficacy in patients with HER2-low disease. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between low-level HER2 expression and efficacy outcomes (PFS, OS, ORR) with CDK 4/6 inhibitors. The Pubmed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were used to systematically filter the published studies from inception to 08 August 2023 for this systemic review. Studies including MBC patients treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors and reported survival outcomes according to HER2 expression were included. We performed the meta-analyses with the generic inverse-variance method with a fixed-effects model and used HRs with 95% two-sided CIs as the principal summary measure. Nine studies encompassing 2705 patients were included in the analyses. In the pooled analysis of nine studies, the risk of progression and/or death was higher in patients with HER2-low tumors compared to HER2-zero (HR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.35, p\u2009<\u20090.001). In the pooled analysis of five studies, although the median follow-up was short, the risk of death was higher in the HER2-low group compared to the HER2-zero group (HR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.44, p\u2009=\u20090.010). The available evidence demonstrates a significantly higher risk of progression or death with CDK 4/6 inhibitors in HER2-low tumors. Further research is needed to improve outcomes in patients with HR+-HER2-low tumors.",

    "title": "Long-term employment outcomes following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Returning to employment following moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI) is critical for a survivor\u2019s well-being, yet currently there are no systematic reviews that comprehensively describe employment outcomes following msTBI. The objective of this study was to systematically synthesize literature on employment outcomes following msTBI. Methods: Original studies published through April 2018 on MEDLINE/PubMed, PsychINFO, and CINAHL were eligible if the objective was to investigate employment outcomes following msTBI; outcome was measured \u22651 year; participants were \u226515; and size was \u226560. Post-injury employment prevalence and return to pre-injury level of work were summarized through meta-analysis. Results: Of 38 eligible studies, post-injury employment prevalence was most often reported (n = 35), followed by job stability (n = 6), and return to pre-injury level of work (n = 4). Overall post-injury employment prevalence was 42.2%; whereas the return-to-previous-work prevalence was 33.0%. Post-injury employment prevalence appeared to increase over time, from 34.9% at 1 year to 42.1% up to 5 years and 49.9% beyond 5 years. Conclusion: Nearly half of individuals with msTBI were employed post-injury, yet only a third returned to pre-injury level of work. Future researchers are recommended to standardize employment outcome measures to enable better comparison of outcomes across studies.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of interventions to improve employment for people released from prison: systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background People released from prison experience complex health challenges in addition to challenges resettling into the community. Consequently, employment rates are low. Participating in good quality employment can support good health and is protective against future reoffending. Multiple interventions are provided to support people into employment on release. The effectiveness of interventions for improving employment outcomes has not previously been evaluated in a meta-analysis. Aim Our objective was to examine the effectiveness of interventions to improve employment following release from prison. Method We searched seven databases and three trial registries for peer reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published since 2010, that included adults and measured an employment outcome(s). We conducted meta-analysis using random effects models with sub-group and sensitivity analyses. We appraised bias risk per outcome, and incorporated this into an assessment of the certainty estimates for each outcome. A group of people with experience of imprisonment met with us throughout the project to inform our search strategy and interpretation of results. Results We included 12 RCTs (2,875 participants) which were all conducted in the USA. Few outcomes were of low risk of bias. Intervention participants were 2.5 times more likely to work at least one day (95% CI:1.82\u20133.43) and worked more days over 12\u00a0months (MD\u2009=\u200959.07, 95% CI:15.83\u2013102.32) compared to controls. There was no effect on average employment status or employment at study end. There is moderate certainty in these estimates. Conclusion Interventions can improve some employment outcomes for people released from prison. More evidence is required to establish effective interventions for sustaining quality employment, particularly outside the USA, and which consider outcomes for different groups of people released, such as women or those with health or substance use needs.",

    "abstract": "Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus chemotherapy is effective in advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) cancer. This study aims to evaluate the clinical effect of first-line immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy for advanced G/GEJ cancer. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane databases were systematically searched from the inception of the databases to December 2021. Randomized trials comparing ICI plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy in first-line treatment for advanced G/GEJ cancer were included. The outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and adverse events (AEs). Analyses were performed in Stata 14.0 software. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42022300907. Results: Five trials were included for analysis, involving 2, 814 patients. ICI plus chemotherapy can significantly improve OS (hazards ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% CI 0.78-0.94; P\u2009=\u2009.002), PFS (HR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.63-0.99; P\u2009\uff1c\u2009.001) and ORR (relative ratio [RR], 1.20; 95% CI 1.11-1.30; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In safety analyses, there were no significant differences in incidence of all AEs, treatment-related adverse event (TRAE), TRAE of grade 3 or higher, serious TRAE and TRAE leading to death between two arms (P\u2009>\u2009.05). Conclusions: ICI plus chemotherapy is more effective first-line treatment for advanced G/GEJ cancer in contrast to chemotherapy regrading to improving OS, PFS and ORR, without increasing TRAE risk. This study will redefine the role of ICI in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line setting for G/GEJ cancer, and provide reference for clinical treatment.",

    "title": "Optimal Dose of Baclofen for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Baclofen, a traditional treatment for spasticity, is gaining interest for its use in alcohol use disorder (AUD). To assist clinicians in using baclofen for effective and safe treatment of AUD, we investigated the optimal target dosage of baclofen through a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. We searched Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE via\u00a0PubMed, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for randomized controlled trials on 1 and 2 April 2024. Inclusion criteria were patients aged \u2265 18 years diagnosed with AUD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV, DSM-IV-TR, or International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10, and treated with baclofen monotherapy. Continuous outcomes-percent days abstinent, drinks per drinking day, heavy drinking days (HDDs), craving, and anxiety-were analyzed as mean or standardized mean differences. Binary outcomes-relapse and dropout, including due to adverse events-were analyzed as odds ratios. Each outcome was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. A one-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was performed using restricted cubic splines with fixed knots at 10%, 50%, and 90% percentiles. A total of 14 trials (1344 patients) were included. Increasing the dose of baclofen up to 50-60 mg/day was associated with a higher percent days abstinent and reduced craving. However, a higher baclofen dose\u00a0increases the risk of dropout due to adverse events. Commonly observed adverse events were drowsiness, sedation, somnolence and fatigue. Baclofen up to 50-60 mg/day did not significantly affect drinks per drinking day, HDDs, anxiety, relapse or dropout. Doses > 60 mg/day lacked reliable evaluation due to limited data and study heterogeneity. Baclofen up to 50-60 mg/day may increase percent days abstinent and reduce craving, but may increase dropout due to adverse events. Clinicians should carefully consider individual patient factors when prescribing baclofen to patients with AUD.",

    "title": "Protocol for a multi-centre, definitive randomised controlled trial of the effectiveness of Individual Placement and Support for employment support among people with alcohol and drug dependence.",
    "abstract": "Unemployment is highly prevalent in populations with alcohol and drug dependence and the employment support offered in addiction-treatment programmes is ineffective. Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based intervention for competitive employment. IPS has been extensively studied in severe mental illness and physical disabilities, but there have been no formal randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in alcohol and drug dependence. The Individual Placement and Support for Alcohol and Drug Dependence (IPS-AD) study should determine whether IPS for patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), opioid use disorder (OUD) and other drug use disorder is effective. The IPS-AD study is a seven-site, pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, superiority RCT. IPS-AD includes a realist process evaluation. Eligible patients (adult, unemployed or economically inactive for at least 6\u2009months and wishing to obtain open job market employment and enrolled in ongoing community treatment-as-usual (TAU; the control condition) in England for AUD, OUD and other drug use disorders) will be randomised (1:1) to receive TAU and any standard employment support, or TAU plus IPS (the experimental condition) for 9 months with up to 4 months of in-work support. The primary outcome measure will be competitive employment status (at least 1 day (7\u2009h)) during an 18-month follow-up, determined by patient-level, trial-data-linkage with national tax and state benefit databases. From meta-analysis, an 18% target difference on this measure of vocational effectiveness (for the experimental intervention) and a two-sided 5% level of statistical significance, will require a minimum target sample of 832 participants to achieve 90% power for a pre-registered, mixed-effects, multi-variable logistic regression model. A maximum-likelihood multiple-imputation approach will manage missing outcome data. IPS-AD has six vocational secondary outcome measures during the 18-month follow-up: (1) total time in competitive employment (and corresponding National Insurance contributions and tax paid); (2) time from randomisation to first competitive employment; (3) number of competitive job appointments; (4) job tenure (length of longest held competitive employment); (5) sustained employment (tenure in a single appointment for at least 13\u2009weeks); and (6) job search self-efficacy. A primary cost-benefit analysis and a secondary cost-effectiveness analysis will be done using the primary outcome and secondary vocational outcomes, respectively and will include addiction treatment and social and health outcomes and their associated reference costs. The process evaluation will address IPS implementation and delivery. The IPS-AD study is the first large-scale, multi-site, definitive, superiority RCT of IPS for people with alcohol and drug dependence.

    "title": "Clinically-indicated replacement versus routine replacement of peripheral venous catheters.",
    "abstract": "US Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommend replacement of peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVC) no more frequently than every 72 to 96 hours. Routine replacement is thought to reduce the risk of phlebitis and bloodstream infection. Catheter insertion is an unpleasant experience for patients and replacement may be unnecessary if the catheter remains functional and there are no signs of inflammation or infection. Costs associated with routine replacement may be considerable. This is the third update of a review first published in 2010. To assess the effects of removing peripheral intravenous catheters when clinically indicated compared with removing and re-siting the catheter routinely. The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 18 April 2018. We also undertook reference checking, and contacted researchers and manufacturers to identify additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials that compared routine removal of PIVC with removal only when clinically indicated, in hospitalised or community-dwelling patients receiving continuous or intermittent infusions. Three review authors independently reviewed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane methods. We used GRADE to assess the overall evidence certainty. This update contains two new trials, taking the total to nine included studies with 7412 participants. Eight trials were conducted in acute hospitals and one in a community setting. We rated the overall certainty of evidence as moderate for most outcomes, due to serious risk of bias for unblinded outcome assessment or imprecision, or both. Because outcome assessment was unblinded in all of the trials, none met our criteria for high methodological quality.Primary outcomesSeven trials (7323 participants), assessed catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). There is no clear difference in the incidence of CRBSI between the clinically indicated (1/3590) and routine change (2/3733) groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 4.68), low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for serious imprecision).All trials reported incidence of thrombophlebitis and we combined the results from seven of these in the analysis (7323 participants). We excluded two studies in the meta-analysis because they contributed to high heterogeneity. There is no clear difference in the incidence of thrombophlebitis whether catheters were changed according to clinical indication or routinely (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.25; clinically indicated 317/3590; 3-day change 307/3733, moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded once for serious risk of bias). The result was unaffected by whether the infusion was continuous or intermittent. Six trials provided thrombophlebitis rates by number of device days (32,709 device days). There is no clear difference between groups (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.08; clinically indicated 248/17,251; 3-day change 236/15,458; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded once for serious risk of bias).One trial (3283 participants), assessed all-cause blood stream infection (BSI). We found no clear difference in the all-cause BSI rate between the two groups (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.53; clinically indicated: 4/1593 (0.02%); routine change 9/1690 (0.05%); moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded one level for serious imprecision).Three trials (4244 participants), investigated costs; clinically indicated removal probably reduces device-related costs by approximately AUD 7.00 compared with routine removal (MD -6.96, 95% CI -9.05 to -4.86; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded once for serious risk of bias).Secondary outcomesSix trials assessed infiltration (7123 participants). Routine replacement probably reduces infiltration of fluid into surrounding tissues compared with a clinically indicated change (RR 1.16 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.26; routine replacement 747/3638 (20.5%); clinically indicated 834/3485 (23.9%); moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded once for serious risk of bias).Meta-analysis of seven trials (7323 participants), found that rates of catheter failure due to blockage were probably lower in the routine-replacement group compared to the clinically indicated group (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.29; routine-replacement 519/3733 (13.9%); clinically indicated 560/3590 (15.6%); moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded once for serious risk of bias).Four studies (4606 participants), reported local infection rates. It is uncertain if there are differences between groups (RR 4.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 102.98; clinically indicated 2/2260 (0.09%); routine replacement 0/2346 (0.0%); very low-certainty evidence, downgraded one level for serious risk of bias and two levels for very serious imprecision).One trial (3283 participants), found no clear difference in the incidence of mortality when clinically indicated removal was compared with routine removal (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27 to 4.23; low-certainty evidence, downgraded two levels for very serious imprecision).One small trial (198 participants) reported no clear difference in device-related pain between clinically indicated and routine removal groups (MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.44 to 0.24; low-certainty evidence, downgraded one level for serious risk of bias and one level for serious imprecision).The pre-planned outcomes 'number of catheter re-sites per patient', and 'satisfaction' were not reported by any studies included in this review. There is moderate-certainty evidence of no clear difference in rates of CRBSI, thrombophlebitis, all-cause BSI, mortality and pain between clinically indicated or routine replacement of PIVC. We are uncertain if local infection is reduced or increased when catheters are changed when clinically indicated. There is moderate-certainty evidence that infiltration and catheter blockage is probably lower when PIVC are changed routinely; and moderate-certainty evidence that clinically indicated removal probably reduces device-related costs. The addition of two new trials for this update found no further evidence to support changing catheters every 72 to 96 hours. Healthcare organisations may consider changing to a policy whereby catheters are changed only if there is a clinical indication to do so, for example, if there were signs of infection, blockage or infiltration. This would provide significant cost savings, spare patients the unnecessary pain of routine re-sites in the absence of clinical indications and would reduce time spent by busy clinicians on this intervention. To minimise PIVC-related complications, staff should inspect the insertion site at each shift change and remove the catheter if signs of inflammation, infiltration, occlusion, infection or blockage are present, or if the catheter is no longer needed for therapy.",

    "title": "The Effect of Social Determinants of Health on Clinical Recovery Following Concussion: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "CONTEXT\nConcussion evaluations include a multifaceted approach; however, individual differences can influence test score interpretations and validity. Social determinants of health (SDoH) differentially affect disease risk and outcomes based upon social and environmental characteristics. Efforts to better define, diagnose, manage, and treat concussion have increased, but minimal efforts have focused on examining SDoH that may affect concussion recovery.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis review examined previous research that examined the effect of SDoH on concussion recovery of athletes.\n\n\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION\nCINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and SPORTDiscus databases were used to search the terms \"concussion\" AND \"recovery,\" \"youth, adolescent, teen and/or adult,\" and \"social determinants of health\" and variations of these terms. The evidence level for each study was evaluated using the 2011 Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine Guide.\n\n\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS\nSeven thousand nine hundred and twenty-one articles were identified and screened for inclusion. Five studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Using the Downs and Black Quality Index, the studies included in this review were deemed high quality.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThough limited literature exists, there is preliminary evidence to suggest that SDoH (specifically, economic stability, education access and quality, and social and community context) may have an impact on the clinical recovery from concussion. The dimensions evaluated varied between studies and the results were inconsistent. No single factor consistently affected clinical recovery; however, private insurance and race appear to have an association with the speed of recovery. Unfortunately, the potential intersection of these variables and other preinjury factors limits the ability to make clear recommendations. While most of the studies in this review are retrospective in nature, future efforts should focus on training clinicians to prospectively evaluate the effect of SDoH on concussion recovery and injury outcomes. Funding and registration for this systematic review were not obtained nor required.",

    "title": "Social determinants of multimorbidity patterns: A systematic review",
    "abstract": "Social determinants of multimorbidity are poorly understood in clinical practice. This review aims to characterize the different multimorbidity patterns described in the literature while identifying the social and behavioral determinants that may affect their emergence and subsequent evolution. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO and Google Scholar. In total, 97 studies were chosen from the 48,044 identified. Cardiometabolic, musculoskeletal, mental, and respiratory patterns were the most prevalent. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity profiles were common among men with low socioeconomic status, while musculoskeletal, mental and complex patterns were found to be more prevalent among women. Alcohol consumption and smoking increased the risk of multimorbidity, especially in men. While the association of multimorbidity with lower socioeconomic status is evident, patterns of mild multimorbidity, mental and respiratory related to middle and high socioeconomic status are also observed. The findings of the present review point to the need for further studies addressing the impact of multimorbidity and its social determinants in population groups where this problem remains invisible (e.g., women, children, adolescents and young adults, ethnic groups, disabled population, older people living alone and/or with few social relations), as well as further work with more heterogeneous samples (i.e., not only focusing on older people) and using more robust methodologies for better classification and subsequent understanding of multimorbidity patterns. Besides, more studies focusing on the social determinants of multimorbidity and its inequalities are urgently needed in low- and middle-income countries, where this problem is currently understudied.",

    "title": "Interventions targeting social determinants of mental disorders and the Sustainable Development Goals: A systematic review of reviews",
    "abstract": "Introduction Globally, mental disorders account for almost 20% of disease burden and there is growing evidence that mental disorders are associated with various social determinants. Tackling the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which address known social determinants of mental disorders, may be an effective way to reduce the global burden of mental disorders. Objectives To examine the evidence base for interventions that seek to improve mental health through targeting the social determinants of mental disorders. Methods We conducted a systematic review of reviews, using a five-domain conceptual framework which aligns with the UN SDGs (PROSPERO registration: CRD42022361534). PubMed, PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched from 01 January 2012 until 05 October 2022. Citation follow-up and expert consultation were used to identify additional studies. Systematic reviews including interventions seeking to change or improve a social determinant of mental disorders were eligible for inclusion. Study screening, selection, data extraction, and quality appraisal were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The AMSTAR-2 was used to assess included reviews and results were narratively synthesised. Results Over 20,000 records were screened, and 101 eligible reviews were included. Most reviews were of low, or critically low, quality. Reviews included interventions which targeted sociocultural (n = 31), economic (n = 24), environmental (n = 19), demographic (n = 15), and neighbourhood (n = 8) determinants of mental disorders. Interventions demonstrating the greatest promise for improved mental health from high and moderate quality reviews (n = 37) included: digital and brief advocacy interventions for female survivors of intimate partner violence; cash transfers for people in low-middle-income countries; improved work schedules, parenting programs, and job clubs in the work environment; psychosocial support programs for vulnerable individuals following environmental events; and social and emotional learning programs for school students. Few effective neighbourhood-level interventions were identified. Conclusions This review presents interventions with the strongest evidence base for the prevention of mental disorders and highlights synergies where addressing the UN SDGs can be beneficial for mental health. A range of issues across the literature were identified, including barriers to conducting randomised controlled trials and lack of follow-up limiting the ability to measure long-term mental health outcomes. Interdisciplinary and novel approaches to intervention design, implementation, and evaluation are required to improve the social circumstances and mental health experienced by individuals, communities, and populations.

    "title": "Screening tools to address social determinants of health in the United States: A systematic review",
    "abstract": "Abstract The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have mandated that hospitals implement measures to screen social determinants of health (SDoH). We sought to report on available SDoH screening tools. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, as well as the grey literature were searched (1980 to November 2023). The included studies were US-based, written in English, and examined a screening tool to assess SDoH. Thirty studies were included in the analytic cohort. The number of questions in any given SDoH assessment tool varied considerably and ranged from 5 to 50 (mean: 16.6). A total of 19 SDoH domains were examined. Housing (n = 23, 92%) and safety/violence (n = 21, 84%) were the domains assessed most frequently. Food/nutrition (n = 17, 68%), income/financial (n = 16, 64%), transportation (n = 15, 60%), family/social support (n = 14, 56%), utilities (n = 13, 52%), and education/literacy (n = 13, 52%) were also commonly included domains in most screening tools. Eighteen studies proposed specific interventions to address SDoH. SDoH screening tools are critical to identify various social needs and vulnerabilities to help develop interventions to address patient needs. Moreover, there is marked heterogeneity of SDoH screening tools, as well as the significant variability in the SDoH domains assessed by currently available screening tools.",

    "abstract": "Despite ample evidence linking social determinants of health (SDoH) and hypertension outcomes, efforts to address SDoH in the context of hypertension prevention and self-management are not commensurate with the burden and impact of hypertension. To provide valuable insights into the development of targeted and effective strategies for preventing and managing hypertension, this systematic review, guided by the Healthy People 2030 SDoH framework, aims to summarize the inclusion, measurement, and evaluation of SDoH in studies examining hypertension outcomes, with a focus on characterizing SDoH constructs and summarizing the current evidence of their influence on hypertension outcomes. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive search of electronic databases identified 10\u2005608 unique records, from which 57 articles meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed. The studies, conducted nationally or regionally across the United States, revealed that higher educational attainment, health insurance coverage, income, and favorable neighborhood characteristics were associated with lower hypertension prevalence and better hypertension control among US adults. The findings underscore the importance of addressing SDoH such as education, health care access, economic stability, neighborhood environments, and social context to reduce hypertension disparities. Multilevel collaboration and community-engaged practices are necessary to tackle these disparities effectively.",

    "title": "Standardizing social determinants of health data: a proposal for a comprehensive screening tool to address health equity a systematic review",
    "abstract": "Abstract Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly impacts health outcomes and disparities. While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has mandated hospitals to collect standardized SDoH data, existing tools lack key elements. This systematic review identified 78 studies and 20 screening tools addressing various SDoH domains. However, most tools were missing several key domains and lacked standardization. We propose a comprehensive tool meeting essential criteria: validated questions, brevity, actionability, cultural appropriateness, workflow integration, and community linkage. Our tool addresses gaps in available tools and incorporates standardized and validated questions to enable patient-centered screening for diverse social and environmental determinants of health. It uniquely includes detailed race/ethnicity data collection, housing characteristics, physical activity assessment, access to healthy food measures, and environmental exposure evaluation. The tool aims to provide actionable data for immediate interventions while informing broader population health strategies and policy initiatives. By offering a holistic assessment of SDoH across multiple domains, our tool enables standardized data collection, risk stratification, and focused initiatives to address health inequities at both individual and population levels. Further research is needed to develop evidence-based pathways for integrating SDoH data into real-world patient care workflows, improve risk prediction algorithms, address health-related social needs, and reduce disparities.",

    "title": "Exploring Social Determinants of Mental Health of Older Unforced Migrants: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background and Objectives Although the vulnerabilities stemming from the intersection of aging and migration are widely recognized, the migration contexts and the factors influencing the mental health of older unforced migrants have received scant attention. This review explores the drivers of unforced migrations in later life and the individual, relational, and structural factors influencing their mental health and well-being. Research Design and Methods Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic search of 7 databases for English peer-reviewed journal articles was conducted. A total of 21 studies were identified and analyzed inductively. Results The review classified motivations for migration as push factors and pull factors: push factors such as escaping structural inequities in the homeland and pull factors included seeking better lifestyle opportunities and reuniting with family. The positive determinants of mental health included cordial family relationships, paid employment, the presence of a partner, and strong support networks. Advanced age, absence of a partner, lifestyle changes, lack of intergenerational support, poor language proficiency, unfavorable policies, lack of access to resources, and systemic biases negatively affected the mental health of older unforced migrants. Discussion and Implications The review highlights the need to recognize the diversity among older migrants to develop policies and programs that address their specific circumstances. Recognizing their strengths, rather than focusing solely on their vulnerabilities will help create a more positive and supportive environment, enabling them to thrive in their new communities.",

    "abstract": "There remains a need to synthesize linkages between social determinants of health (SDOH) and cancer screening to reduce persistent inequities contributing to the US cancer burden. The authors conducted a systematic review of US\u2010based breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening intervention studies to summarize how SDOH have been considered in interventions and relationships between SDOH and screening. Five databases were searched for peer\u2010reviewed research articles published in English between 2010 and 2021. The Covidence software platform was used to screen articles and extract data using a standardized template. Data items included study and intervention characteristics, SDOH intervention components and measures, and screening outcomes. The findings were summarized using descriptive statistics and narratives. The review included 144 studies among diverse population groups. SDOH interventions increased screening rates overall by a median of 8.4 percentage points (interquartile interval, 1.8\u201318.8 percentage points). The objective of most interventions was to increase community demand (90.3%) and access (84.0%) to screening. SDOH interventions related to health care access and quality were most prevalent (227 unique intervention components). Other SDOH, including educational, social/community, environmental, and economic factors, were less common (90, 52, 21, and zero intervention components, respectively). Studies that included analyses of health policy, access to care, and lower costs yielded the largest proportions of favorable associations with screening outcomes. SDOH were predominantly measured at the individual level. This review describes how SDOH have been considered in the design and evaluation of cancer screening interventions and effect sizes for SDOH interventions. Findings may guide future intervention and implementation research aiming to reduce US screening inequities.",

Several studies have synthesized evidence about the influence of SDH on childhood injury risks and outcomes. However, there is no systematic evidence about the impact of SDH on accessing care and quality of care once a child has suffered an injury. We aim to evaluate the extent to which access to care and quality of care after injury are affected by children and adolescents\u2019 SDH. Methods Using Cochrane methodology, we will conduct a systematic review including observational and experimental studies evaluating the association between social/material elements contributing to health disparities, using the PROGRESS-Plus framework: place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital and care received by children and adolescents (\u2264\u200919\u00a0years of age) after injury. We will consult published literature using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Academic Search Premier and grey literature using Google Scholar from their inception to a maximum of 6\u00a0months prior to submission for publication. Two reviewers will independently perform study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment for included studies.

We will analyze data to perform narrative syntheses, and if enough studies are identified, we will conduct a meta-analysis using random effects models. Discussion This systematic review will provide a synthesis of evidence on the association between SDH and pediatric trauma care (access to care and quality of care) that clinicians and policymakers can use to better tailor care systems and promote equitable access and quality of care for all children.

    "title": "Why Parents Say No to Having Their Children Vaccinated against Measles: A Systematic Review of the Social Determinants of Parental Perceptions on MMR Vaccine Hesitancy",
    "abstract": "Ongoing outbreaks of measles threaten its elimination status in the United States. Its resurgence points to lower parental vaccine confidence and local pockets of unvaccinated and undervaccinated individuals. The geographic clustering of hesitancy to MMR indicates the presence of social drivers that shape parental perceptions and decisions on immunization. Through a qualitative systematic review of published literature (n = 115 articles; 7 databases), we determined major themes regarding parental reasons for MMR vaccine hesitancy, social context of MMR vaccine hesitancy, and trustworthy vaccine information sources. Fear of autism was the most cited reason for MMR hesitancy. The social drivers of vaccine hesitancy included primary care/healthcare, education, economy, and government/policy factors. Social factors, such as income and education, exerted a bidirectional influence, which facilitated or hindered vaccine compliance depending on how the social determinant was experienced. Fear of autism was the most cited reason for MMR hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy to MMR and other childhood vaccines clustered in middle- to high-income areas among mothers with a college-level education or higher who preferred internet/social media narratives over physician-based vaccine information. They had low parental trust, low perceived disease susceptibility, and were skeptical of vaccine safety and benefits. Combating MMR vaccine misinformation and hesitancy requires intersectoral and multifaceted approaches at various socioecological levels to address the social drivers of vaccine behavior.",

    "abstract": "Despite primary care being largely free at the point of delivery, many Canadians experience challenges in accessing the services they need. A systematic review was conducted to summarize the evidence on the level of unmet need for primary care in Canada and its social determinants. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were screened from inception to December 2023 using relevant search terms for primary care and unmet healthcare needs. Quantitative observational studies in the English language that included Canadian adults aged 18 years and older and focused on unmet needs for primary care were included. The risk of bias in the studies was assessed using either the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist or the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale. The included studies were synthesized narratively. Forty-six studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Of the included studies, 96% were cross-sectional in design and 91% had low risk of bias. The prevalence of unmet need, mostly self-reported, varied between 6.6% and 25.2% in national studies. Social determinants of unmet needs were heterogeneous across studies. Findings suggest that unmet need for primary care is related to having low income, mental health diagnoses, and chronic conditions, and negatively associated with older age, having better-perceived health, and having a family physician. Universal access to primary care is the founding principle of the Canadian healthcare system. However, we found evidence suggesting that the extent to which primary care needs are met is influenced by social determinants of health. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of unmet primary care needs in Canada. PROSPERO CRD42021285074.",

    "title": "Influence of Social Determinants of Health on Heart Failure Outcomes: A Systematic Review",
    "abstract": "Background Prior research suggests an association between clinical outcomes in heart failure (HF) and social determinants of health (SDoH). Because providers should identify and address SDoH in care delivery, we evaluated how SDoH have been defined, measured, and evaluated in studies that examine HF outcomes. Methods and Results Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta\u2010Analysis guidelines, databases were searched for observational or interventional studies published between 2009 and 2021 that assessed the influence of SDoH on outcomes. Selected articles were assessed for quality using a validated rating scheme. We identified 1373 unique articles for screening; 104 were selected for full\u2010text review, and 59 met the inclusion criteria, including retrospective and prospective cohort, cross\u2010sectional, and intervention studies. The majority examined readmissions and hospitalizations (k=33), mortality or survival (k=29), and success of medical devices and transplantation (k=8). SDoH examined most commonly included race, ethnicity, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education or health literacy. Studies used a range of 1 to 9 SDoH as primary independent variables and 0 to 7 SDoH as controls. Multiple data sources were employed and frequently were electronic medical records linked with national surveys and disease registries. The effects of SDoH on HF outcomes were inconsistent because of the heterogeneity of data sources and SDoH constructs. Conclusions Our systematic review reveals shortcomings in measurement and deployment of SDoH variables in HF care. Validated measures need to be prospectively and intentionally collected to facilitate appropriate analysis, reporting, and replication of data across studies and inform the design of appropriate, evidence\u2010based interventions that can ameliorate significant HF morbidity and societal costs.",

    "title": "Role of ketamine in the treatment of substance use disorders: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) involve diminished control, risky use, impaired social interactions, and physical dependence. Despite their global prevalence and burden, treatment options remain limited. Ketamine (KET), an NMDA receptor antagonist, may aid SUD treatment by modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. This systematic review evaluates KET's role in SUD treatment. This review surveyed three databases until June 2024, including 14 studies with 551 participants. Among the 14 studies, 6 focused on alcohol, 3 on cocaine, 4 on opioids, and 1 on cannabis. Seven studies (50\u00a0%) combined KET with psychotherapy, while seven (50\u00a0%) focused solely on KET's pharmacological effects. KET dose ranges varied from 0.11\u00a0mg/kg to 2.0\u00a0mg/kg and study primary endpoints ranged from less than a day to two years. The results of the included studies demonstrated KET's efficacy across various SUDs. In Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), KET reduced withdrawal symptoms and benzodiazepine requirements. In Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD), KET decreased craving and increased abstinence rates. In Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), high-dose KET psychotherapy (KPT) improved abstinence and reduced craving. In Cannabis Use Disorder (CNUD), KET reduced weekly use and increased abstinence confidence. Conclusion: While preliminary studies suggest that KET may have short-term benefits in treating SUDs, the evidence remains limited by small sample sizes and a lack of randomized trials. Further research with larger, well-controlled studies is needed to determine optimal dosing, clarify mechanisms of action, and assess long-term efficacy and potential risks, including abuse liability, before broader clinical implementation can be recommended.",

    "title": "How effective are remote and/or digital interventions as part of alcohol and drug treatment and recovery support? A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Although remote drug/alcohol interventions have been widely reviewed, their effectiveness specifically for people in treatment remains unclear. We aimed to systematically review the effectiveness of remote interventions (delivered by telephone or computer) in alcohol/drug treatment and recovery support. We searched 29 databases including Medline and PsycINFO for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of remote interventions for adults diagnosed with alcohol/drug use disorder conducted in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries published 2004-2023. We grouped interventions according to whether they supplemented or replaced/partially replaced in-person care. We used random effects meta-analyses to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) for relapse, and standardised mean differences (SMD) for days of alcohol/drug use. We appraised outcomes using Cochrane Risk of Bias 2. We identified 34 RCTs (6461 participants) evaluating 42 remote interventions, with diverse therapeutic approaches. Over 70% of outcomes were judged to be at high risk-of-bias. When remote interventions supplemented in-person care, there was a 39% lower odds of relapse [17 interventions; OR 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.46, 0.81; P\u2009=\u20090.001; I Remote interventions which supplement in-person alcohol/drug treatment appear to reduce relapse and days of use. The evidence is less conclusive regarding remote interventions that replace/partially replace in-person care due to a smaller body of evidence and uncertainty (days of use). High risk-of-bias means findings should be interpreted with caution.",

    "title": "Genetic association of SLC6A3 (dopamine transporter) gene polymorphisms with personality disorders and substance abuse disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Personality disorders (PD) are characterized by socially dysfunctional behavioral patterns that affect patients and show higher incidence rates within families. Substance abuse disorders (SAD) are exemplified by extensive and prolonged use of substances, including alcohol, nicotine, or illegal drugs. Genetic predisposition for both PD and SAD has been reported to involve gene variants regulating dopaminergic pathways. Yet, discrepancy among reported results necessitates further elucidation of potential hereditary-related risk factors. Because both disorders impose a societal burden, knowledge on the impact of certain genetic backgrounds on these diseases could help develop evidence-based strategies for efficacious treatment approaches. In the present study a systematic review was performed, and the association between dopamine transporter gene polymorphism (SLC6A3), particularly rs28363170 entailing a 40-bp variable number tandem repeat, and PD as well as SAD was investigated recruiting meta-analysis approach. Initial literature search for PD yielded 1577, from which nine fulfilled eligibility criteria to be used in a meta-analysis including 729 cases and 2113 controls. From the 934 studies retrieved for SAD, only 29 articles with 5221 cases and 4822 controls were used for meta-analysis. A statistically significant association was seen between rs28363170 (for the 9-repeat allele) and PD in European populations according to the co-dominant mode of inheritance. For SAD no statistically significant correlation under any mode of inheritance was observed. There was no indication of time-trend phenomena. Our findings demonstrate the association of SLC6A3 gene polymorphism with PD, thus underling the need to understand neurobiological mechanisms inherent to the above disorders to guide treatment strategies under the perspective of personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "The overdose epidemic continues in the US, with 107\u202f941 overdose deaths in 2022 and countless lives affected by the addiction crisis. Although widespread efforts to train and support physicians to implement medications and other evidence-based substance use disorder interventions have been ongoing, adoption of these evidence-based practices (EBPs) by physicians remains low. To describe physician-reported reasons for reluctance to address substance use and addiction in their clinical practices using screening, treatment, harm reduction, or recovery support interventions. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, medRxiv, and SSRN Medical Research Network was conducted and returned articles published from January 1, 1960, through October 5, 2021. Publications that included physicians, discussed substance use interventions, and presented data on reasons for reluctance to intervene in addiction were included. Two reviewers (L.N., M.C., L.F., J.P., C.S., and S.W.) independently reviewed each publication; a third reviewer resolved discordant votes (M.C. and W.C.). This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and the theoretical domains framework was used to systematically extract reluctance reasons. The primary outcome was reasons for physician reluctance to address substance use disorder. The association of reasons for reluctance with practice setting and drug type was also measured. Reasons and other variables were determined according to predefined criteria. A total of 183 of 9308 returned studies reporting data collected from 66\u202f732 physicians were included. Most studies reported survey data. Alcohol, nicotine, and opioids were the most often studied substances; screening and treatment were the most often studied interventions. The most common reluctance reasons were lack of institutional support (173 of 213 articles [81.2%]), knowledge (174 of 242 articles [71.9%]), skill (170 of 230 articles [73.9%]), and cognitive capacity (136 of 185 articles [73.5%]). Reimbursement concerns were also noted. Bivariate analysis revealed associations between these reasons and physician specialty, intervention type, and drug. In this systematic review of reasons for physician reluctance to intervene in addiction, the most common reasons were lack of institutional support, knowledge, skill, and cognitive capacity. Targeting these reasons with education and training, policy development, and program implementation may improve adoption by physicians of EBPs for substance use and addiction care. Future studies of physician-reported reasons for reluctance to adopt EBPs may be improved through use of a theoretical framework and improved adherence to and reporting of survey development best practices; development of a validated survey instrument may further improve study results.",

    "title": "Parameter Space and Potential for Biomarker Development in 25 Years of fMRI Drug Cue Reactivity: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "In the last 25 years, functional magnetic resonance imaging drug cue reactivity (FDCR) studies have characterized some core aspects in the neurobiology of drug addiction. However, no FDCR-derived biomarkers have been approved for treatment development or clinical adoption. Traversing this translational gap requires a systematic assessment of the FDCR literature evidence, its heterogeneity, and an evaluation of possible clinical uses of FDCR-derived biomarkers. To summarize the state of the field of FDCR, assess their potential for biomarker development, and outline a clear process for biomarker qualification to guide future research and validation efforts. The PubMed and Medline databases were searched for every original FDCR investigation published from database inception until December 2022. Collected data covered study design, participant characteristics, FDCR task design, and whether each study provided evidence that might potentially help develop susceptibility, diagnostic, response, prognostic, predictive, or severity biomarkers for 1 or more addictive disorders. There were 415 FDCR studies published between 1998 and 2022. Most focused on nicotine (122 [29.6%]), alcohol (120 [29.2%]), or cocaine (46 [11.1%]), and most used visual cues (354 [85.3%]). Together, these studies recruited 19\u202f311 participants, including 13\u202f812 individuals with past or current substance use disorders. Most studies could potentially support biomarker development, including diagnostic (143 [32.7%]), treatment response (141 [32.3%]), severity (84 [19.2%]), prognostic (30 [6.9%]), predictive (25 [5.7%]), monitoring (12 [2.7%]), and susceptibility (2 [0.5%]) biomarkers. A total of 155 interventional studies used FDCR, mostly to investigate pharmacological (67 [43.2%]) or cognitive/behavioral (51 [32.9%]) interventions; 141 studies used FDCR as a response measure, of which 125 (88.7%) reported significant interventional FDCR alterations; and 25 studies used FDCR as an intervention outcome predictor, with 24 (96%) finding significant associations between FDCR markers and treatment outcomes. Based on this systematic review and the proposed biomarker development framework, there is a pathway for the development and regulatory qualification of FDCR-based biomarkers of addiction and recovery. Further validation could support the use of FDCR-derived measures, potentially accelerating treatment development and improving diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive clinical judgments.",

A systematic review proposed a conceptual framework characterising alcohol misuse recovery narratives, consisting of eight principal dimensions, each with types and subtypes. The current study aims to apply and extend this preliminary conceptual framework. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect alcohol misuse recovery narratives from adult participants. A two-stage inductive and deductive thematic analysis approach was used to assess the relevance of the dimensions and types included in the preliminary conceptual framework and identify new components. The sample consisted of 11 participants from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds who had previously displayed varying degrees of alcohol misuse. All conceptual framework dimensions (genre, identity, recovery setting, drinking trajectories, drinking behaviours and traits, stages, spirituality and religion, and recovery experience) were present in the collected narratives. Three dimensions were extended by adding types and subtypes. Whilst the existing conceptual framework fitted the collected narratives, a new dimension describing the ",

    "abstract": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have long-term effects on adult health, including unresolved trauma and substance use disorder (SUD). There are hypotheses of a mediating role of emotion regulation. This systematic literature review and narrative synthesis assessed the effectiveness of psychological interventions on emotion regulation, PTSD and SUD symptoms. Searches were conducted using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews methodology. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental psychological interventions published between 2009 and 2019. Study characteristics, results and methodological quality were systematically analysed. Thirteen studies, including nine RCTs, were selected. Integrated SUD and PTSD treatments consisted of Seeking Safety, exposure-based treatment, Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model, and integrated cognitive behavioural therapy. Two studies reported emotion regulation. Five studies found a small to medium positive effect size of psychological interventions on PTSD outcomes. Two studies had a small positive effect size on SUD outcomes and two a small negative effect size. Attrition was high across most studies. Characteristics likely to affect the applicability of the review were described. The review found some evidence of a small inconsistent positive effect of psychological interventions on PTSD outcomes, and no evidence of effect on SUD outcomes. The range of theoretical models was narrow. Overall quality was low with high clinical heterogeneity and missing key information, particularly on emotion regulation, an important transdiagnostic feature. Further research is required to establish interventions that can treat these multiple conditions with a focus on effectiveness, acceptability, and implementation in real life clinical practice.",

    "title": "Got Beer? A Systematic Review of Beer and Exercise.",
    "abstract": "Beer is used to socialize postexercise, celebrate sport victory, and commiserate postdefeat. Rich in polyphenols, beer has antioxidant effects when consumed in moderation, but its alcohol content may confer some negative effects. Despite beer's popularity, no review has explored its effects on exercise performance, recovery, and adaptation. Thus, a systematic literature search of three databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) was conducted by two reviewers. The search resulted in 16 studies that were appraised and reviewed. The mean PEDro score was 5.1. When individuals are looking to rehydrate postexercise, a low-alcohol beer (<4%) may be more effective. If choosing a beer higher in alcoholic content (>4%), it is advised to pair this with a nonalcoholic option to limit diuresis, particularly when relatively large volumes of fluid (>700\u00a0ml) are consumed. Adding Na+ to alcoholic beer may improve rehydration by decreasing fluid losses, but palatability may decrease. These conclusions are largely based on studies that standardized beverage volume, and the results may not apply equally to situations where people ingest fluids and food ad libitum. Ingesting nonalcoholic, polyphenol-rich beer could be an effective strategy for preventing respiratory infections during heavy training. If consumed in moderation, body composition and strength qualities seem largely unaffected by beer. Mixed results that limit sweeping conclusions are owed to variations in study design (i.e.,\u00a0hydration and exercise protocols). Future research should incorporate exercise protocols with higher ecological validity, recruit more women, prioritize chronic study designs, and use ad libitum fluid replacement protocols for more robust conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the serious implications of loneliness on health and wellbeing, little is understood about this experience across people with substance use problems. This systematic review aimed to examine: (i) correlates and predictors of loneliness; (ii) theories underpinning loneliness; (iii) methods employed to measure loneliness; and (iv) loneliness interventions for people with substance use problems. Empirical sources were identified from key databases for all publications preceding February 2019. Overall, 41 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Findings from this review suggest that loneliness is related to poor physical and mental health, substance use, the quality of relationships, stigma and perception of ill treatment by others. Although cognitive theories have proposed cognitive patterns underlying the onset and maintenance of loneliness, they had not been investigated in relation to measurement or intervention efforts. Just one loneliness measure (UCLA Loneliness Scale) is valid for use with this population. Finally, only a single loneliness intervention had been trialled and was not found to be efficacious in reducing loneliness for people with substance use problems. Understanding possible links between loneliness and substance use and how to alleviate loneliness is important for this population in terms of their wellbeing and recovery. Loneliness is prevalent and experienced as problematic among people with substance use problems. Future research should focus on employing longitudinal designs, using validated, multidimensional measures of loneliness and on developing and trialling loneliness interventions that meet the specific needs of people with substance use problems.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of tobacco smoking in pregnancy remains elevated in some disadvantaged populations of women. One group is those who use alcohol and/or other psychoactive substances during pregnancy, with tobacco use prevalence estimates ranging from 71% to 95%. Although effective evidence-based cessation treatments exist, few women with co-occurring substance use problems successfully stop smoking during pregnancy. There is limited information about treatments that specifically target this group and a summary of the available research is required to assist and enhance the development of innovative cessation interventions. This article describes a protocol for a comprehensive review of studies that have trialled behavioural and/or pharmacological tobacco cessation interventions in populations of pregnant women who are nicotine dependent and use alcohol and/or other psychoactive substances. The review will undertake literature searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE and ProQuest databases, as well as the grey literature. Studies of any design methodology will be included if they describe changes to tobacco smoking behaviours in quantitative terms. No restriction on year of publication or published language will apply. Participants include pregnant women of any age, who smoke tobacco, who are seeking or having treatment, or in post-treatment recovery for the use of psychoactive substances. Interventions are any psychological, behavioural or pharmacological treatments used to treat tobacco use. Outcome measures are any that quantitatively report abstinence or reductions in participant tobacco consumption. Key details and tobacco-related outcomes from included studies will be extracted and tabulated before being narratively synthesised. The systematic review protocol has been developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines. Ethics approval is not required.

However, its use may be limited mainly by gastrointestinal adverse effects. Myo-inositol (MI), a well-recognized food supplement, also represents an evidence-based treatment for PCOS women, popular in many countries. Our aim is to provide a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis which compares these two treatments, for their short-term efficacy and safety in PCOS patients. Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). RCTs were identified from 1994 through 2017 using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and ResearchGate. Included studies were limited to those one directly comparing MET to MI on several hormones changes. Standardized mean difference (SMD) or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated. Changes in fasting insulin was the main outcome of measure. Six trials with a total of 355 patients were included. At the end of treatment, no difference between MET and MI was found on fasting insulin (SMD=0.08\u00a0\u00b5U/ml, 95% CI: -0.31-0.46, p=.697), HOMA index (SMD =0.17, 95% CI: -0.53-0.88, p=.635), testosterone (SMD=\u2009-0.01, 95% CI: -0.24-0.21, p=.922), SHBG levels (SMD=\u2009-0.50\u2009nmol/l, 95% CI: -1.39-0.38, p=.263) and body mass index (BMI) (SMD=\u2009-0.22, 95% CI: -0.60-0.16, p=.265). There was strong evidence of an increased risk of adverse events among women receiving MET compared to those receiving MI (RR =5.17, 95% CI: 2.91-9.17, p<.001). No differences were found in the effect of MET and MI on short-term hormone changes.

    "title": "HIV related stigma associated with social support, alcohol use disorders, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among people living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background Stigma is a social phenomenon known to have a negative impact on the lives of people living with HIV (PLWH). However, defining HIV-related stigma (HRS) is difficult because of the intersection it has with structural inequalities, and cultural differences, discrimination by health care providers that measure stigma among PLWH. HIV/AIDS has been characterized as a traumatic experience and PLWH may experience stigma which can cause negative mental health disorders and experiences, including emotional distress, shame, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation. A systematic review of the evidence on the mental disorders of PLWH is currently lacking. This study aimed to analyze the association between HRS and social support, alcohol use disorders and mental health disorders and experiences (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) among PLWH. Methods In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) this study searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of sciences, PsycInfo, SciELO and Cochrane library electronic databases to identify publications between January 1992 and August 2020 that discussed social support, alcohol use disorders, mental health disorders and experiences (i.e., depression and anxiety and suicidal ideation) associated with HRS. Pooled Odds Ratios (ORs) were utilized at a 95% confidence level, and as sampling methods differed between articles pooled estimates used a random effects model. Results Twenty-two studies with 9548 participants met the eligibility criteria. No association was observed between HRS and alcohol use disorders. PLWH who had higher levels of social supports were less likely to report HRS. Participants who had been diagnosed with anxiety were 1.89 times more likely to report HRS, while those diagnosed with depression were 1.61 times more. Respondents who reported suicidal ideation also were 1.83 times more likely to report HRS. Conclusions This meta-analysis supports that HRS has a detrimental association with anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, but social support protects again HRS in PLWH. Applying interventions which focus on the mental health disorders of PLWH may decrease HRS. Provision of social support by practitioners, combined with mental health treatment and assessments, and designing methods to identify stigma at different stages of illness are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Combat deployment increases exposure to potentially traumatic events. Perceived social support (PSS) may promote health and recovery from combat trauma. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize studies investigating the level of PSS and associated factors among (ex-)military personnel who served in the Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts. Five electronic databases were searched in August 2023 and searches were restricted to the beginning of the Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts in 2001. The search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A quality assessment was carried out, and a meta-analysis and narrative synthesis were performed. In total, 35 papers consisting of 19,073 participants were included. Of these, 31 studies were conducted in the United States (US) and 23 were cross-sectional. The pooled mean PSS score was 54.40 (95% CI: 51.78 to 57.01). Samples with probable post-traumatic stress disorder had a lower mean PSS score (44.40, 95% CI: 39.10 to 49.70). Approximately half of the included studies (n\u2009=\u200919) investigated mental health in relation to PSS, whilst only four explored physical health. The most frequently reported risk factors for low PSS included post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety, whilst post-traumatic growth and unit support were protective factors. Higher levels of PSS were generally associated with more positive psychosocial and mental health-related outcomes following deployment. PSS should be targeted in psychosocial interventions and education programmes. Future research should investigate PSS in (ex-)military personnel across other countries and cultures, based on the lack of studies that focused on PSS in countries outside of the US.",

    "abstract": "Associations among general intelligence (IQ), educational attainment (EA), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are not well understood. To examine the relationship between IQ, EA, and AUD risk. The association between IQ and AUD risk was examined in a Swedish national conscription cohort. Potential causality was explored using mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, and the association of polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive performance with AUD diagnosis was assessed. Participant data were obtained from cross-linked Swedish national registers, genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, and the US Yale-Penn cohort. IQ and genetic variants associated with cognitive performance. Hazard ratios (HRs; time-to-event analyses) or odds ratios (ORs) for AUD. Included in this study was a national cohort of 645\u202f488 males, born between 1950 and 1962, from the Swedish Military Conscription Register, of whom 573\u202f855 individuals were included in this analysis. All individuals were aged 18 years at IQ assessment with no substance use disorder diagnosis at conscription, and mean (SD) follow-up time (SD) was 60.5 (7.9) years. Summary statistics from GWAS of cognitive performance (n\u2009=\u2009257\u202f481) and AUD (total\u2009=\u2009753\u202f248; cases\u2009=\u2009113\u202f325) in individuals of European-like genetic ancestry (EUR), with FinnGen AUD GWAS as a replication sample (total\u2009=\u2009500\u202f348; cases\u2009=\u200920\u202f597), were used for MR analyses. PGS analyses were conducted using the data of EUR individuals from the Yale-Penn cohort (n\u2009=\u20095424). IQ at age 18 years was inversely associated with AUD risk in Swedish males (adjusted HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.40-1.47; P\u2009<\u2009.001), adjusting for parental substance use disorder, probands' psychiatric disorders, socioeconomic factors, and birth year strata. MR analyses suggested a causal relationship between lower cognitive performance and AUD risk (\u03b2 [SE], 0.11 [0.02]; P\u2009=\u20092.6 \u00d7 10-12). The mediating role of EA differed between national contexts. Higher cognitive performance PGS were associated with reduced odds of AUD in Yale-Penn participants (OR,\u20090.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89). IQ and cognitive performance have a significant but context-dependent association with AUD risk, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the interplay among genetic factors, cognitive traits, and sociocultural influences on AUD susceptibility.",

Chronic conditions increasingly strain health systems, which are often unprepared for these demands. This study examines the burden of conditions requiring acute versus chronic care, including sequelae. Conditions and sequelae from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 were classified into acute or chronic care categories. Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",

    "title": "Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia across the spectrum of alcohol use disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Insomnia is prevalent among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), potentially undermining treatment and increasing the risk of relapse. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the recommended first-line treatment for insomnia, but its efficacy is not well-characterized in patients across the spectrum of AUD. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the effectiveness of CBT-I in improving insomnia severity and alcohol-related outcomes in adults with heavy alcohol use and/or varying levels of AUD severity and comorbid insomnia. MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched (up to February 2024) to retrieve randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Multilevel meta-analyses were conducted to estimate mean differences over time in insomnia severity, measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), as well as in alcohol craving and alcohol-related psychosocial problems between CBT-I and control groups. For the number of heavy-drinking/abstinent days, incidence rate ratios were estimated. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. Eight RCTs encompassing 426 adults (68.78\u00a0% men) were included. Compared with control conditions, CBT-I resulted in a large reduction of insomnia severity post-treatment [estimated ISI reduction\u00a0=\u00a0-5.51, 95% CI (-7.13 to -3.90)], which was maintained at 1-to-3-month [7 studies; estimate\u00a0=\u00a0-4.39, 95% CI (-6.08 to -2.70)], and 6-month follow-up [4 studies; estimate\u00a0=\u00a0-4.55, 95% CI (-6.77 to -2.33)]. Alcohol-related outcomes were reported less consistently, and no significant differences were found. The included trials were judged to have a low or moderate overall risk of bias for the assessment of all outcomes. CBT-I effectively reduces insomnia severity across the spectrum of AUD, supporting wide implementation in AUD prevention and treatment settings. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42023464612.",

    "abstract": "Call-handlers and dispatchers (CHDs) working in specialized emergency and urgent communication centres are essential in supporting public safety and health. Evidence suggests that these professionals are at increased risk of mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and alcohol abuse among other conditions; however, reliable prevalence estimates remain undetermined. We provide the estimated pooled prevalence for PTSD, depression, anxiety and hazardous drinking among emergency and urgent CHDs globally. We searched 10 electronic databases, grey literature and the Annals of Emergency Dispatch and Response. Eligible studies reported original quantitative data and used validated self-reported measures on the prevalence of mental health conditions of interest (i.e. PTSD, depression, anxiety and alcohol use) within CHD professionals. Three reviewers independently screened results for eligibility. Prevalence estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 16\u00a0857 references were retrieved. From these, 183 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 37 articles were included in this systematic review, and 13 articles provided necessary quantitative information for meta-analyses. In total, 7759 CHDs were considered across nine different countries. The overall pooled prevalence for PTSD was 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.4-24.0%), depression was 28.2% (95% CI 20.7-36.2%), anxiety was 17.2% (95% CI 6.6-31.5%) and hazardous drinking was 17.8% (95% CI 6.9-32.2%). These findings indicate CHDs are at significant risk of mental health problems. Further quantitative and qualitative research is warranted to help understand the psychological risks of working as a CHD and guide appropriate psychological support.",

    "title": "Prenatal alcohol exposure and associations with physical size, dysmorphology and neurodevelopment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a significant public health concern, yet there is no internationally agreed set of diagnostic criteria or summary of underlying evidence to inform diagnostic decision-making. This systematic review assesses associations of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and outcomes of diagnostic assessments, providing an evidence base for the improvement of FASD diagnostic criteria. Six databases were searched (inception-February 2023). Case-controls or cohort studies examining associations between participants with/without PAE or a FASD diagnosis and the domains of physical size, dysmorphology, functional neurodevelopment and/or brain structure/neurology were included. Excluded studies were non-empirical, sample size\u2009<\u200910, PAE determined via biological markers\u00a0only, or no suitable comparison group. Summary data were extracted and associations between outcomes and standardised levels of PAE or FASD diagnosis determined using random-effects meta-analyses. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Of the 306 included studies, 106 reported physical size, 43 dysmorphology, 195 functional neurodevelopment and 110 structural/neurological outcomes, with 292 different outcomes examined. There was a dose-response relationship between PAE and head circumference, as well as measures of physical size, particularly at birth. There was also an association between higher PAE levels and characteristic sentinel facial dysmorphology, as well as many of the current functional neurodevelopmental outcomes considered during diagnosis. However, data were often lacking across the full range of exposures. There was a lack of evidence from studies examining PAE to support inclusion of non-sentinel dysmorphic features, social cognition, speech-sound impairments, neurological conditions, seizures, sensory processing or structural brain abnormalities (via clinical MRI) in diagnostic criteria. GRADE ratings ranged from very low to moderate certainty of evidence. This comprehensive review provides guidance on which components are most useful to consider in the diagnostic criteria for FASD. It also highlights numerous gaps in the available evidence. Future well-designed pregnancy cohort studies should specifically focus on dose-response relationships between PAE and dysmorphology, neurodevelopment and brain structure/neurological outcomes.

    "abstract": "Surrogate markers are increasingly used as primary end points in clinical trials supporting drug approvals. To systematically summarize the evidence from meta-analyses, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and pooled analyses (hereafter, meta-analyses) of clinical trials examining the strength of association between treatment effects measured using surrogate markers and clinical outcomes in nononcologic chronic diseases. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adult Surrogate Endpoint Table and MEDLINE from inception to March 19, 2023. Three reviewers selected meta-analyses of clinical trials; meta-analyses of observational studies were excluded. Two reviewers extracted correlation coefficients, coefficients of determination, slopes, effect estimates, or results from meta-regression analyses between surrogate markers and clinical outcomes. Correlation coefficient or coefficient of determination, when reported, was classified as high strength (r\u2009\u2265\u20090.85 or R2\u2009\u2265\u20090.72); primary findings were otherwise summarized. Thirty-seven surrogate markers listed in FDA's table and used as primary end points in clinical trials across 32 unique nononcologic chronic diseases were included. For 22 (59%) surrogate markers (21 chronic diseases), no eligible meta-analysis was identified. For 15 (41%) surrogate markers (14 chronic diseases), at least 1 meta-analysis was identified, 54 in total (median per surrogate marker, 2.5; IQR, 1.3-6.0); among these, median number of trials and patients meta-analyzed was 18.5 (IQR, 12.0-43.0) and 90\u202f056 (IQR, 20\u202f109-170\u202f014), respectively. The 54 meta-analyses reported 109 unique surrogate marker-clinical outcome pairs: 59 (54%) reported at least 1 r or R2, 10 (17%) of which reported at least 1 classified as high strength, whereas 50 (46%) reported slopes, effect estimates, or results of meta-regression analyses only, 26 (52%) of which reported at least 1 statistically significant result. Most surrogate markers used as primary end points in clinical trials to support FDA approval of drugs treating nononcologic chronic diseases lacked high-strength evidence of associations with clinical outcomes from published meta-analyses.",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 new). Convergent multi-omic approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (for example, GRIA1, GRM8 and CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance and transcription factors (for example, FOXP2, EFNA5 and DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (for example, PCLO, NCAM1 and PDE4B) and endocrine or immune regulators (for example, ESR1, TRAF3 and TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear and threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of mild and major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), also referred to as mild cognitive impairment and dementia, is rising globally. The prevention of NCDs is a major global public health interest. We sought to synthesize the literature on potentially modifiable risk factors for NCDs. We conducted an umbrella review using a systematic search across multiple databases to identify relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Eligible reviews examined potentially modifiable risk factors for mild or major NCDs. We used a random-effects multi-level meta-analytic approach to synthesize risk ratios for each risk factor while accounting for overlap in the reviews. We further examined risk factors for major NCD due to two common etiologies: Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. A total of 45 reviews with 212 meta-analyses were synthesized. We identified fourteen broadly defined modifiable risk factors that were significantly associated with these disorders: alcohol consumption, body weight, depression, diabetes mellitus, diet, hypertension, less education, physical inactivity, sensory loss, sleep disturbance, smoking, social isolation, traumatic brain injury, and vitamin D deficiency. All 14 factors were associated with the risk of major NCD, and five were associated with mild NCD. We found considerably less research for vascular dementia and mild NCD. Our review quantifies the risk associated with 14 potentially modifiable risk factors for mild and major NCDs, including several factors infrequently included in dementia action plans. Prevention strategies should consider approaches that reduce the incidence and severity of these risk factors through health promotion, identification, and early management.",

    "title": "Longer time spent at home during COVID-19 pandemic is associated with binge drinking among US adults",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced and exacerbated stressors (e.g., job loss, poor mental health) for adults across the United States (US) since the first statewide shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020. Limited research has evaluated if, and how, pandemic-related stressors are associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking. Objectives: This analysis aims to identify COVID-19-related stressors associated with changes in alcohol consumption and binge drinking since the outbreak of the coronavirus. Methods: Data were collected on sociodemographics, alcohol consumption, and COVID-19-related stressors (household composition, job status, essential worker, stay-at-home duration, and depression) using a web-based, self-report survey to US adults from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Multivariable logistic and multinomial regression models were used to assess associations between COVID-19-related stressors and binge drinking and changes in alcohol consumption. Among 1,982 participants, 69% were female and 31% male. Results: Thirty-four percent of the sample reported binge drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic. More binge drinkers increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic (60%) than non-binge drinkers (28%). After adjusting for sociodemographics, for every 1-week increase in time spent at home during the pandemic, there was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.06\u20131.34) greater odds of binge drinking. Additionally, binge drinkers with a previous diagnosis of depression and current depression symptoms had greater odds of increased alcohol consumption compared to those reporting no depression (AOR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.73). Conclusion: Specific COVID-19-related stressors are related to alcohol consumption. This highlights the ancillary and unintended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which could have long-lasting population health consequences.",

    "title": "Disentangling the association between alcohol consumption and employment status: causation, selection or confounding?",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Alcohol use constitutes a major health risk and is related to unemployment. However, the direction of this relationship is unclear: unemployment may change drinking patterns (causation), but heavy drinkers may also be more prone to lose their job (selection). We simultaneously examined selection and causation, and assessed the role of residual confounding. Moreover, we paid attention to the subgroup of abstainers and occupationally disabled, often disregarded in the literature. Methods Longitudinal data (three waves collected between 2006 and 2018) of the Lifelines Cohort study from the Netherlands were used (138\u200a875 observations of 55\u200a415 individuals, aged 18\u201360 at baseline). Alcohol use was categorized as \u2018abstaining\u2019, \u2018moderate drinking\u2019 and \u2018binge drinking\u2019 (\u22655 drinks/occasion for male; \u22654 for women). Employment status included occupational disability, short (<6\u2009months) and long-term (\u22656\u2009months) unemployment. Random- and fixed-effects multinomial regression models were fitted in order to account for residual confounding. Reciprocal causality was assessed through generalized structural equation modelling with fixed-effects. Results Long unemployment spells increase the risk for both binge drinking (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.23; 95% CI 0.04\u20130.42) and abstinence (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.27; 95% CI 0.11\u20130.44), and the effects hold after accounting for reciprocal causality and time-constant confounding. Contrarily, the effect of binge drinking on unemployment is weak (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.14; 95% CI \u22120.03 to 0.31). Abstinence is strongly associated with occupational disability (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.40; 95% CI 0.24\u20130.57). Conclusions We find evidence supporting the causation hypothesis (unemployment altering drinking patterns), whereas evidence for the selection hypothesis is weak and mostly confounded by unobserved variables, such as poor health prior to baseline.",

    "title": "Stepping into adulthood during a recession: Did job losses during the Great Recession impact health of young adults?",
    "abstract": "This is the first study to comprehensively examine the impact of job losses during the Great Recession on mental health, physical health, health behavior, and risky health behavior of young adults (ages 18-27). We employ U.S. longitudinal data with individual fixed effects to control for time-invariant factors that may bias the results. We find that job losses during the recession of young adults living by themselves led to increased onset of doctor-diagnosed mental health problems and worries related to jobs. Poorer individuals suffered more from increased worries, obesity, and binge drinking. In contrast, for those living with their parents, job loss of young adults did not negatively affect their own health. Instead, fathers' job losses led to worse mental health, physical health, and health behavior for young adults. Overall, the results suggest that when living on their own, young adults were responsible for their households' livelihood, and consequently, own job losses led to stress and negative health outcomes. However, when living with parents, they were financially reliant on their parents. Therefore, own job losses did not affect health, but job losses of fathers, the primary income earners for most households, worsened the health of young adults.",

Job losses have been widespread, and individuals have experienced significant restrictions on their usual activities, including extended isolation from family and friends. While studies suggest population mental health worsened from before the pandemic, not all individuals appear to have experienced poorer mental health. This raises the question of how people managed to cope during the pandemic. Methods To understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. Results We identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was \u2018thinking positively\u2019 and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences. Conclusion A variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences. This may be useful for helping individuals prepare for future lockdowns or other events resulting in self-isolation.",

    "title": "Fewer Cancer Cases in 4 Countries of the WHO European Region in 2018 through Increased Alcohol Excise Taxation: A Modelling Study",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Prevention of cancer has been identified as a major public health priority for Europe, and alcohol is a leading risk factor for various types of cancer. This contribution estimates the number of cancer cases that could have potentially been averted in 2018 in 4 European countries if an increase in alcohol excise taxation had been applied. Methods: Current country and beverage-specific excise taxation of 4 member states of the WHO European Region (Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, and Sweden) was used as a baseline, and the potential impacts of increases of 20, 50, and 100% to current excise duties were modelled. A sensitivity analysis was performed, replacing the current tax rates in the 4 countries by those levied in Finland. The resulting increase in tax was assumed to be fully incorporated into the consumer price, and beverage-specific price elasticities of demand were obtained from meta-analyses, assuming less elasticity for heavy drinkers. Model estimates were applied to cancer incidence rates for the year 2018. Results: In the 4 countries, >35,000 cancer cases in 2018 were caused by alcohol consumption, with the highest rate of alcohol-attributable cancers recorded in Germany and the lowest in Sweden. An increase in excise duties on alcohol would have significantly reduced these numbers, with between 3 and 7% of all alcohol-attributable cancer cases being averted if taxation had been increased by 100%. If the 4 countries were to adopt an excise taxation level equivalent to the one currently imposed in Finland, an even higher proportion of alcohol-attributable cancers could be avoided, with Germany alone experiencing 1,600 fewer cancer cases in 1 year. Discussion/Conclusion: Increasing excise duties can markedly reduce cancer incidence in European countries.",

Several studies have demonstrated that PAE has long-term consequences on HPA axis functions in the offspring. Reports of some of these studies determined that alcohol-induced epigenetic alterations during fetal development persist in adulthood. However, additional research is necessary to understand the major epigenetic events leading to alcohol-induced teratogenesis on the HPA axis. Our network analysis of GEO datasets identified key pathways in relevance to alcohol-mediated histone modifications, DNA methylation and miRNA involvement associated with PAE-induced alteration of the HPA axis. Our analysis indicated that PAE perturbated the epigenetic machinery to activate corticotrophin-releasing hormone, while it suppressed opioid, glucocorticoid receptors, and circadian clock genes. We hope that our results would be helpful to further understanding and investigating the epigenetic basis of alcohol effect on the HPA axis development.",

    "abstract": "Since natural gas has become a new star in China\u2019s energy mix, a reliable estimation of the price elasticity of natural gas demand is crucial if we are to understand how energy price changes affect natural gas consumption. In this paper, we conduct a Meta-regression analysis to quantitatively synthesize empirical estimates of the price elasticity of natural gas demand reported in previous studies, provide true underlying values, and explain the heterogeneity of the aforementioned estimates. The Fixed-effects model and ordinary least squares (OLS) are applied to estimate the regression models. As a result, this paper reports a mean elasticity of \u22121.521 and 0.410 for the short- and long-run own-price elasticity, separately; \u22120.762 and 0.008 for the short- and long-run cross-price elasticity-coal to natural gas, respectively; 2.122 and 1.884 for the short- and long-run cross-price elasticity-electricity to natural gas, separately; and 2.267 and 1.275 for the short- and long-run cross-price elasticity-oil to natural gas, respectively. Our results suggest that natural gas consumption increases with the decrease of its own and coal prices in the short term and rise of electricity and oil prices. It also shows that almost all heterogeneity can be explained by the type of data, sample period, models of analysis, geographical region, and type of consumer.",

    "title": "Modelling the impacts of volumetric and minimum unit pricing for alcohol on social harms in Australia.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol pricing policies may reduce alcohol-related harms, yet little work has been done to model their effectiveness beyond health outcomes especially in Australia. We aim to estimate the impacts of four taxation and minimum unit pricing (MUP) interventions on selected social harms across sex and age subgroups in Australia. We used econometrics and epidemiologic simulations using demand elasticity and risk measures. We modelled four policies including (A) uniform excise rates (UER) (based on alcohol units) (B) MUP $1.30 on all alcoholic beverages (C) UER + 10 % (D) MUP$ 1.50. People who consumed alcohol were classified as (a) moderate (\u2264 14 Australian standard drinks (SDs) per week) (b) Hazardous (15-42 SDs per week for men and 14-35 ASDs for women) and (c) Harmful (> 42 SDs per week for men and > 35 ASDs for women). Outcomes were sickness absence, sickness presenteeism, unemployment, antisocial behaviours, and police-reported crimes. We used relative risk functions from meta-analysis, cohort study, cross-sectional survey, or attributable fractions from routine criminal records. We applied the potential impact fraction to estimate the reduction in social harms by age group and sex after implementation of pricing policies. All four modelled pricing policies resulted in a decrease in the overall mean baseline of current alcohol consumption, primarily due to fewer people drinking harmful amounts. These policies also reduced the total number of crimes and workplace harms compared to the current taxation system. These reductions were consistent across all age and sex subgroups. Specifically, sickness absence decreased by 0.2-0.4 %, alcohol-related sickness presenteeism by 7-9 %, unemployment by 0.5-0.7 %, alcohol-related antisocial behaviours by 7.3-11.1 %, and crimes by 4-6 %. Of all the policies, the implementation of a $1.50 MUP resulted in the largest reductions across most outcome measures. Our results highlight that alcohol pricing policies can address the burden of social harms in Australia. However, pricing policies should just form part of a comprehensive alcohol policy approach along with other proven policy measures such as bans on aggressive marketing of alcoholic products and enforcing the restrictions on the availability of alcohol through outlet density regulation or reduced hours of sale to have a more impact on social harms.",

    "abstract": "Reducing the alcohol-attributable cancer burden in the WHO European Region is a public health priority. This study aims to estimate the number of potentially avoidable cancers in countries of the WHO European Region in 2019 for three scenarios in which current excise duties on alcoholic beverages were increased by 20%, 50%, or 100%. Mean prices and excise duties for beer, wine, and spirits in the Member States of the WHO European Region in 2020 were used as the baseline scenario. We assumed that increases in excise duties (20%, 50%, and 100%) were fully incorporated into the consumer price. Beverage-specific price elasticities of demand, with lower elasticities for heavy drinkers, were obtained from a meta-analysis. Model estimates were applied to alcohol exposure data for 2009 and cancer incidence and mortality rates for 2019, assuming a 10-year lag time between alcohol intake and cancer development and mortality. Of 180,887 (95%\u00a0Confidence interval [CI]: 160,595-201,705) new alcohol-attributable cancer cases and 85,130 (95% CI: 74,920-95,523) deaths in the WHO European Region in 2019,\u00a05\u00b79% (95% CI:\u00a05\u00b76-6\u00b74) and\u00a05\u00b77% (95% CI: 5\u00b74-6\u00b71), respectively, could have been avoided by increasing excise duties by 100%. According to our model, alcohol-attributable female breast cancer and colorectal cancer contributed most to the avoidable cases and deaths. Doubling current alcohol excise duties could avoid just under 6% (or 10,700 cases and 4,850 deaths) of new alcohol-attributable cancers within the WHO European Region, particularly in Member States of the European Union where excise duties are in many cases very low.

Using block groups as the unit of analysis (N = 571), spatial regression models were estimated to model the relationship between the density of total, on-premise, and off-premise alcohol outlets on MFDV, while accounting for the spatial spillover effect (i.e., alcohol availability and neighborhood characteristics in focal and surrounding block groups). At the focal level, off-premise alcohol outlets are associated with MFDV, net of concentrated disadvantage, lack of health insurance, MFDV lag and total population. Additionally, off-premise alcohol outlet density in surrounding units of analysis is a significant predictor of MFDV. However, total and on-premise densities did not demonstrate a relationship with MFDV.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol outlets have been associated with different social problems, such as crime, violence, intimate partner violence, and child maltreatment. The spatial analysis of neighborhood availability of alcohol outlets is key for better understanding of these influences. Most studies on the spatial distribution of alcohol outlets in the community have been conducted in U.S. cities, but few studies have assessed this spatial distribution in other countries where the drinking culture may differ. The aim of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of alcohol outlets in the city of Valencia, Spain, and its relationship with neighborhood-level characteristics, as well as to examine the influence of alcohol outlet density on alcohol-related police calls-for-service. Spain is characterized by having a \u201cwet\u201d drinking culture and greater social acceptance of drinking compared to the U.S. Data on alcohol outlets between 2010\u20132015 in three categories (off-premise, restaurants and cafes, and bars) were used for the analysis. We used the 552 census block groups allocated within the city as neighborhood unit. Data were analyzed using Bayesian spatiotemporal regression models. Results showed different associations between alcohol outlets categories and neighborhood variables: off-premise density was higher in areas with lower economic status, higher immigrant concentration, and lower residential instability; restaurant and cafe density was higher in areas with higher spatially-lagged economic status, and bar density was higher in areas with higher economic status and higher spatially-lagged economic status. Furthermore, restaurant and cafe density was negatively associated with alcohol-related police calls-for-service, while bar density was positively associated with alcohol-related calls-for-service. These results can be used to inform preventive strategies for alcohol-related problems at the neighborhood-level in Spain or other countries with a wet drinking culture. Future research would benefit from exploring the relationship between alcohol availability and different social problems in cities outside the U.S.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe objective of this analysis was to compare measurement methods-counts, proximity, mean distance, and spatial access-of calculating alcohol outlet density and violent crime using data from Baltimore, Maryland.\n\n\nMETHODS\nViolent crime data (n\u00a0=\u00a011,815) were obtained from the Baltimore City Police Department and included homicides, aggravated assaults, rapes, and robberies in 2016. We calculated alcohol outlet density and violent crime at the census block (CB) level (n\u00a0=\u00a013,016). We then weighted these CB-level measures to the census tract level (n\u00a0=\u00a0197) and conducted a series of regressions. Negative binomial regression was used for count outcomes and linear regression for proximity and spatial access outcomes. Choropleth maps, partial R2 , Akaike's Information Criterion, and root mean squared error guided determination of which models yielded lower error and better fit.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe inference depended on the measurement methods used. Eight models that used a count of alcohol outlets and/or violent crimes failed to detect an association between outlets and crime, and 3 other count-based models detected an association in the opposite direction. Proximity, mean distance, and spatial access methods consistently detected an association between outlets and crime and produced comparable model fits.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nProximity, mean distance, and spatial access methods yielded the best model fits and had the lowest levels of error in this urban setting. Spatial access methods may offer conceptual strengths over proximity and mean distance. Conflicting findings in the field may be in part due to error in the way that researchers measure alcohol outlet density.",

    "abstract": "Importance\nIt is well established that alcohol outlets (ie, places that sell alcohol) attract crime, particularly during late-night hours.\n\n\nObjective\nTo evaluate the association of Maryland Senate Bill 571 (SB571), which reduced the hours of sale for bars/taverns in 1 Baltimore neighborhood from 6 am to 2 am to 9 am to 10 pm, with violent crime within that neighborhood.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis controlled interrupted time series analysis compared the change in violent crime density within an 800-ft buffer around bars/taverns in the treatment neighborhood (ie, subject to SB571) and 2 control areas with a similar mean baseline crime rate, alcohol outlet density, and neighborhood disadvantage score in the City of Baltimore between May 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022. The interrupted time series using Poisson regression with overdispersion adjustment tested whether the violent crime density differed before vs after the policy change in the treatment neighborhood and whether this difference was localized to the treatment neighborhood.\n\n\nExposure\nStatutory reduction of bar/tavern selling hours from 20 to 13 hours per day in the treatment neighborhood.\n\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nThe primary outcome was all violent crime, including homicide, robbery, aggravated and common assault, and forcible rape. Secondary outcomes were homicides and assaults. All violent crime measures summed the monthly incidents within 800 ft of bars/taverns from 8 pm to 4 am. For each outcome, a level change estimated the immediate change (first month after implementation), and a slope change estimated the sustained change after implementation (percent reduction after the first month). These level and slope changes were then compared between the treatment and control neighborhoods.\n\n\nResults\nThe treatment neighborhood included 26 bars/taverns (mean [SD] population, 524.6 [234.6] residents), and the control neighborhoods included 41 bars/taverns (mean [SD] population per census block, 570.4 [217.4] residents). There was no immediate level change in density of all violent crimes the month after implementation of SB571; however, compared with the control neighborhoods, the slope of all violent crime density decreased by 23% per year in the treatment neighborhood after SB571 implementation (annualized incidence rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98; P\u2009=\u2009.04). Similar results were seen for homicides and assaults. Several sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of these results.\n\n\nConclusions and Relevance\nThis study's findings suggest that alcohol policies that reduce hours of sale could be associated with a reduction in violent crimes. Given these findings, SB571 may serve as a model for other cities looking to create safer neighborhoods.",

    "title": "Outlet Type, Access to Alcohol, and Violent Crime",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nWhile there are overwhelming data supporting the association between alcohol outlet density and violent crime, there remain conflicting findings about whether on- or off-premise outlets have a stronger association. This inconsistency may be in part a result of the methods used to calculate alcohol outlet density and violent crime. This analysis uses routine activity theory and spatial access methods to study the association between access to alcohol outlets and violent crime, including type of outlet and type of crime in Baltimore, MD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe data in this analysis include alcohol outlets from 2016 (n\u00a0=\u00a01,204), violent crimes from 2012 to 2016 (n\u00a0=\u00a051,006), and markers of social disorganization, including owner-occupied housing, median annual household income, drug arrests, and population density. The analysis used linear regression to determine the association between access to alcohol outlets and violent crime exposure.\n\n\nRESULTS\nEach 10% increase in alcohol outlet access was associated with a 4.2% increase in violent crime exposure (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.43, 95% CI 0.33, 0.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A 10% increase in access to off-premise outlets (4.4%, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.45, 95% CI 0.33, 0.57, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and LBD-7 outlets (combined off- and on-premise outlets; 4.2%, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.43, 95% CI 0.33, 0.52, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) had a greater association with violent crime than on-premise outlets (3.0%, \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.31, 95% CI 0.20, 0.41, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAccess to outlets that allow for off-site consumption had a greater association with violent crime than outlets that only permit on-site consumption. The lack of effective measures to keep order in and around off-premise outlets could attract or multiply violent crime.",

    "title": "Understanding the impact of urban heat islands on crime: insights from temperature, population density, and green canopy cover",
    "abstract": "Emergent literature suggests that micro- and macro-climates influence criminal behaviour; a complex phenomenon that is still incipient in theory development. This mixed-method research starts with a systematic review of the literature on the theoretical premises that urban heat islands amplify aggressive behaviour and crime. Further, it discusses the potential implications of the relationship between the environment and social outcomes on the design and planning of urban environments. A meta-synthesis was conducted to explain the correlations between patterns of criminal behaviour and thermal (dis)comfort. This correlation is to relate fundamental urban design principles to socially sustainable communities that dissuade violence and crime, and otherwise show poorly designed spaces do propagate criminal behaviour. Cross-validation was undertaken using a case study of Midland, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Data involves population demographics, temperature, and crime statistics relating to Offences against the Person. Analysis focused on homicide, assault, threatening behaviour, and robbery. The findings imply a positive correlation between long-term temperature, crime, population density, and green canopy cover. Variables of climate (e.g., short-to-long-term climate-related stressors) and crime types also show non-linear association. Nonetheless, forecasting the future of violence and trends of crime through attributes or potential impacts of heat and urban canopy cover on the built environment will inform sustainable social development policy, environmental planning, development strategy, designers, and planners. Recommendations are made around these in relation to making urban communities adaptive to the impacts of global warming and future densification.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol-related violence remains a serious social and public health problem in the United States. A large corpus of work suggests a positive statistical relationship between alcohol outlet density and violence. However, questions remain as to how neighborhood violence evolves in response to varying access to alcohol outlets. This paper introduces an approach for analyzing the spatial and temporal dynamics of violence and its association with alcohol outlets by embedding the evolution of assault events and outlet density within a spatially heterogeneous Markov chain framework. This framework enables the exploration of spatiotemporal dynamics of alcohol outlets and violence and controls for potentially confounding impacts and spatial heterogeneity. Using a case study at the block group level in Seattle, Washington, the results of this paper suggest that violence is spatially heterogeneous at the local level and locations with sparsely distributed alcohol outlets are less likely to see an increase in violence when compared to areas with higher densities of outlets. Further, the modeling approach helps identify locations that might \u201ctip\u201d into more violent conditions if more outlets were allowed to operate. This paper concludes with a brief discussion of how the methods and results can help improve the management, licensing, and policy development for alcohol outlets in a community.",

    "title": "Micro-temporal analyses of crime related to alcohol outlets: A comparison of outcomes over weekday, weekend, daytime and nighttime hours.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nCausal relationships between alcohol outlets and crime are inferred from their statistical associations across neighbourhoods. However, many unobserved covariates may confound these effects. Recognising that outlet sales vary by time of day and day of week, we assess whether areas with more bars/pubs, restaurants or off-premise outlets have more crime during days and times when alcohol sales are greatest.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAnnual administrative crime counts, sociodemographic data and other area characteristics of 336 Census block groups in Oakland, California, USA, were related to outlet densities from 2000 to 2015. Bayesian space-time Poisson models were used to measure associations between outlet densities and crime during: (i) weekday daytime; (ii) weekday nighttime; (iii) weekend daytime; and (iv) weekend nighttime periods (four seemingly unrelated equations). Comparisons of parameter estimates across equations provided an assessment of outlet effects on crime across days and times within the same analysis units using the same constellation of confounding covariates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAssault and driving under the influence crime incidents during weekend evening hours were more frequent in Census block group areas with greater numbers of bar/pubs. Burglaries were consistently greater in areas with greater densities of restaurants.\n\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe spatiotemporal signature relating densities of bars/pubs over weekend evening hours to assault and driving under the influence incidents suggests that these outlets are a critical source of these crimes across neighbourhoods. Prevention programs and policies that focus upon specific drinking establishments, days and times may be most effective in reducing assault and impaired driving incidents in neighbourhoods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Time-restricted eating (TRE) effectively improves healthspan, including controlling obesity and improving metabolic health. To date, few meta-analyses have been conducted to explore the effects of various protocols of TRE in participants with overweight/obesity. PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up until October 15, 2022. Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials that investigated the effect of TRE on body weight, body composition and cardiometabolic parameters in participants with overweight/obesity were included. Mean differences of changes from the baseline were used for all analyses between the two groups. Prespecified subgroup analyses based on different protocols of TRE were performed. Twenty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis with 1867 participants. TRE interventions led to significant changes in body weight. When energy restriction strategies were conducted in both the TRE and control groups, the weight-loss effect of TRE remained significant. TRE with 4\u2009\u223c\u20098h feeding window, morning or late eating strategies, led to reduction in body weight and fat mass for at least 8 wk. Hence TRE is a potential and effective approach for weight loss for participants with overweight/obesity. An 8h-TRE intervention with a morning eating strategy for at least eight weeks might be the optimum TRE intervention mode.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nPopulation-level alcohol use data are available from high-income countries, but limited research has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize population-level alcohol use in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\nMETHOD\nDatabases searched included PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and AJOL, without language restrictions. Searches were also conducted in the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) and Google Scholar. Search terms encompassed 'substance' or 'substance-related disorders' and 'prevalence' and 'sub-Saharan Africa'. We included general population studies on alcohol use (including any use, high-risk alcohol use and alcohol use disorders) from 2018 onwards. Prevalence data for alcohol use among sub-Saharan African adolescents (10-17) and adults (18+) were extracted. Analyses included life-time and past 12- and 6-month alcohol use.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe included 141 papers. Among adolescents, the life-time prevalence of alcohol use was 23.3% [95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u200911.3-37.1%], 36.2% (CI\u2009=\u200918.4-56.1%) in the past year and 11.3% (CI\u2009=\u20094.5-20.4%) in the past 6\u00a0months. Among adolescents, 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence were 7.7% (CI\u2009=\u20090.0-27.8%) and 4.1% (CI\u2009=\u20091.4-7.9%), respectively. Among adults, the life-time prevalence of alcohol use was 34.9% (CI\u2009=\u200917.7-54.1%), 27.1% (CI\u2009=\u20095.0-56.4%) in the past year and 32.2% (CI\u2009=\u200919.8-46.0%) in the past 6\u00a0months. Among adults, the 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder and alcohol dependence were 9.5% (CI\u2009=\u20090.0-30.4%) and 4.3% (CI\u2009=\u20090.8-9.8%), respectively. The highest weighted life-time prevalence of alcohol use, 86.4%, was reported in Tanzania among adults. The highest weighted past 6-month prevalence of alcohol use, 80.6%, was found in Zambia among adolescents.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlcohol use patterns vary across countries and subregions within sub-Saharan Africa, and comprehensive population-level data on alcohol use remain scarce in numerous sub-Saharan African countries. The prevalence of alcohol use disorder is common among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "The Ishii Test is recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2), however the use of this technique is still little explored in the clinical context and the scientific literature. We aimed to verify the use of the Test of Ishii in screening for sarcopenia in older adults. We searched three electronic databases and two reviewers independently screened and assessed the studies. Studies with older adults (60 years or more) of both genders, no year or language restriction and which aimed to evaluate sarcopenia using the Ishii Test and another diagnostic criteria were selected. A summary of the ROC curve, sensitivity and specificity were performed using the MedCalc and SPSS software programs, respectively. A total of 3,298 references were identified in the database, 278 by manually searching, and finally 11 studies were included for the review. The screening test showed good sensitivity and specificity in both genders. All studies showed values above the considered value for the Area Under the Curve (AUC) results, without discriminating power (0.500). Four studies used the original values, and five studies developed a new cut-off point. A summary of the AUC curve showed the diamond close to one, indicating that the Ishii test has good performance for screening sarcopenia (I2=83,66%; p<0.001; 95%CI: 69.38 to 91.28 for men; and I2=60.04%; p<0.001; 95%CI: 13.06 to 81.63 for women). The Ishii Test can be considered a useful tool for the early identification of sarcopenia in older adults. However, further studies are still needed to understand the behavior of this screening tool.

Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, as well as websites of regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies without language restrictions until 24 June 2023. Methods Screening, data extraction, coding, and risk of bias assessment were performed independently and in duplicate. Random effects network meta-analyses were conducted for the primary analyses. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants who were pain-free at two hours post-dose and the proportion of participants with sustained pain freedom from two to 24 hours post-dose, both without the use of rescue drugs. Certainty of the evidence was graded using the confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) online tool. Vitruvian plots were used to summarise findings. An international panel of clinicians and people with lived experience of migraine co-designed the study and interpreted the findings. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Double blind randomised trials of adults (\u226518 years) with a diagnosis of migraine according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Results 137 randomised controlled trials comprising 89\u2009445 participants allocated to one of 17 active interventions or placebo were included. All active interventions showed superior efficacy compared with placebo for pain freedom at two hours (odds ratios from 1.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 2.34) for naratriptan to 5.19 (4.25 to 6.33) for eletriptan), and most of them also for sustained pain freedom to 24 hours (odds ratios from 1.71 (1.07 to 2.74) for celecoxib to 7.58 (2.58 to 22.27) for ibuprofen). In head-to-head comparisons between active interventions, eletriptan was the most effective drug for pain freedom at two hours (odds ratios from 1.46 (1.18 to 1.81) to 3.01 (2.13 to 4.25)), followed by rizatriptan (1.59 (1.18 to 2.17) to 2.44 (1.75 to 3.45)), sumatriptan (1.35 (1.03 to 1.75) to 2.04 (1.49 to 2.86)), and zolmitriptan (1.47 (1.04 to 2.08) to 1.96 (1.39 to 2.86)). For sustained pain freedom, the most efficacious interventions were eletriptan and ibuprofen (odds ratios from 1.41 (1.02 to 1.93) to 4.82 (1.31 to 17.67)). Confidence in accordance with CINeMA ranged from high to very low. Sensitivity analyses on Food and Drug Administration licensed doses only, high versus low doses, risk of bias, and moderate to severe headache at baseline confirmed the main findings for both primary and secondary outcomes. Conclusions Overall, eletriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan had the best profiles and they were more efficacious than the recently marketed drugs lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant. Although cost effectiveness analyses are warranted and careful consideration should be given to patients with a high risk cardiovascular profile, the most effective triptans should be considered as preferred acute treatment for migraine and included in the WHO List of Essential Medicines to promote global accessibility and uniform standards of care.

Review methods The search strategy was designed to retrieve cross sectional and prospective studies of the association between long working hours and alcohol use. Summary estimates were obtained with random effects meta-analysis. Sources of heterogeneity were examined with meta-regression. Results Cross sectional analysis was based on 61 studies representing 333\u2009693 participants from 14 countries. Prospective analysis was based on 20 studies representing 100\u2009602 participants from nine countries. The pooled maximum adjusted odds ratio for the association between long working hours and alcohol use was 1.11 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.18) in the cross sectional analysis of published and unpublished data. Odds ratio of new onset risky alcohol use was 1.12 (1.04 to 1.20) in the analysis of prospective published and unpublished data.

    "title": "Exposure to Smartphones and Tablets, Physical Activity and Sleep in Children From 5 to 10 Years Old: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
    "abstract": "Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to verify the association between smartphone/tablet exposure and physical activity and sleep in children from 5 to 10 years old. Data Source: This study followed the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) and included studies that met eligibility criteria based on the \u201cPECO\u201d strategy: participants (children from 5 to 10 years old), exposure (smartphone and tablet use), and outcome (physical activity and sleep). Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria were observational studies published in indexed scientific journals and written in Portuguese, English, and Spanish that verified the association of exposure to smartphones/tablets with physical activity and sleep in children aged 5 to 10 years of both sexes. Studies were considered eligible only if they met the previous criteria. Data Extraction: The search was conducted in January 2023 on databases from electronic journals without the restriction of the period. To meta-analyze were extracted and grouped using models of fixed and random effects, the coefficients Odds Ratio (OR), Beta (\u03b2), Standard Error (SE), and Confidence Intervals of 95% (95%CI). Data Synthesis: 2396 potentially relevant papers were identified, and 17 met the inclusion criteria. Results It can be verified that there was an inverse association between smartphones with physical activity and sleep. Studies indicate that for every additional hour of smartphone and tablet use, sleep can be expected to decrease by an average of 11 minutes (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.11; 95%CI = \u22120.13; \u22120.09). Children using smartphones and tablets were 1.79 times (OR = 1.79; 95%CI = 1.72-1.86) more likely to have shorter sleep duration and 1.53 times (OR = 1.53; 95%CI = 1.41-1.65) more likely to have worse sleep quality. Children with shorter smartphone and tablet usage were 1.19 times more likely to be active (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.03-1.37). Conclusion Children of 5 to 10 years who are more often exposed to smartphones and tablets are prone to have worse quality and quantity of sleep, as well as less practice of physical activity. Health promotion actions can be encouraged based on the results, aiming to reduce the use time of these devices and improve children\u2019s health and quality of life.",

    "title": "Close association between lifestyle and circulating FGF21 levels: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
    "abstract": "Background The impact of lifestyle factors on circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (cFGF21) remains unclear. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between lifestyle factors and cFGF21 levels. Methods We included studies that evaluated the effects of different lifestyles on cFGF21 concentration in adults, which included smoking, exercise, diets, alcohol consumption and weight loss. Random effects models or fixed effects models were used for meta-analysis to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval according to the heterogeneity among studies. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle\u2013Ottawa Scale for cohort studies, the Joanna Briggs Institution Checklist for cross-sectional studies, and the PEDro scale for experimental studies. Results A total of 50 studies with 1438 individuals were included. Overall, smoking, a hypercaloric carbohydrate-rich diet, a hypercaloric fat-rich diet, amino acid or protein restriction, excessive fructose intake and alcohol consumption significantly upregulated cFGF21 levels (p<0.05), whereas fish oil intake and calorie restriction with sufficient protein intake significantly decreased cFGF21 (p<0.05). Compared to the preexercise cFGF21 level, the cFGF21 level significantly increased within 3 hours postexercise (p<0.0001), while it significantly decreased in the blood sampled >6 h postexercise (p=0.01). Moreover, higher exercise intensity resulted in higher upregulation of cFGF21 at 1-hour post exercise (p=0.0006). Conclusion FGF21 could serve as a potential biomarker for the assessment of different lifestyle interventions. When it is used for this purpose, a standard study protocol needs to be established, especially taking into consideration the intervention types and the sampling time post-intervention.

    "abstract": "This will be the first meta-analysis on the efficacy, safety, and side effects of oliceridine on postoperative pain. Our aim with this work is to evaluate the clinical utility of this relatively new substance in a broad postoperative context. Oliceridine is a new so-called bias opioid that is approved for severe pain requiring an opioid. Due to its biased agonism, it is said to have fewer side effects than conventional opioids. This systematic review and meta-analysis will analyze the efficacy, safety, and side effects of oliceridine compared to placebo or morphine in acute postoperative pain for up to 72 hours. In January 2024, an extensive search in various databases will be performed without restrictions for randomized controlled trials with at least single blinding. After data extraction, data will be pooled and meta-analytic calculations performed. A random-effects model will be used. Dichotomous data will be presented as risk ratio and continuous data as standardized mean difference. Dose-dependent side effects will be evaluated with meta-regression. Heterogeneity will be assessed via the Q statistic and prediction interval in case of a sufficient number of included studies. Publication bias will be examined using funnel plot and Duval and Tweedie\u2019s trim and fill method.",

    "title": "0183 Sleep Loss and Emotion: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of over Fifty Years of Experimental Research",
    "abstract": "\n \n \n Studies on the impact of sleep on emotional experiences have rapidly proliferated in recent decades. While evidence suggests that poor sleep serves as a catalyst for the development of emotional difficulties, specific relationships have been difficult to disentangle. Thus, a comprehensive quantitative synthesis is needed to integrate and consolidate findings across this heterogeneous research literature.\n \n \n \n This pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis included studies that experimentally reduced sleep (i.e., total sleep deprivation, partial sleep restriction, or sleep fragmentation) in healthy populations to examine effects on positive affect, negative affect, emotional reactivity, anxiety symptoms, and/or depressive symptoms. In total, 1338 effect sizes from 154 studies were included (total participants N = 5,717; age range = 7-79 years; 50.14% female).\n \n \n \n Random effects models found that all forms of sleep loss resulted in reduced positive affect (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.27 to -1.14), with some evidence that high arousal positive states were most adversely affected. Sleep loss also increased anxiety symptoms (SMD = 0.57 to 0.63) and blunted subjective arousal in response to emotional stimuli (SMD = -0.20 to -0.53). Findings for negative affect, reports of emotional valence in response to emotional stimuli, and depressive symptoms were mixed. Some non-linear effects emerged based on the hours of wakefulness induced or the sleep opportunity provided. Some effects were also moderated by study characteristics, age, and sex, although findings varied by type of sleep loss and emotional outcome. Differences emerged based on type of sleep restricted (i.e., rapid eye movement sleep or slow wave sleep), with greater reports of negative valence in response to emotional stimuli after loss of rapid eye movement sleep (SMD = 0.35, p = .023) compared to loss of slow wave sleep (SMD = 0.09, p = .088).\n \n \n \n This study synthesizes more than 50 years of experimental research to reveal how periods of extended wakefulness, shortened sleep duration, and/or nighttime awakening undermines human emotional functioning and increases risk for psychiatric disorders. Findings provide an integrative foundation for future research on sleep and emotion and elucidate the precise ways that inadequate sleep may impact daytime emotions.\n \n \n \n N/A\n",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims Government alcohol sales data were used to examine whether age 15+\u2009per\u2010capita alcohol consumption (PCAC) (i) changed during COVID\u201019 and (ii) predicted COVID\u201019 infections 2\u20135 weeks later. Design Interrupted time\u2010series analyses were applied to panels of data before and after COVID\u201019 restrictions were introduced in Canada. Setting and participants The populations, aged 15+, of the provinces of Ontario (ON), British Columbia (BC) and Nova Scotia (NS), Canada. Intervention Expansion of home delivery options and hours of trading for liquor stores while restrictions on travel, social and economic activities were imposed by governments during COVID\u201019 from 17\u2009March 2020 until 29\u2009March 2021. Measurements Weekly estimates of (i) age 15+\u2009PCAC using sales data supplied by provincial government alcohol distributors for liquor stores, bars and restaurants, (ii) stringency of public health measures assessed by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and (iii) new COVID\u201019 infections reported by PHAC. Findings PCAC increased by 7.10% (P\u2009=\u20090.013) during the pandemic versus previous years, with increased private liquor store sales partly offset by reduced bar/restaurant sales. Consumption was positively associated with stringency of public health measures. Weekly PCAC was positively associated with new COVID\u201019 infections 2 weeks later (+6.34% for a one drink/week increase, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Lagged associations with COVID\u201019 infections 2 or 3 weeks later were observed for PCAC from all sales channels, with larger effect sizes per standard drink/person/week increase for on\u2010premise outlets (+77.27% week 2, P\u2009=\u20090.009) than government liquor stores (+6.49%, week 2, P\u2009<\u20090.001) or private liquor stores (+7.13%, week\u20094, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Conclusions Alcohol consumption increased in three Canadian provinces during COVID\u201019 to degrees corresponding to the extent of the strictness of measures imposed to prevent viral spread. Increased consumption of alcohol was associated with increased COVID\u201019 infection rates 2 weeks later.",

    "abstract": "Importance\nSuper-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) is defined as status epilepticus (SE) that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anesthetic therapy or recurs on the reduction/withdrawal of anesthesia. Current clinical knowledge of the disease and optimal treatment approach is sparse.\n\n\nObjective\nTo systematically assess clinical characteristics, causes, outcomes, prognostic factors, and treatment approaches for patients with SRSE.\n\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, all studies reporting adult patients (18 years or older) diagnosed with nonanoxic SRSE were considered for inclusion, irrespective of study design. The databases used were MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.org (database inception through May 5, 2022).\n\n\nData extraction and synthesis\nThe study complied with the PRISMA guidelines for reporting, data extraction, and data synthesis. Different tools were used to assess risk of bias. All available data were extracted and missing data were neither imputed nor completed by contacting the study authors.\n\n\nMain outcome and measures\nSuccessful treatment of SRSE, in-hospital mortality, and disability at discharge (estimated modified Rankin Scale).\n\n\nResults\nThe study team identified a total of 95 articles and 30 conference abstracts reporting 1200 patients with nonanoxic SRSE (266 individual patients were available for meta-analysis). They had a mean SRSE duration of 36.3 days, mean age of 40.8 years, and equal sex distribution. Patients with SRSE had a distinct pattern of etiologies where acute cerebral events and unknown etiologies accounted for 41.6% and 22.3% of all etiologies, respectively. Reports of SRSE caused by, eg, alcohol, drugs, or tumors were rare. At discharge, only 26.8% had none to slight disability (none, 16 [8.4%]; nonsignificant and slight disability, 35 [18.4%]). In-hospital mortality was 24.1%. Mortality stabilized after long-term treatment (more than 28 days) but with increased rates of seizure cessation and moderate to severe disability. Established prognostic factors, such as age and etiology, were not associated with in-hospital mortality. Reported treatment with ketamine, phenobarbital, other barbiturates, vagus nerve stimulator, and ketogenic diet were not associated with outcome.\n\n\nConclusion and Relevance\nPatients with SRSE are distinct due to their pattern of care (eg, long-term treatment to younger patients without negative prognostic factors and unknown/nonmalignant etiologies) and their natural course of SE. Very long-term treatment was associated with lower mortality and high odds of cessation of SRSE but increased risk of moderate to severe disability.",

    "title": "Alcohol Consumption and the Physical Availability of Take-Away Alcohol: Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of the Days and Hours of Sale and Outlet Density.",
    "abstract": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were completed studying the effect of changes in the physical availability of take-away alcohol on per capita alcohol consumption. Previous reviews examining this topic have not focused on off-premise outlets where take-away alcohol is sold and have not completed meta-analyses. Systematic reviews were conducted separately for policies affecting the temporal availability (days and hours of sale) and spatial availability (outlet density) of take-away alcohol. Studies were included up to December 2015. Quality criteria were used to select articles that studied the effect of changes in these policies on alcohol consumption with a focus on natural experiments. Random-effects meta-analyses were applied to produce the estimated effect of an additional day of sale on total and beverage-specific consumption. Separate systematic reviews identified seven studies regarding days and hours of sale and four studies regarding density. The majority of articles included in these systematic reviews, for days/hours of sale (7/7) and outlet density (3/4), concluded that restricting the physical availability of take-away alcohol reduces per capita alcohol consumption. Meta-analyses studying the effect of adding one additional day of sale found that this was associated with per capita consumption increases of 3.4% (95% CI [2.7, 4.1]) for total alcohol, 5.3% (95% CI [3.2, 7.4]) for beer, 2.6% (95% CI [1.8, 3.5]) for wine, and 2.6% (95% CI [2.1, 3.2]) for spirits. The small number of included studies regarding hours of sale and density precluded meta-analysis. The results of this study suggest that decreasing the physical availability of take-away alcohol will decrease per capita consumption. As decreasing per capita consumption has been shown to reduce alcohol-related harm, restricting the physical availability of take-away alcohol would be expected to result in improvements to public health.",

    "title": "Executive Control and Striatal Resting-State Network Interact with Risk Factors to Influence Treatment Outcomes in Alcohol-Use Disorder",
    "abstract": "Alterations within mesocorticolimbic terminal regions commonly occur with alcohol use disorder (AUD). As pathological drug-seeking behavior may arise as a consequence of alcohol-induced neuroadaptations, it is critical to understand how such changes increase the likelihood of relapse. This report examined resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) using both a seed-based and model-free approach in individuals in treatment for AUD and how dysregulation of network connectivity contributes to treatment outcomes. In order to provide a mechanism by which neural networks promote relapse, interactive effects of mesocorticolimbic connectivity and AUD risk factors in treatment completers and non-completers were examined. AUD group showed stronger RSFC between striatum, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex than controls. Within the AUD group, non-completers compared to completers showed enhanced RSFC between (1) striatum\u2013insula, (2) executive control network (ECN)\u2013amygdala, and (3) basal ganglia/salience network and striatum, precuneus, and insula. Completers showed enhanced RSFC between striatum-right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, completers and non-completers differed in relationships between RSFC and relapse risk factors, where non-completers exhibited positive associations between craving intensity and RSFC of striatum\u2013insula and ECN\u2013amygdala. These findings provide evidence for interactions between corticolimbic connectivity in AUD and craving and establish an important link between network connectivity and dynamic risk factors that contribute to relapse. Results demonstrate that relapse vulnerability is attributed to craving dysregulation manifested by enhanced connectivity in striato-limbic regions and diminished corticostriatal connectivity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS\nAlcohol taxation and availability restrictions are among the most effective methods for reducing alcohol use and problems, yet may affect demographic subgroups differently. Understanding who responds to specific policies can inform approaches for reducing disparities. We examined how state-level beverage-specific taxes and availability restrictions in the United States are associated with consumption and alcohol-related problems across subgroups defined by gender and race/ethnicity.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS\nData came from the 2000-15 National Alcohol Surveys (n\u00a0=\u00a028\u2009251), computer-assisted telephone cross-sectional surveys of United States residents aged 18+. African Americans and Hispanics were oversampled.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nPrimary outcomes were beverage-specific (beer, wine, spirits and total) volume, DSM-IV alcohol dependence and alcohol-related consequences. Analyses entailed survey-weighted log-log and logistic regressions adjusting for state-level beer tax, spirits tax, government-controlled spirits sales and sales tax; respondent ZIP-code-level density of off-premise beer outlets, off-premise spirits outlets and on-premise bars; respondent individual-level age, marital status, education, employment and income; and fixed effects for wet/moderate/dry US region and year.\n\n\nFINDINGS\nHigher beer tax was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) associated with lower odds of any drinking among white women [odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.98] and lower beer volume (price-elasticity\u00a0=\u00a0-0.40), total volume (price-elasticity\u00a0=\u00a0-0.50) and odds of alcohol-related consequences (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.84) among African American women. Higher spirits tax was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) associated with both lower beer and total volume among Hispanic women (price-elasticities\u00a0=\u00a0-0.73 and\u00a0-\u00a01.04, respectively) and men (price-elasticities\u00a0=\u00a0-1.19 and\u00a0-\u00a00.92, respectively) and decreased wine volume among Hispanic women (price-elasticity\u00a0=\u00a0-0.62). Apparent protective effects of living in a state with government-controlled spirits sales or a neighborhood with lower bar density was greater among white men than other groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe effects of beverage-specific taxes and alcohol availability policies may vary across subgroups, highlighting the importance of considering differential policy impacts in future research and intervention.",

    "title": "Estimating the public health impact of disbanding a government alcohol monopoly: application of new methods to the case of Sweden",
    "abstract": "BackgroundGovernment alcohol monopolies were created in North America and Scandinavia to limit health and social problems. The Swedish monopoly, Systembolaget, reports to a health ministry and controls the sale of all alcoholic beverages with >\u20093.5% alcohol/volume for off-premise consumption, within a public health mandate. Elsewhere, alcohol monopolies are being dismantled with evidence of increased consumption and harms. We describe innovative modelling techniques to estimate health outcomes in scenarios involving Systembolaget being replaced by 1) privately owned liquor stores, or 2) alcohol sales in grocery stores. The methods employed can be applied in other jurisdictions and for other policy changes.MethodsImpacts of the privatisation scenarios on pricing, outlet density, trading hours, advertising and marketing were estimated based on Swedish expert opinion and published evidence. Systematic reviews were conducted to estimate impacts on alcohol consumption in each scenario. Two methods were applied to estimate harm impacts: (i) alcohol attributable morbidity and mortality were estimated utilising the International Model of Alcohol Harms and Policies (InterMAHP); (ii) ARIMA methods to estimate the relationship between per capita alcohol consumption and specific types of alcohol-related mortality and crime.ResultsReplacing government stores with private liquor stores (Scenario 1) led to a 20.0% (95% CI, 15.3\u201324.7) increase in per capita consumption. Replacement with grocery stores (Scenario 2) led to a 31.2% (25.1\u201337.3%) increase. With InterMAHP there were 763 or\u2009+\u200947% (35\u201359%) and 1234 or\u2009+\u200976% (60\u201392%) more deaths per year, for Scenarios 1 and 2 respectively. With ARIMA, there were 850 (334\u20131444) more deaths per year in Scenario 1 and 1418 more in Scenario 2 (543\u20132505). InterMAHP also estimated 10,859 or\u2009+\u200929% (22\u201334%) and 16,118 or\u2009+\u200942% (35\u201349%) additional hospital stays per year respectively.ConclusionsThere would be substantial adverse consequences for public health and safety were Systembolaget to be privatised. We demonstrate a new combined approach for estimating the impact of alcohol policies on consumption and, using two alternative methods, alcohol-attributable harm. This approach could be readily adapted to other policies and settings. We note the limitation that some significant sources of uncertainty in the estimates of harm impacts were not modelled.",

The current study assesses the association between measures of state-level structural racism and alcohol and tobacco use among a national sample of 1,946 Black Americans.\n\n\nMETHODS\nAn existing composite index of state-level structural racism including five dimensions (subscales; i.e., residential segregation and employment, economic, incarceration, and educational inequities) was merged with individual-level data from a national sample dataset. Hierarchical linear and logistic regression models, accounting for participant clustering at the state level, assessed associations between structural racism and frequency of alcohol use, frequency of binge drinking, smoking status, and smoking frequency. Two models were estimated for each behavioral outcome, one using the composite structural racism index and one modeling dimensions of structural racism in lieu of the composite measure, each controlling for individual-level covariates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nResults indicated positive associations between the incarceration dimension of the structural racism index and binge drinking frequency, smoking status, and smoking frequency. An inverse association was detected between the education dimension and smoking status.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nResults suggest that state-level structural racism expressed in incarceration disparities, is positively associated with alcohol and tobacco use among Black Americans.\n\n\nIMPACT\nAddressing structural racism, particularly in incarceration practices, through multilevel policy and intervention may help to reduce population-wide alcohol and tobacco use behaviors and improve the health outcomes of Black populations.",

    "title": "Examining Differences in Substance Use Outcomes and Related Correlates among Transfeminine and Transmasculine Adults Using the 2017 New York State Patient Characteristics Survey",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Transgender persons in the U.S. experience high levels of violence and discrimination which have been linked to adverse substance use outcomes. Despite transgender women\u2019s higher exposure to such deleterious events compared to transgender men, studies have often aggregated both transgender women and men, obfuscating potentially unique differences between these groups. The current study, guided by the Minority Stress Model, examines differences in substance use outcomes and related correlates among transfeminine and transmasculine adults. Methods: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2017 Patient Characteristics Survey of public mental health facilities in the state of New York (N\u2009=\u20091387). Controlling for theoretically relevant factors, logistic regression models were estimated to examine differences between transfeminine and transmasculine adults in alcohol-related disorder (ARD) and drug use-related disorder (DURD) diagnoses, and tobacco use. Correlates of substance use disparities were also examined within gender identity groups. Results: Overall, 35% of participants were documented as using tobacco products whereas 14 and 19% were diagnosed with ARDs and DURDs, respectively. Transfeminine participants were 1.44-times more likely to be diagnosed with ARDs relative to transmasculine adults. Compared to transmasculine and White participants, transfeminine and Black participants were 1.64- and 1.59-times more likely to be diagnosed with DURDs. Conclusions: Recognizing the observed higher hazardous substance use risk among transfeminine and Black participants, findings indicate the potential role of minority stress in health outcomes of stigmatized communities. Our findings emphasize the need for identifying prevention and treatment strategies aimed at mitigating the implications of minority stress.",

    "title": "Variations by Education Status in Relationships Between Alcohol/Pregnancy Policies and Birth Outcomes and Prenatal Care Utilization: A Legal Epidemiology Study",
    "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text. Context: Previous research finds that some state policies regarding alcohol use during pregnancy (alcohol/pregnancy policies) increase low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB), decrease prenatal care utilization, and have inconclusive relationships with alcohol use during pregnancy. Objective: This research examines whether effects of 8 alcohol/pregnancy policies vary by education status, hypothesizing that health benefits of policies will be concentrated among women with more education and health harms will be concentrated among women with less education. Methods: This study uses 1972-2015 Vital Statistics data, 1985-2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, policy data from National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Alcohol Policy Information System and original legal research, and state-level control variables. Analyses include multivariable logistic regressions with education-policy interaction terms as main predictors. Results: The impact of alcohol/pregnancy policies varied by education status for PTB and LBW for all policies, for prenatal care use for some policies, and generally did not vary for alcohol use for any policy. Hypotheses were not supported. Five policies had adverse effects on PTB and LBW for high school graduates. Six policies had adverse effects on PTB and LBW for women with more than high school education. In contrast, 2 policies had beneficial effects on PTB and/or LBW for women with less than high school education. For prenatal care, patterns were generally similar, with adverse effects concentrated among women with more education and beneficial effects among women with less education. Although associations between policies and alcohol use during pregnancy varied by education, there was no clear pattern. Conclusions: Effects of alcohol/pregnancy policies on birth outcomes and prenatal care use vary by education status, with women with more education typically experiencing health harms and women with less education either not experiencing the harms or experiencing health benefits. New policy approaches that reduce harms related to alcohol use during pregnancy are needed. Public health professionals should take the lead on identifying and developing policy approaches that reduce harms related to alcohol use during pregnancy.",

    "title": "Identifying Alcohol Use Disorder With Resting State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data: A Comparison Among Machine Learning Classifiers",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a burden to society creating social and health problems. Detection of AUD and its effects on the brain are difficult to assess. This problem is enhanced by the comorbid use of other substances such as nicotine that has been present in previous studies. Recent machine learning algorithms have raised the attention of researchers as a useful tool in studying and detecting AUD. This work uses AUD and controls samples free of any other substance use to assess the performance of a set of commonly used machine learning classifiers detecting AUD from resting state functional network connectivity (rsFNC) derived from independent component analysis. The cohort used included 51 alcohol dependent subjects and 51 control subjects. Despite alcohol, none of the 102 subjects reported use of nicotine, cannabis or any other dependence or habit formation substance. Classification features consisted of whole brain rsFNC estimates undergoing a feature selection process using a random forest approach. Features were then fed to 10 different machine learning classifiers to be evaluated based on their classification performance. A neural network classifier showed the highest performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79. Other good performers with similar AUC scores were logistic regression, nearest neighbor, and support vector machine classifiers. The worst results were obtained with Gaussian process and quadratic discriminant analysis. The feature selection outcome pointed to functional connections between visual, sensorimotor, executive control, reward, and salience networks as the most relevant for classification. We conclude that AUD can be identified using machine learning classifiers in the absence of nicotine comorbidity.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nData on the neurodevelopmental and associated behavioral effects of light to moderate in utero alcohol exposure are limited. This retrospective investigation tested for associations between reported maternal prenatal alcohol use and psychological, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in substance-naive youths.\n\n\nMETHODS\nParticipants were 9,719 youths (ages 9.0 to 10.9 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Based on parental reports, 2,518 (25.9%) had been exposed to alcohol in utero. Generalized additive mixed models and multilevel cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models were used to test whether prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with psychological, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes, and whether differences in brain structure and resting-state functional connectivity partially explained these associations at baseline and 1-year follow-up, after controlling for possible confounding factors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPrenatal alcohol exposure of any severity was associated with greater psychopathology, attention deficits, and impulsiveness, with some effects showing a dose-dependent response. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure, compared with those without, displayed greater cerebral and regional volume and greater regional surface area. Resting-state functional connectivity was largely unaltered in children with in utero exposure. Some of the psychological and behavioral outcomes at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up were partially explained by differences in brain structure among youths who had been exposed to alcohol in utero.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAny alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with subtle yet significant psychological and behavioral effects in children. Women should continue to be advised to abstain from alcohol consumption from conception throughout pregnancy.",

    "title": "What is special about gambling? A comparison of public discourse on Finnish state monopolies in rail traffic, gambling, and alcohol",
    "abstract": "Finland has one of the last fully monopolistic gambling sectors in Europe. Unlike in most Western European countries, the monopoly is also consolidated and enjoys a wide support as opposed to license-based competition. This paper analyses whether this preference for monopoly provision is due to the particularities of the Finnish society or rather to those of the Finnish gambling sector. We do this by comparing public discourses in media texts (N=143) from 2014 to 2017 regarding monopolies operating in alcohol retail, rail traffic and gambling sectors. The results show that gambling appears to be special even in the Finnish national context. While the Finnish alcohol retail and railroad traffic markets have been liberalised during the study period, the gambling monopoly has been concurrently strengthened despite similar political and international pressures towards dismantling. The discussion suggests that the differing outcomes reflect the varying positions of monopolies, their stakeholders and the justifications put forward. Intertwined stakeholder interests in the gambling sector appear to amplify consensus politics and set gambling apart from the other cases.",

    "abstract": "Substance use disorders are characterized by inhibition deficits related to disrupted connectivity in white matter pathways, leading via interaction to difficulties in resisting substance use. By combining neuroimaging with smartphone\u2010based ecological momentary assessment (EMA), we questioned how biomarkers moderate inhibition deficits to predict use. Thus, we aimed to assess white matter integrity interaction with everyday inhibition deficits and related resting\u2010state network connectivity to identify multi\u2010dimensional predictors of substance use. Thirty\u2010eight patients treated for alcohol, cannabis or tobacco use disorder completed 1\u2009week of EMA to report substance use five times and complete Stroop inhibition testing twice daily. Before EMA tracking, participants underwent resting state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scanning. Regression analyses were conducted between mean Stroop performances and whole\u2010brain fractional anisotropy (FA) in white matter. Moderation testing was conducted between mean FA within significant clusters as moderator and the link between momentary Stroop performance and use as outcome. Predictions between FA and resting\u2010state connectivity strength in known inhibition\u2010related networks were assessed using mixed modelling. Higher FA values in the anterior corpus callosum and bilateral anterior corona radiata predicted higher mean Stroop performance during the EMA week and stronger functional connectivity in occipital\u2013frontal\u2013cerebellar regions. Integrity in these regions moderated the link between inhibitory control and substance use, whereby stronger inhibition was predictive of the lowest probability of use for the highest FA values. In conclusion, compromised white matter structural integrity in anterior brain systems appears to underlie impairment in inhibitory control functional networks and compromised ability to refrain from substance use.",

    "title": "Deep Learning for Identification of Alcohol-Related Content on Social Media (Reddit and Twitter): Exploratory Analysis of Alcohol-Related Outcomes",
    "abstract": "Background Many social media studies have explored the ability of thematic structures, such as hashtags and subreddits, to identify information related to a wide variety of mental health disorders. However, studies and models trained on specific themed communities are often difficult to apply to different social media platforms and related outcomes. A deep learning framework using thematic structures from Reddit and Twitter can have distinct advantages for studying alcohol abuse, particularly among the youth in the United States. Objective This study proposes a new deep learning pipeline that uses thematic structures to identify alcohol-related content across different platforms. We apply our method on Twitter to determine the association of the prevalence of alcohol-related tweets with alcohol-related outcomes reported from the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, Centers for Disease Control Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, county health rankings, and the National Industry Classification System. Methods The Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers neural network learned to classify 1,302,524 Reddit posts as either alcohol-related or control subreddits. The trained model identified 24 alcohol-related hashtags from an unlabeled data set of 843,769 random tweets. Querying alcohol-related hashtags identified 25,558,846 alcohol-related tweets, including 790,544 location-specific (geotagged) tweets. We calculated the correlation between the prevalence of alcohol-related tweets and alcohol-related outcomes, controlling for confounding effects of age, sex, income, education, and self-reported race, as recorded by the 2013-2018 American Community Survey. Results Significant associations were observed: between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and alcohol consumption (P=.01) and heavy drinking (P=.005) but not binge drinking (P=.37), self-reported at the metropolitan-micropolitan statistical area level; between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and self-reported excessive drinking behavior (P=.03) but not motor vehicle fatalities involving alcohol (P=.21); between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and the number of breweries (P<.001), wineries (P<.001), and beer, wine, and liquor stores (P<.001) but not drinking places (P=.23), per capita at the US county and county-equivalent level; and between alcohol-hashtagged tweets and all gallons of ethanol consumed (P<.001), as well as ethanol consumed from wine (P<.001) and liquor (P=.01) sources but not beer (P=.63), at the US state level. Conclusions Here, we present a novel natural language processing pipeline developed using Reddit\u2019s alcohol-related subreddits that identify highly specific alcohol-related Twitter hashtags. The prevalence of identified hashtags contains interpretable information about alcohol consumption at both coarse (eg, US state) and fine-grained (eg, metropolitan-micropolitan statistical area level and county) geographical designations. This approach can expand research and deep learning interventions on alcohol abuse and other behavioral health outcomes.",

    "title": "Intended vs Actual Access to Care: Impact of Healthcare Consolidation on Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes.",
    "abstract": "The Affordable Care Act was intended principally to increase healthcare insurance coverage to uninsured Americans. Ostensibly, 40 million people obtained coverage. However, American maternal mortality has significantly worsened. The overall health curve in conservative leaning states is shifted downward in comparison to liberal ones including COVID mortality, maternal mortality, neonatal mortality, life expectancy, heart disease, pulmonary, and diabetic deaths, obesity, smoking, suicides, and alcohol related auto deaths. Here, we focus on insurance coverage issues related to those outcomes and market alterations produced by ACA legislation and regulatory actions that may or may not have had unintended consequences. Using authoritative national public databases, we analyzed 18 health status metrics in the context of MCO market consolidation and ACO penetration fueled by the Medicaid expansion. We ranked states from best statistics to worst incorporating 10 measures of health access including: hospital beds, patients without examination for over a year, and incidence of maternity care deserts. There is considerable variation in the US for both health care status and access. Our data show these are highly correlated (r\u00b2 = .47, p<.01). States with the best outcomes have the best access. States with highest health care metrics and health care access were all traditional liberal \"blue states\" with greater infrastructure and insurance coverage. Hospital and clinic realignments created under the ACA appear to have worsened the health care of women and children in the US, particularly for patients of color. Health care status and access to services are highly correlated. States allocating more resources for health care have better outcomes. Monopoly exemptions under ACA are temporally and statistically correlated with worsening of maternal outcomes across all geographic regions where control and consolidation was permitted or encouraged. Maternity care deserts have significantly disadvantaged women of color and working-class families in rural and urban zones. Further exacerbating the problem is the reduction of physician independence both within and outside of hospital systems.",

    "abstract": "Research has found that policies that single out pregnant people's alcohol consumption are mostly ineffective. Identifying alternative approaches - for example, general population alcohol policies - that can reduce adverse effects of pregnant people's alcohol consumption is essential. Here, we examine how U.S. state-level alcohol policies regarding grocery store and gas station sales, Sunday sales, Blood Alcohol Concentration limits for driving, and government monopolies relate to birth outcomes. Outcome data came from the 1972-2019 U.S. Vital Statistics System birth certificates (N\u2009=\u2009160,538,939 live singleton births). Primary outcomes were low birthweight (<2,500 grams) and preterm birth (<37 weeks). Fully adjusted models included state and year fixed effects, state-specific time trends, and maternal- and state-level covariates with standard errors clustered by state. The only significant, robust associations between policies and outcomes were for government monopolies. In fully adjusted models, having a government monopoly on spirits or on both spirits and wine retail sales (vs. none) were each related to lower odds of low birthweight births (aOR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.95; aOR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.98 respectively). Having a government monopoly on spirits sales was also significantly related to lower odds of preterm births (aOR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.00). Government monopolies on spirits and wine relate to better birth outcomes. Findings underscore the importance of maintaining state government monopolies on spirits and wine as a strategy for protecting against adverse effects of pregnant people's drinking.",

    "abstract": "Evidence of the effect of limiting off-premises alcohol trading hours is still scarce. This study tested the effect of a small extension in trading hours on alcohol sales in alcohol monopoly outlets in Norway. The extension of trading hours was implemented within a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial design. Eligible state monopoly outlets (n\u2009=\u2009229) were clustered into trade districts (n\u2009=\u200962), which were block-randomized to one of three sequences regarding date of implementation: 1 September 2020 (n\u2009=\u200921 districts, 82 outlets), 1 December 2020 (n\u2009=\u200921 districts, 73 outlets) and 1 March 2021 (n\u2009=\u200920 districts, 74 outlets). Outcomes were followed-up for a 1-year period. Study participants were state monopoly outlets in urban and rural trade districts in all parts of Norway. Monthly alcohol sales in litres of pure alcohol per trade district and per outlet were measured from March 2020 to March 2022 (primary outcome). We applied a linear mixed-effect model with two-way fixed effects within a difference-in-difference framework. As a robustness check we considered the effects of cross-border trade and effects in subgroups of outlets. Trading hours in monopoly outlets were extended by 1\u2009hour on Saturdays. The extension was permanent. Pre-intervention periods and not-yet-treated units served as control conditions. We did not find a statistically significant effect of the small extension in trading hours on monthly alcohol sales (i) per trade district [average treatment effect: -185.5\u00a0litres, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u2009-1159.9, 788.9] and (ii) per outlet (-35.3\u00a0litres, 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-142.1, 72.0). These findings were consistent across estimation methods and model specifications. There is no clear evidence that a small extension in off-premises trading hours affected alcohol sales in monopoly outlets in Norway.",

    "title": "The prevalence of gambling and problematic gambling: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Gambling behaviours have become of increased public health interest, but data on prevalence remain scarce. In this study, we aimed to estimate for adults and adolescents the prevalence of any gambling activity, the prevalence of engaging in specific gambling activities, the prevalence of any risk gambling and problematic gambling, and the prevalence of any risk and problematic gambling by gambling activity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We systematically searched for peer-reviewed literature (on MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo) and grey literature to identify papers published between Jan 1, 2010, and March 4, 2024. We searched for any gambling, including engagement with individual gambling activities, and problematic gambling data among adults and adolescents. We included papers that reported the prevalence or proportion of a gambling outcome of interest. We excluded papers of non-original data or based on a biased sample. Data were extracted into a bespoke Microsoft Access database, with the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool used to identify the risk of bias for each sample. Representative population survey estimates were firstly meta-analysed into country-level prevalence estimates, using metaprop, of any gambling, any risk gambling, problematic gambling, and by gambling activity. Secondly, population-weighted regional-level and global estimates were generated for any gambling, any risk gambling, problematic gambling, and specific gambling activity. This review is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021251835). We screened 3692 reports, with 380 representative unique samples, in 68 countries and territories. Overall, the included samples consisted of slightly more men or male individuals, with a mean age of 29\u00b772 years, and most samples identified were from high-income countries. Of these samples, 366 were included in the meta-analysis. Globally, 46\u00b72% (95% CI 41\u00b77-50\u00b78) of adults and 17\u00b79% (14\u00b78-21\u00b72) of adolescents had gambled in the past 12 months. Rates of gambling were higher among men (49\u00b71%; 45\u00b75-52\u00b76) than women (37\u00b74%; 32\u00b70-42\u00b75). Among adults, 8\u00b77% (6\u00b76-11\u00b73) were classified as engaging in any risk gambling, and 1\u00b741% (1\u00b706-1\u00b784) were engaging in problematic gambling. Among adults, rates of problematic gambling were greatest among online casino or slots gambling (15\u00b78%; 10\u00b77-21\u00b76). There were few data reported on any risk and problematic gambling among adolescent samples. Existing evidence suggests that gambling is prevalent globally, that a substantial proportion of the population engage in problematic gambling, and that rates of problematic gambling are greatest among those gambling on online formats. Given the growth of the online gambling industry and the association between gambling and a range of public health harms, governments need to give greater attention to the strict regulation and monitoring of gambling globally.

    "title": "Relationships Between Alcohol Policies and Infant Morbidities and Injuries.",
    "abstract": "Previous research has found that policies specifically focused on pregnant people's alcohol use are largely ineffective. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the relationships between general population policies regulating alcohol physical availability and outcomes related to pregnant people's alcohol use, specifically infant morbidities and injuries. Outcome data were obtained from Merative MarketScan, a longitudinal commercial insurance claims data set. Policy data were obtained from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's Alcohol Policy Information System, the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, and Liquor Handbooks and merged using policies in effect during the estimated year of conception. Relationships between state-level policies regulating sites, days/hours, and government monopoly of liquor sales and infant morbidities and injuries were examined. Analyses used logistic regression with individual controls, fixed effects for state and year, state-specific time trends, and SEs clustered by state. The study analysis was conducted from 2021 to 2023. The analytic sample included 1,432,979 infant-birthing person pairs, specifically people aged 25-50 years who gave birth to a singleton between 2006 and 2019. A total of 3.1% of infants had a morbidity and 2.1% of infants had an injury. State government monopoly on liquor sales was associated with reduced odds of infant morbidities and injuries, whereas gas station liquor sales were associated with increased odds of infant morbidities and injuries. Allowing liquor sales after 10PM was associated with increased odds for infant injuries. No effect was found for allowing liquor sales in grocery stores or on Sundays. Findings suggest that limiting alcohol availability for the general population may help reduce adverse infant outcomes related to pregnant people's alcohol use.",

    "abstract": "The regular use of cannabis during adolescence has been associated with a number of negative life outcomes, including psychopathology and cognitive impairments. However, the exact molecular mechanisms that underlie these outcomes are just beginning to be understood. Moreover, very little is known about the spatio-temporal molecular changes that occur following cannabinoid exposure in adolescence. To understand these changes, we exposed mid-adolescent male rats to a synthetic cannabinoid (WIN 55,212-2 mesylate; WIN) and, following drug abstinence through late adolescence, we subjected the synaptosomal fractions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to proteomic analyses. A total of N = 487 differentially expressed proteins were found in WIN-exposed animals compared to controls. Gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment of terms related to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurotransmitter system. Among the top differentially expressed proteins was the synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (SYNGAP1). Using Western blotting experiments, we found that the WIN-induced upregulation of SYNGAP1 was spatio-temporal in nature, arising only in the synaptosomal fractions (not in the cytosol) and only following prolonged drug abstinence (not on abstinence day 1). Moreover, the SYNGAP1 changes were found to be specific to WIN-exposure in adolescence and not adulthood. Adolescent animals exposed to a natural cannabinoid (\u0394",

    "abstract": "International drink-driving policy research generally focuses on aggregate outcomes (e.g., rates of crashes, fatalities) without emphasizing secondhand alcohol-related vehicular harms. In contrast, we investigate associations between drink-driving policies and harms involving another driver's impairment. Alcohol's harms to others (AHTO) survey data from 12 countries (analytic N\u00a0=\u00a029,616) were linked to national alcohol policy data from the World Health Organization. We examined separately associations of two 12-month driving-related AHTOs (passenger with an impaired driver; vehicular crash involving someone else's drink driving) with 3 national drinking-driving policies-legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits, use of random breath testing, use of sobriety checkpoints, and comprehensive penalties for drink-driving (community service, detention, fines, ignition interlocks, license suspension/revocation, mandatory alcohol treatment, vehicle impoundment, and penalty point system), plus 2 alcohol tax variables (having excise taxes and value-added tax [VAT] rate). Multilevel logistic regression addressed clustering of individuals within countries and subnational regions, while adjusting for individuals' gender, age, marital status, risky drinking, and regional drinking culture (% male risky drinkers in sub-national region). Controlling for national-, regional-, and individual-level covariates, comprehensive penalties were significantly and negatively associated with both outcomes; other vehicular policy variables were not significantly associated with either outcome. A society's VAT rate was negatively associated with riding with a drunk driver. Regional male drinking culture was positively associated with riding with an impaired driver, but was not significantly associated with being in a vehicular crash due to someone else's drinking. In both models, being male, being younger, and engaging in risky drinking oneself each were positively associated with vehicular harms due to someone else's drinking. Although results are associational and not causal, comprehensive penalties may be promising policies for mitigating driving-related harms due to another drinker. Higher VAT rate might reduce riding with a drunk driver.",

    "title": "How many alcohol-attributable deaths and hospital admissions could be prevented by alternative pricing and taxation policies? Modelling impacts on alcohol consumption, revenues and related harms in Canada.",
    "abstract": "In 2017, Canada increased alcohol excise taxes for the first time in over three decades. In this article, we describe a model to estimate various effects of additional tax and price policies that are predicted to improve health outcomes. We obtained alcohol sales and taxation data for 2016/17 for all Canadian jurisdictions from Statistics Canada and product-level sales data for British Columbia. We modelled effects of alternative price and tax policies - revenue-neutral taxes, inflation-adjusted taxes and minimum unit prices (MUPs) - on consumption, revenues and harms. We used published price elasticities to estimate impacts on consumption and revenue and the International Model for Alcohol Harms and Policies (InterMAHP) to estimate impacts on alcohol-attributable mortality and morbidity. Other things being equal, revenue-neutral alcohol volumetric taxes (AVT) would have minimal influence on overall alcohol consumption and related harms. Inflation-adjusted AVT would result in 3.83% less consumption, 329 fewer deaths and 3762 fewer hospital admissions. A MUP of $1.75 per standard drink (equal to 17.05mL ethanol) would have reduced consumption by 8.68% in 2016, which in turn would have reduced the number of deaths by 732 and the number of hospitalizations by 8329 that year. Indexing alcohol excise taxes between 1991/92 and 2016/17 would have resulted in the federal government gaining approximately $10.97 billion. We estimated this could have prevented 4000-5400 deaths and 43 000-56 000 hospitalizations. Improved public health outcomes would be made possible by (1) increasing alcohol excise tax rates across all beverages to compensate for past failures to index rates, and (2) setting a MUP of at least $1.75 per standard drink. While reducing alcohol-caused harms, these tax policies would have the added benefit of increasing federal government revenues. En 2017, le Canada a augment\u00e9 les taxes d\u2019accise sur l\u2019alcool pour la premi\u00e8re fois depuis plus de 30 ans. Dans cet article, nous offrons un mod\u00e8le permettant d\u2019estimer les divers effets de politiques augmentant les taxes et les prix dans le but d\u2019am\u00e9liorer les r\u00e9sultats en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9. Nous avons obtenu de Statistique Canada les donn\u00e9es 2016\u00ad2017 sur les ventes de boissons alcoolis\u00e9es et leur taxation dans l\u2019ensemble des provinces et des territoires au Canada, ainsi que les donn\u00e9es sur les ventes par produit en ColombieBritannique. Nous avons mod\u00e9lis\u00e9 les effets de diverses politiques fiscales et d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des prix \u2012 taxes sans incidence sur les recettes gouvernementales, taxes corrig\u00e9es en fonction de l\u2019inflation et d\u2019un prix unitaire minimum (PUM) \u2012 sur la consommation, les revenus et les m\u00e9faits. Nous avons utilis\u00e9 les \u00e9lasticit\u00e9s de prix publi\u00e9es pour estimer les effets sur la consommation et les revenus, et le mod\u00e8le international en mati\u00e8re de m\u00e9faits et de politiques li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alcool (InterMAHP) pour estimer les effets sur la mortalit\u00e9 et la morbidit\u00e9 attribuables \u00e0 l\u2019alcool. Toutes choses \u00e9gales par ailleurs, les taxes volum\u00e9triques sur l\u2019alcool (TVA) sans incidence sur les recettes gouvernementales auraient eu une influence minime sur la consommation globale d\u2019alcool et les m\u00e9faits qui y sont li\u00e9s. Les TVA corrig\u00e9es en fonction de l\u2019inflation auraient entra\u00een\u00e9 une baisse de 3,83 % de la consommation, ce qui se serait accompagn\u00e9 d\u2019une r\u00e9duction du nombre des d\u00e9c\u00e8s de 329 et une diminution du nombre d\u2019admissions \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital de 3762. En 2016, un prix unitaire minimum de 1,75 $ par verre standard (soit 17,05 ml d\u2019\u00e9thanol) aurait permis de r\u00e9duire la consommation de 8,68 %, ce qui aurait conduit \u00e0 une diminution du nombre de d\u00e9c\u00e8s de 732 et du nombre d\u2019hospitalisations de 8 329. Indexer les taxes d\u2019accise sur l\u2019alcool entre 1991\u00ad 1992 et 2016\u00ad2017 aurait fait gagner au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral environ 10,97 milliards de dollars suppl\u00e9mentaires. Selon nos estimations, la situation aurait permis d\u2019\u00e9viter entre 4000 et 5400 d\u00e9c\u00e8s de plus et entre 43000 et 56000 hospitalisations suppl\u00e9mentaires. L\u2019am\u00e9lioration des r\u00e9sultats en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 publique aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 (1) l\u2019augmentation des taux de la taxe d\u2019accise sur l\u2019alcool pour toutes les boissons afin de compenser la non\u00adindexation pass\u00e9e des taux et (2) la fixation d\u2019un PUM d\u2019au moins 1,75 $ par verre standard. La mise en \u0153uvre de ces politiques permettrait aujourd\u2019hui de r\u00e9duire les m\u00e9faits dus \u00e0 l\u2019alcool tout en augmentant les recettes f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. We modelled the impacts of alternative pricing and taxation policies on alcohol harms for Canada in 2016. A minimum unit price (MUP) of $1.75 per standard drink would have reduced the number of deaths across Canada in 2016 by 732 and hospitalizations by 8329. Compensating for past failures to adjust alcohol excise tax rates with inflation would have decreased the annual number of deaths by 329 and hospitalizations by 3762. Indexing alcohol excise taxes between 1991 and 2017 would resulted in the federal government gaining approximately $10.97 billion. Excise taxes calculated per unit of alcohol, adjusted for inflation and combined with an MUP, would have significantly reduced alcohol consumption, and consequently alcohol-attributable deaths and hospitalizations. Nous avons mod\u00e9lis\u00e9 les effets de diverses politiques fiscales et d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des prix sur les m\u00e9faits de l\u2019alcool au Canada en 2016. Un prix unitaire minimum (PUM) de 1,75 $ par consommation standard aurait r\u00e9duit le nombre de d\u00e9c\u00e8s au Canada en 2016 de 732, et le nombre d\u2019hospitalisations de 8329. La compensation de la non\u00adindexation pass\u00e9e des taux de la taxe d\u2019accise sur l\u2019alcool \u00e0 l\u2019inflation aurait r\u00e9duit de 329 le nombre annuel de d\u00e9c\u00e8s et de 3762 celui des hospitalisations.

    "abstract": "Alcohol labels are one strategy for raising consumer awareness about the negative consequences of alcohol, but evidence to inform labels is limited. This quasi-experimental study sought to test the real-world impact of strengthening health messages on alcohol container labels on consumer attention, message processing (reading, thinking, and talking with others about labels), and self-reported drinking. Alcohol labels with a cancer warning, national drinking guidelines, and standard drink information were implemented in the intervention site, and usual labelling practices continued in the comparison site. Changes in key indicators of label effectiveness were assessed among a cohort of adult drinkers in both the intervention and comparison sites using three waves of surveys conducted before and at two time-points after the alcohol label intervention. Generalized Estimating Equations with difference-in-difference terms were used to examine the impact of the label intervention on changes in outcomes. Strengthening health messages on alcohol container labels significantly increased consumer attention to [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR)=17.2, 95%CI:8.2,36.2] and processing of labels (e.g., reading labels: AOR=2.6, 95%CI:1.8,3.7), and consumer reports of drinking less due to the labels (AOR=3.7, 95%CI: 2.0,7.0). Strengthening health messages on alcohol containers can achieve their goal of attracting attention, deepening engagement, and enhancing motivation to reduce alcohol use. Strengthening alcohol labelling policies should be a priority for alcohol control globally.",

    "abstract": "Washington Initiative 1183 (I-1183), a 2012 law that privatized liquor retail sales and distribution in Washington State, USA, has had two opposing effects on liquor purchases: it has increased access to liquor and imposed new fees on retailers and distributors. This study aimed to estimate the effect of I-1183 on monthly alcohol purchases during the post-I-1183 period (June 2012-December 2014) compared with the pre-I-1183 period (January 2010-May 2012). DIFFERENCES-IN-DIFFERENCES STUDY: Setting and participants The study included households participating in the Nielsen Consumer Panel Dataset living in metropolitan and surrounding areas in Washington State and 10 control states. Measurements Outcomes were alcohol purchases by type (ounces of liquor, wine, beer and total alcohol or ethanol). Findings I-1183 was associated with a 6.34-ounce (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a 2.01-ounce (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) increase in monthly liquor and ethanol purchases, respectively, per household in the post-policy period spanning 31\u00a0months compared with monthly purchases in control states. In a longitudinal subgroup analysis, low and moderate alcohol purchasers increased monthly purchases of ethanol and high purchasers decreased purchases of ethanol. Conclusions Enacting 'Washington Initiative 1183', a law that privatized sale and distribution of liquor and imposed new fees on retailers and distributors, appears to have been associated with an approximate 82% increase in monthly liquor purchases and 26% increase in monthly ethanol purchases by households in metropolitan and surrounding areas in Washington State, USA.",

    "abstract": "\n Background: Policymaking environments are multi-centric by necessity and design. Alcohol premises licensing is governed by Scottish legislation, which also allows for local autonomy.Aims and objectives: To describe the obstacles faced by local public health actors in seeking to influence the alcohol premises licensing system in Scotland as an example of local advocacy efforts in multi-centric policymaking.Methods: Snowball sampling identified and recruited 12 public health actors who were actively seeking to influence alcohol premises licensing, along with a national key informant. In-depth interviews (n=13) discussed challenges experienced and perceptions of best strategies for success. Interviews (69m average) were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using an inductive framework approach.Findings: Most interviewees operated in local premises licensing arenas, influencing national legislation only through intermediaries. Challenges to engagement included: unfamiliar conventions, stakeholders and decision-making cultures, resources, data gaps, and licensing boards\u2019 prioritisation of economic growth. Their preferred solution was a strengthening of national legislation to constrain local autonomy, but they adapted their strategies to the challenges faced.Discussion and conclusion: The adoption of a particular objective in national government (a public health objective for alcohol licensing) may not remove the need for effective local advocacy in a multi-centric system. Local policymakers have their own conventions, processes and views on evidence, and successful advocacy may involve diverse strategies and relationship building over time. Practitioners advocating policy change may benefit from a better understanding of prior research on how to bring about such change; scholars of such processes could better engage with this audience.Key messagesA commitment to a policy outcome in national legislation does not guarantee success at local level.In multi-centric policymaking, advocacy is needed at different policy levels.The case of alcohol premises licensing illustrates how different policy centres have their own conventions and priorities.Public health actors described challenges in and bespoke strategies for engaging in their local licensing systems.\n",

In recent years, many local public health teams have become proactive in engaging with alcohol licensing, encouraging licensing authorities to act in ways intended to improve population health.\n \n \n \n This research aimed to explore and understand the approaches and activities of public health stakeholders (i.e. NHS staff and other public health professionals) in seeking to influence local alcohol licensing policy and decisions, and the views of licensing stakeholders (i.e. licensing officers/managers, police staff with a licensing remit, elected members and licensing lawyers/clerks) on the acceptability and effectiveness of these approaches.\n \n \n \n Local public health teams in England and Scotland were directly informed about this multisite study. Scoping calls were conducted with interested teams to explore their level of activity in alcohol licensing from 2012 across several categories. Twenty local authority areas with public health teams active in licensing matters were recruited purposively in England (n\u2009=\u200914) and Scotland (n\u2009=\u20096) to vary by region and rurality. Fifty-three in-depth telephone interviews (28 with public health stakeholders and 25 with licensing stakeholders outside health, such as local authority licensing teams/lawyers or police) were conducted. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically in NVivo 12 (QSR International, Warrington, UK) using inductive and deductive approaches.\n \n \n \n Public health stakeholders\u2019 approaches to engagement varied, falling into three main (and sometimes overlapping) types. (1) Many public health stakeholders in England and all public health stakeholders in Scotland took a \u2018challenging\u2019 approach to influencing licensing decisions and policies. Reducing health harms was felt to necessitate a focus on reducing availability and generating longer-term culture change, citing international evidence on the links between availability and alcohol-related harms. Some of these stakeholders viewed this as being a narrow, \u2018nanny state\u2019 approach, whereas others welcomed public health expertise and its evidence-based approach and input. (2) Some public health stakeholders favoured a more passive, \u2018supportive\u2019 approach, with some reporting that reducing availability was unachievable. They reported that, within the constraints of current licensing systems, alcohol availability may be contained (at least in theory) but cannot be reduced, because existing businesses cannot be closed on availability grounds. In this \u2018supportive\u2019 approach, public health stakeholders supplied licensing teams with data on request or waited for guidance from licensing teams on when and how to get involved. Therefore, public health action supported the licensing team in their aim of promoting \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018responsible\u2019 retailing of alcohol and/or focused on short-term outcomes other than health, such as crime. (3) Some public health stakeholders favoured a \u2018collaborative\u2019 approach in which they worked in close partnership with licensing teams; this could include a focus on containing availability or responsible retail of alcohol, or both.\n \n \n \n In engaging with alcohol licensing, public health stakeholders adapted their approaches, sometimes resulting in a diminished focus on public health goals. Sampling did not include lower-activity areas, in which experiences might differ. The extent to which current licensing systems enable achievement of public health goals is questionable and the effectiveness of public health efforts merits quantitative evaluation.\n \n \n \n The study is registered with the Research Registry as researchregistry6162.\n \n \n \n This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Public Health Research programme and will be published in Public Health Research.

    "title": "The intervention effect of local alcohol licensing policies on hospital admission and crime: a natural experiment using a novel Bayesian synthetictime-series method",
    "abstract": "Background Control of alcohol licensing at local government level is a key component of alcohol policy in England. There is, however, only weak evidence of any public health improvement. We used a novel natural experiment design to estimate the impact of new local alcohol licensing policies on hospital admissions and crime. Methods We used Home Office licensing data (2007\u20132012) to identify (1) interventions: local areas where both a cumulative impact zone and increased licensing enforcement were introduced in 2011; and (2) controls: local areas with neither. Outcomes were 2009\u20132015 alcohol-related hospital admissions, violent and sexual crimes, and antisocial behaviour. Bayesian structural time series were used to create postintervention synthetic time series (counterfactuals) based on weighted time series in control areas. Intervention effects were calculated from differences between measured and expected trends. Validation analyses were conducted using randomly selected controls. Results 5 intervention and 86 control areas were identified. Intervention was associated with an average reduction in alcohol-related hospital admissions of 6.3% (95% credible intervals (CI) \u221212.8% to 0.2%) and to lesser extent with a reduced in violent crimes, especially up to 2013 (\u20134.6%, 95%\u2009CI \u221210.7% to 1.4%). There was weak evidence of an effect on sexual crimes up 2013 (\u20138.4%, 95%\u2009CI \u221221.4% to 4.6%) and insufficient evidence of an effect on antisocial behaviour as a result of a change in reporting. Conclusion Moderate reductions in alcohol-related hospital admissions and violent and sexual crimes were associated with introduction of local alcohol licensing policies. This novel methodology holds promise for use in other natural experiments in public health.",

    "title": "Local Alcohol Policy Implementation in Scotland: Understanding the Role of Accountability within Licensing",
    "abstract": "Scotland has been ambitious in its policy and legislative efforts to tackle alcohol-related harm, efforts which include the innovative feature of a \u2018public health objective\u2019 within local alcohol licensing. However, the persistence of alcohol-related harms and inequalities requires further examination of both the overarching Scottish alcohol strategy and its specific implementation. A qualitative case study was undertaken to explore how alcohol policy is implemented locally in Scotland, with data generated from (i) documentary analysis of 12 relevant policies, legislation, and guidance documents; and (ii) a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 54 alcohol policy implementers in three Scottish localities and nine national-level stakeholders. The data suggest there is a tension between the intentions of licensing legislation and the way it is enacted in practice, and that accountability emerges as an important factor for understanding why this occurs. In particular, there are a lack of accountability mechanisms acting upon Scottish Licensing Boards to ensure they contribute to the public health goals of the Scottish alcohol strategy. From a public health perspective, this has perpetuated a system in which Licensing Boards continue to act with autonomy from the rest of the alcohol policy implementation system, creating a challenge to the achievement of public health goals. Alcohol policy in Scotland is likely to fall short of intended goals as long as the tension between licensing legislation and enacted licensing practices remains.",

    "title": "Lockdown and licensed premises: COVID\u201019 lessons for alcohol policy",
    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction The COVID\u201019 pandemic necessitated unprecedented changes in alcohol availability, including closures, curfews and restrictions. We draw on new data from three UK studies exploring these issues to identify implications for premises licensing and wider policy. Methods (i) Semi\u2010structured interviews (n =\u200917) with licensing stakeholders in Scotland and England reporting how COVID\u201019 has reshaped local licensing and alcohol\u2010related harms; (ii) semi\u2010structured interviews (n =\u200915) with ambulance clinicians reporting experiences with alcohol during the pandemic; and (iii) descriptive and time series analyses of alcohol\u2010related ambulance callouts in Scotland before and during the first UK lockdown (1 January 2019 to 30 June 2020). Results COVID\u201019 restrictions (closures, curfews) affected on\u2010trade premises only and licensing stakeholders highlighted the relaxation of some laws (e.g. on takeaway alcohol) and a rise in home drinking as having long\u2010term risks for public health. Ambulance clinicians described a welcome break from pre\u2010pandemic mass public intoxication and huge reductions in alcohol\u2010related callouts at night\u2010time. They also highlighted potential long\u2010term risks of increased home drinking. The national lockdown was associated with an absolute fall of 2.14 percentage points [95% confidence interval (CI) \u22123.54, \u22120.74; P =\u20090.003] in alcohol\u2010related callouts as a percentage of total callouts, followed by a daily increase of +0.03% (95% CI 0.010, 0.05; P =\u20090.004). Discussion and Conclusions COVID\u201019 gave rise to both restrictions on premises and relaxations of licensing, with initial reductions in alcohol\u2010related ambulance callouts, a rise in home drinking and diverse impacts on businesses. Policies which may protect on\u2010trade businesses, while reshaping the night\u2010time economy away from alcohol\u2010related harms, could offer a \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 for policymakers and health advocates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID\u201019 pandemic led to major changes in public policies to address supply chain disruption and escalated the price of consumer disinfectant products. To address market demands on alcohol\u2010based hand rubs and disinfectants, Health Canada implemented major changes to the regulations regarding composition, handling, transportation, and packaging to insure product availability. Furthermore, accelerated licensing of ingredients and packaging did not meet standard medical quality guidelines yet were authorized for manufacturing and packaging of alcohol\u2010based hand rubs and disinfectants. The accountability associated with these policy changes were reactive, including industry self\u2010reporting, consumer reporting, and Health Canada advisories and recalls that were responsive to products after they were available in the market. Nonetheless, Canadian public health policy increased hand sanitizers availability. However, some of the interim policies have raised major public health concerns associated with ethanol quality, packaging, and labeling, and enforcement of regulations. In this paper, we review the changes in the Canadian regulations amid the current pandemic and we evaluate the unintended health risks that might arise from these changes.",

    "title": "Testing the impact of local alcohol licencing policies on reported crime rates in England",
    "abstract": "Background Excessive alcohol use contributes to public nuisance, antisocial behaviour, and domestic, interpersonal and sexual violence. We test whether licencing policies aimed at restricting its spatial and/or temporal availability, including cumulative impact zones, are associated with reductions in alcohol-related crime. Methods Reported crimes at English lower tier local authority (LTLA) level were used to calculate the rates of reported crimes including alcohol-attributable rates of sexual offences and violence against a person, and public order offences. Financial fraud was included as a control crime not directly associated with alcohol abuse. Each area was classified as to its cumulative licensing policy intensity for 2009\u20132015 and categorised as \u2018passive\u2019, low, medium or high. Crime rates adjusted for area deprivation, outlet density, alcohol-related hospital admissions and population size at baseline were analysed using hierarchical (log-rate) growth modelling. Results 284 of 326 LTLAs could be linked and had complete data. From 2009 to 2013 alcohol-related violent and sexual crimes and public order offences rates declined faster in areas with more \u2018intense\u2019 policies (about 1.2, 0.10 and 1.7 per 1000 people compared with 0.6, 0.01 and 1.0 per 1000 people in \u2018passive\u2019 areas, respectively). Post-2013, the recorded rates increased again. No trends were observed for financial fraud. Conclusions Local areas in England with more intense alcohol licensing policies had a stronger decline in rates of violent crimes, sexual crimes and public order offences in the period up to 2013 of the order of 4\u20136% greater compared with areas where these policies were not in place, but not thereafter.",

    "title": "New Zealand\u2019s new alcohol laws: protocol for a mixed-methods evaluation",
    "abstract": "BackgroundAlcohol consumption is a major cause of mortality and morbidity globally. In response to strong calls from the public for alcohol law reform, the New Zealand Government recently reduced the blood alcohol limit for driving and introduced the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act which aim to (1) improve community input into local decision-making on alcohol; (2) reduce the availability of alcohol; and (3) reduce hazardous drinking and alcohol-related harm. In this project we seek to evaluate the new laws in terms of these objectives.Design and methodsA policy evaluation framework is proposed to investigate the implementation and outcomes of the reforms. We will use quantitative and qualitative methods, employing a pre-post design. Participants include members of the public, local government staff, iwi (M\u0101ori tribal groups that function collectively to support their members) and community group representatives. Data will be collected via postal surveys, interviews and analysis of local government documents. Liquor licensing, police and hospital injury data will also be used. Community input into local government decision-making will be operationalised as: the number of objections per license application and the number of local governments adopting a local alcohol policy (LAP). Outcome measures will be the \u2018restrictiveness\u2019 of LAPs compared to previous policies, the number (per 1000 residents) and density (per square kilometre) of alcohol outlets throughout NZ, and the number of weekend late-night (i.e., post 10\u00a0pm) trading hours. For consumption and harm, outcomes will be the prevalence of hazardous drinking, harm from own and others\u2019 drinking, community amenity effects, rates of assault, and rates of alcohol-involved traffic crashes. Multiple regression will be used to model how the outcomes vary by local government area from before to after the law changes take effect. These measures will be complemented by qualitative analysis of LAP development and public participation in local decision-making on alcohol.DiscussionThe project will evaluate how well the reforms meet their explicit public health objectives.",

    "title": "Factors influencing public health engagement in alcohol licensing in England and Scotland including legal and structural differences: comparative interview analysis.",
    "abstract": "Background\nGreater availability of alcohol is associated with higher consumption and harms. The legal systems, by which premises are licensed to sell alcohol in England and Scotland, differ in several ways. The 'Exploring the impact of alcohol licensing in England and Scotland' study measured public health team activity regarding alcohol licensing from 2012 to 2019 and identified seven differences between England and Scotland in the timing and type of activities undertaken.\n\n\nObjectives\nTo qualitatively describe the seven previously identified differences between Scotland and England in public health approaches to alcohol licensing, and to examine, from the perspective of public health professionals, what factors may explain these differences.\n\n\nMethods\nNinety-four interviews were conducted with 52 professionals from 14 English and 6 Scottish public health teams selected for diversity who had been actively engaging with alcohol licensing. Interviews focused primarily on the nature of their engagement (n = 66) and their rationale for the approaches taken (n = 28). Interview data were analysed thematically using NVivo. Findings were constructed by discussion across the research team, to describe and explain the differences in practice found.\n\n\nFindings\nDiverse legal, practical and other factors appeared to explain the seven differences. (1) Earlier engagement in licensing by Scottish public health teams in 2012-3 may have arisen from differences in the timing of legislative changes giving public health a statutory role and support from Alcohol Focus Scotland. (2) Public Health England provided significant support from 2014 in England, contributing to an increase in activity from that point. (3) Renewals of statements of licensing policy were required more frequently in Scotland and at the same time for all Licensing Boards, probably explaining greater focus on policy in Scotland. (4) Organisational structures in Scotland, with public health stakeholders spread across several organisations, likely explained greater involvement of senior leaders there. (5) Without a public health objective for licensing, English public health teams felt less confident about making objections to licence applications without other stakeholders such as the police, and instead commonly negotiated conditions on licences with applicants. In contrast, Scottish public health teams felt any direct contact with applicants was inappropriate due to conflicts of interest. (6) With the public health objective in Scotland, public health teams there were more active in making independent objections to licence applications. Further in Scotland, licensing committee meetings are held to consider all new applications regardless of whether objections have been submitted; unlike in England where there was a greater incentive to resolve objections, because then a meeting was not required. (7) Finally, Scottish public health teams involved the public more in licensing process, partly because of statutory licensing forums there.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe alcohol premises licensing systems in England and Scotland differ in important ways including and beyond the lack of a public health objective for licensing in England. These and other differences, including support of national and local bodies, have shaped opportunities for, and the nature of, public health engagement. Further research could examine the relative success of the approaches taken by public health teams and how temporary increases in availability are handled in the two licensing systems.\n\n\nFunding\nThis article presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Public Health Reseacrh programme as award number 15/129/11.",

    "title": "Impact of free health check-ups on elderly healthcare utilization and health: a pooled cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Health check-ups have emerged as a promising tool for disease prevention and health improvement. China introduced a community-based program providing annual health check-ups and consultation services at no cost for seniors aged 65 and above. However, the program's impact has not yet been evaluated. This study purposed to assess the impact of the free health check-up program for the elderly. We analysed a pooled cross-sectional data from the National Health Service Survey (Shandong) in 2013 and 2018, comprising 38,948 representative samples. The outpatient care utilization, inpatient care utilization, and the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ5D) score were used to assess the program's effects on reducing medical use and improving health. A combined Difference-in-Difference and treatment-effect model were employed to assess the program's impact, after balancing the differences between the 2013 and 2018 samples using Coarsened Exact Matching. Moreover, this study explored variations in impact between urban and rural areas, as well as potential mechanism of underlying policy effect. The free health check-up program for the elderly was significantly associated with an increase in EQ5D score and a reduction in outpatient care and inpatient care utilization (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Furthermore, the impacts were differed between urban and rural areas. The implementation of the free health check-up program has a statistically significant negative impact on the inpatient care utilization(P\u2009<\u20090.1) and positive impact on EQ5D scores (P\u2009<\u20090.05) among rural elderly, while these impacts do not reach statistical significance for urban elderly. The results of mechanism analysis indicated that free health check-ups program assists elderly in improving health through reducing unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. The free health check-up program for the elderly was associated with a reduction in their medical use and an increase in their health, positioning it as a potential model for other countries grappling with an ageing populace. Despite free nature of the program, the increment in the health check-up utilization remains low among the elderly. Enhanced efforts to promote effective use and follow-up consultation are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory approaches to alcohol availability vary widely, yet policies that control the number or location of alcohol retail outlets remain under-documented. This study aimed to identify and describe these approaches across jurisdictions in the USA and Canada. A two-stage document analysis was conducted for all 50 states, 10 Canadian provinces, and three Canadian territories (jurisdictions). Relevant legislative documents were identified and reviewed, with data extracted on policies establishing quantitative thresholds on either total outlet numbers (including outright prohibition), outlets numbers per population, distances between alcohol retail outlets, or distances between alcohol retail outlets and sensitive locations such as schools. Data collection took place between March and May 2024. Among 63 jurisdictions, 56 (88.9 %) used at least one approach to limiting the number and/or location of alcohol retail outlets, with 39 (61.9 %) using two or more. The most common approach (63.5 % of jurisdictions) was limiting minimum distances between outlets and specific locations, such as schools or places-of-worship. Population-based limits on outlet density were used by 44.4 % of jurisdictions, but thresholds varied substantially, (e.g. from 1.36 to 200 outlets per 100,000 population for on-sales, and 5.00 to 200 per 100,000 population for off-sales). Nearly half of all jurisdictions (47.6 %) had at least one dry county or area, while a smaller proportion (17.5 %) set minimum distances between outlets to prevent clustering. Fixed caps on the absolute number of outlets, regardless of population size, were least common (12.7 %). Quantitative controls on the number and/or location of alcohol retail outlets are widely used across the USA and Canada but vary significantly in structure and stringency. While some jurisdictions impose multiple controls, others apply none. Understanding these policy approaches provides insight into regulatory frameworks but does not indicate enforcement levels or public health impact. Further research could examine how these measures are implemented and whether different models influence alcohol availability.",

    "title": "Inertia or unanticipated bottlenecks? Exploring stakeholder perspectives on the implementation determinants of the national alcohol policy five years post-enactment in Zambia.",
    "abstract": "Alcohol use accounts for a huge proportion of the global burden of disease, and many countries grapple with its severe negative social and health consequences. In 2018, Zambia adopted a national alcohol policy with the aim to reduce the prevalence and impact of harmful alcohol use. However, five years post-adoption, the policy implementation has been slow. This study sought to explore the implementation determinants of the national alcohol policy five years post-enactment in Zambia. Implementation determinants, a concept from Bullocks theoretical framework, refer to the enabling and inhibiting factors that shape the alcohol policy and related implementation outcomes among implementing agents and teams. We employed a qualitative case study design using data collected from 25 semi-structured interviews targeting government ministries, civil society, and agencies responsible for enforcing the alcohol policy. We applied both inductive and deductive manifest thematic analysis using Bullock's analytical framework for understanding the determinants of implementing evidence-based policies. The alcohol policy was generally viewed by key stakeholders as comprehensive framework for action, yet its policy directives remained unclear. A restructured policy coordination committee enhanced the organisational capacity to implement joint action for this policy. However, weak collaboration between the council and state police hampered the enforcement of alcohol laws. Implementing agencies faced obstacles such as lack of financial and human resources, absence of rehabilitation services, and misapplication of alcohol selling licences. Further, community inaction and resistance to alcohol control laws affected the policy implementation. The socio-political environment contributed to implementation challenges through framing alcohol as an economic development issue and culturally tolerating harmful alcohol use. Additionally, changes in government affected policy ownership while unregulated illicit alcohol production and the sale of traditional and imported spirits further hampered the implementation of the policy. Overcoming implementation hurdles to the alcohol policy demands comprehensive strategies such as engaging communities, challenging cultural norms, strategically assigning funding, and fostering collaboration among implementing agencies. This may entail leveraging enablers such as stakeholder recognition of the policy framework and the restructured committee for the coordination of the alcohol policy implementation. Key actions should include empowering local government to enforce measures to reduce unregulated alcohol availability and ensure adequate resource allocation for alcohol control activities among implementation agents, including those providing treatment and rehabilitation services.",

    "title": "Health conditions that impact fitness-to-practice in physicians: a scoping review.",
    "abstract": "It has been over 50\u2009years since health conditions in physicians were first suggested to affect their fitness-to-practice, with consequent impacts on patient safety and patient care. Recent policy positions from physician regulatory bodies express a desire for clarity regarding the impact of these health conditions alongside their standardization in physician regulatory processes. Furthermore, these conditions have not been fully enumerated. Therefore, this scoping review intended to find all health conditions which were identified in the literature to impact physician fitness-to-practice. A specialist librarian developed and executed a systematic literature search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase via Ovid, APA PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global (to January 2024). The SPIDER framework was used for inclusion criteria and records were screened independently by two reviewers by title and abstract, and then by full text. Any study addressing a health condition identified as able to affect fitness-to-practice in physicians and surgeons, physician assistants, or medical trainees was eligible. In 403 eligible records of 2542 screened, 4336 total mentions of 203 fitness-to-practice-related health conditions were identified. Conditions relating to mental health issues (32.0%) and drug/substance use (26.0%) comprised more than half of the condition reports. This was followed by neurological conditions (13.2%), medical conditions (12.8%), alcohol use (6.0%), addiction (3.0%), and aging (2.9%) as well as conditions affecting dexterity/fine motor skills/psychomotor performance (2.1%), vision (1.4%), and hearing (0.6%). This scoping review identified a wide variety of health conditions which could affect physician fitness-to-practice, with a potential impact on patient care and safety. These conditions have persisted in the literature, and we commend them to the attention of practicing physicians, researchers, regulators, and physician health programs.",

    "title": "Are alcohol restrictions bad for tourism? An exploratory study of tourism trends in Western Australia.",
    "abstract": "Potential negative impacts of alcohol policy on tourism are a controversial issue, particularly for regional Australia. We aimed to understand tourism activity in the context of Section 64 area-wide alcohol restrictions implemented in Western Australia. Restrictions information allowing placement of conditions on liquor licences limiting alcohol sales in specified communities was collated (e.g. off-premises trading hours). Time-trends in visitor trips across tourism regions with/without restrictions were examined for changes. For domestic trips, regional trend-fitting and time-series cross-correlations were conducted for restricted versus non-restricted non-metropolitan regions. Subsequent to restrictions in North-West and Golden Outback regions, areas affected by restrictions increased over time. International trips contributed < 20 % of total trips. All domestic series were either stable or in decline up to 2009/10, and thereafter all experienced growth. Combined trip numbers for restricted versus non-restricted non-metropolitan regions were significantly cross-correlated (0.48, p=0.03). Restrictions aimed at reducing alcohol-related harms in regional WA do not appear to have negatively affected tourism. Evidence-informed policies that reduce community-wide alcohol availability are critical to addressing risks to public health and safety. Objection to restrictions on the basis of negative tourism effects may be misguided and counter-productive to sustainable tourism growth.",

    "abstract": "Public health discussions now apply the label of 'unhealthy commodities' to items attractive to consumers but which bring harm to health and welfare. The list includes tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and other drugs, sugar-sweetened beverages, overprocessed foods and commercial gambling. The histories of markets and controls in such commodities vary, with commerce in alcohol, drugs and gambling prohibited in many places at times during the last two centuries, but few limits on sugar, or on tobacco until recent years. In the current world, regimes vary for retail sale between commodities and in different jurisdictions. Some examples are given of successful control measures which might be more widely applied: measures such as licensing of retail sales; closing off web-based sales; and imposing minimum unit pricing. The new thinking in public health offers the opportunity to look across what have been separate fields of action and experience and to learn from case study examples of effective mechanisms to reduce rates of harmful consequences from unhealthy commodities.",

    "abstract": "Limiting the availability of alcohol is one of the most effective approaches for reducing alcohol misuse and its health consequences. However, few studies have examined the changing trajectories of alcohol environment characterized jointly by on- and off-premises outlets and their sociodemographic disparities. We aimed to (1) explore 25-year profiles of changes in the alcohol environment in urban areas in the U.S.; and 2) examine sociodemographic disparities in these changes. We used parallel-process latent class growth analyses to identify profiles of changes in the alcohol environment, based on the availability of both on-premises and off-premises outlets. We employed conditional multinomial models to examine associations between profiles of change in the alcohol environment and sociodemographic characteristics at census tract level. We identified 6 distinct profiles that outlined variations in availability of on- and off-premises alcohol outlets and change trajectories, and found variability in these trajectories across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Tracts with a higher percentage of Blacks and other minoritized populations had higher odds of being in alcohol environment classes featuring high/medium density of alcohol outlets and increasing trends of on-premises outlets. Additionally, tracts with lower income and lower percentage of residents with college degree had higher odds of having medium and high density of alcohol outlets and increasing in on-premises outlets over time. Differences by area level income and education were greater for Blacks and other minority racial/ethnic groups. Since alcohol outlets often require licensing to open, our results suggest that policy-level interventions are needed to reduce racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities.",

Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. 40 primary care clinics in Japan that did not provide routine screening and brief intervention for hazardous drinking or treatment or self-help groups for alcohol dependency. 1133 outpatients aged 20-74 years with hazardous drinking (AUDIT-C (alcohol use disorders identification test-consumption) scores \u22655 for men and \u22654 for women). Clinic clusters were allocated to a study arm using a computer generated random sequence. Participants and staff who collected participant reported outcomes remained blinded to assignment. Primary care clinics were randomised to ultra-brief intervention (21 clinics, 531 patients) or simplified assessment only (19 clinics, 602 patients) groups. The intervention group comprised screening with AUDIT-C followed by brief oral advice and an alcohol information leaflet delivered in <1 minute. The control group comprised simplified assessment with AUDIT-C only. The primary outcome was total alcohol consumption in the four weeks preceding the 24 week follow-up. Secondary outcomes included total alcohol consumption in the four weeks preceding the 12 week follow-up, and readiness to change drinking behaviour, measured at 12 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, the difference in total alcohol consumption between the ultra-brief intervention group (1046.9 g/4 weeks (g/4wk), 95% confidence interval (CI) 918.3 to 1175.4) and control group (1019.0 g/4wk, 893.5 to 1144.6) was 27.8 g/4wk (-149.7 to 205.4, P=0.75), with a Hedges' g of 0.02 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.14). At 12 weeks, the difference in total alcohol consumption between the intervention group (1034.1 g/4wk, 919.6 to 1148.7) and control group (979.3 g/4wk, 866.1 to 1092.4) was 54.9 g/4wk (-104.1 to 213.9, P=0.49), with a Hedges' g of 0.04 (-0.08 to 0.16).

    "abstract": "Background Unhealthy alcohol consumption is a severe public health problem. But low to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with high subjective well-being, possibly because alcohol is commonly consumed socially together with friends, who often are important for subjective well-being. Disentangling the health and social complexities of alcohol behavior has been difficult using traditional rating scales with cross-section designs. We aim to better understand these complexities by examining individuals\u2019 everyday affective subjective well-being language, in addition to rating scales, and via both between- and within-person designs across multiple weeks. Method We used daily language and ecological momentary assessment on 908 US restaurant workers (12692 days) over two-week intervals. Participants were asked up to three times a day to \u201cdescribe your current feelings\u201d, rate their emotions, and report their alcohol behavior in the past 24 hours, including if they were drinking alone or with others. Results Both between and within individuals, language-based subjective well-being predicted alcohol behavior more accurately than corresponding rating scales. Individuals self-reported being happier on days when drinking more, with language characteristic of these days predominantly describing socializing with friends. Between individuals (over several weeks), subjective well-being correlated much more negatively with drinking alone (r = -.29) than it did with total drinking (r = -.10). Aligned with this, people who drank more alone generally described their feelings as sad, stressed and anxious and drinking alone days related to nervous and annoyed language as well as a lower reported subjective well-being. Conclusions Individuals\u2019 daily subjective well-being, as measured via language, in part, explained the social aspects of alcohol drinking. Further, being alone explained this relationship, such that drinking alone was associated with lower subjective well-being.",

    "title": "Shortening time for access to alcohol drives up front-loading behavior, bringing consumption in male rats to the level of females",
    "abstract": "Background Incentives to promote drinking (\u201chappy hour\u201d) can encourage faster rates of alcohol consumption, especially in women. Sex differences in drinking dynamics may underlie differential health vulnerabilities relating to alcohol in women versus men. Herein, we used operant procedures to model the happy hour effect and gain insight into the alcohol drinking dynamics of male and female rats. Methods Adult male and female Wistar rats underwent operant training to promote voluntary drinking of 10% (w/v) alcohol (8 rats/sex). We tested how drinking patterns changed after manipulating the effort required for alcohol (fixed ratio, FR), as well as the length of time in which rats had access to alcohol (self-administration session length). Rats were tested twice within the 12\u00a0h of the dark cycle, first at 2\u00a0h (early phase of the dark cycle, \u201cearly sessions\u201d) and then again at 10\u00a0h into the dark cycle (late phase of the dark cycle, \u201clate sessions\u201d) with an 8-h break between the two sessions in the home cage. Results Adult females consumed significantly more alcohol (g/kg) than males in the 30-min sessions with the FR1 schedule of reinforcement when tested late in the dark cycle. Front-loading of alcohol was the primary factor driving higher consumption in females. Changing the schedule of reinforcement from FR1 to FR3 reduced total consumption. Notably, this manipulation had minimal effect on front-loading behavior in females, whereas front-loading behavior was significantly reduced in males when more effort was required to access alcohol. Compressing drinking access to 15\u00a0min to model a happy hour drove up front-loading behavior, generating alcohol drinking patterns in males that were similar to patterns in females (faster drinking and higher intake). Conclusions This strategy could be useful for exploring sex differences in the neural mechanisms underlying alcohol drinking and related health vulnerabilities. Our findings also highlight the importance of the time of testing for detecting sex differences in drinking behavior. Voluntary alcohol drinking is higher in adult female rats compared to adult male rats. This sex difference is most pronounced in the later phase of the dark cycle, and when the operant effort is minimal (when 1 lever press gives 1 reward: fixed ratio 1, FR1). Higher alcohol intake in females is primarily due to \u201cfront-loading\u201d, or the rapid consumption of alcohol within the first 5\u00a0min of access. Increasing the effort required to obtain alcohol from FR1 to FR3 dampens front-loading drinking behavior, resulting in similar levels of total intake in males and females. Compressing the time of access to 15\u00a0min drives up front-loading to such a degree that rats end up consuming more alcohol in total than they do in 30-min sessions. In males, this increase in drinking is large enough that it eliminates the sex difference in total alcohol intake.",

    "title": "A big night out getting bigger: Alcohol consumption, arrests and crowd numbers, before and after legislative change",
    "abstract": "Background Restrictive practices on alcohol sales in entertainment districts have been introduced to reduce alcohol-related violence in youth. On 1st July 2016, the Queensland State Government (Australia) imposed a 2-hour reduction in trading hours for alcohol sales in venues within specific night-time entertainment districts (NEDS; from 5am to 3am), a reduction in maximum trading hours for venues outside NEDs (with a maximum 2am closing time), the banning of \u2018rapid intoxication drinks\u2019 (e.g. shots) after 12am, and no new approvals for trading hours beyond 10pm for the sale of takeaway alcohol. No independent study has evaluated general levels of intoxication, crowd numbers, fear of violence, and illicit substance use as people enter and exit NEDS, both before and after the introduction of restrictive legislation. Further, no study has assessed the impact using matched times of the year in a controlled study and also assessed actual assault rates as recorded by the police. Method We conducted 3 studies\u2013randomly breath-testing patrons for alcohol, as they entered and exited NEDs. Study 1 assessed patrons\u2019 (n = 807) breath approximated blood alcohol concentration (BrAC) and predictions of how the legislation would change their drinking habits before the legislation was enacted. Study 2 assessed crime statistics and patrons\u2019 BrAC levels and drug taking reports on an equivalent night, one year apart\u2013before (n = 497) and after (n = 406) the new legislation. Study 3 was a test of the generalisation of Study 2 with two months of survey and BrAC data collected as people entered and exited the NEDs over two consecutive years before (n = 652 and n = 155) and one year after (n = 460) the new legislation. In Study 3 we also collected crime statistics and data on people leaving the entertainment district one year before (n = 502) and one year after (n = 514) the legislative change. Findings People predicted that the legislation would lead to them drinking more alcohol before they entered town or make little change to their drinking habits. Baseline data over the 2 years before the legislation (Study 3) demonstrated stable preloading rates and BrAC at entry to the NEDs. However, after the introduction of the legislation patrons entered the NEDs systematically later and increased their alcohol preloading. People were substantially more inebriated as they entered the NEDs after the legislative change, with approximately 50% fewer people not preloading after the new laws. Exit BrAC was less consistent but showed some evidence of an increase. Crime statistics and patrons\u2019 self-reported experiences of violence did not change. Interpretation Legislation that does not specifically adapt to the cultural shift of preloading and take local conditions into account will be unsuccessful in reducing alcohol consumption. Such legislation is unlikely to meaningfully change assault rates in youth.",

    "title": "The behavioral economics of the bottomless cup: The effects of alcohol cup price on consumption in college students.",
    "abstract": "Heavy drinking among college students is a public health concern in part due to the accessibility of alcohol and promotions such as \"happy hours,\" which discount the price of alcohol. In addition, consuming alcohol at unregulated off-campus parties may result in greater alcohol consumption, higher blood alcohol concentrations, and increased negative consequences. The purpose of the current study was to assess demand for a refillable red \"Solo\" cup using a new hypothetical purchase task, the Cup-Price Purchase Task (CPPT). The CPPT asked college student participants to read a description of an off-campus party drinking context and indicate the likelihood of purchasing a refillable cup at prices ranging from $0.00-$60.00. We found that at cup prices of $5.00 or below, the likelihood of purchase was 75% or higher; however, probability of purchase decreased to about 47% at a cup price of $10.00. In addition, several CPPT behavioral economic parameters were positively correlated with the Alcohol Purchase Task (APT) and other alcohol-related measures, providing support for the CPPT's construct validity. Finally, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that maximum expenditure on the CPPT was a unique predictor of both alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences, even after controlling for the APT metrics. These findings may inform future studies investigating the behavioral economics of high-risk drinking situations and potential strategies to reduce binge drinking.

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol consumption among youth and young adults is a major public health concern. On March 1, 2010 the German federal state of Baden-W rttemberg banned the sale of alcoholic beverages between 10pm and 5am in off-premise outlets (e.g. kiosks, petrol stations, supermarkets). We use rich monthly administrative data from a 70 percent random sample of all hospitalizations for the years 2007-2010 in Germany in order to evaluate the impact of this policy on alcohol-related hospitalizations. Applying a difference-in-difference approach, we find that the policy change reduces alcohol-related hospitalizations among adolescents and young adults by about 9 percent. The empirical results suggest that limiting late hours during which alcoholic beverages are allowed to be sold is an effective and rather \"costless\" public health initiative for reducing high-risk drinking among youth and young adults.",

This study sought to estimate the availability of sachet alcohol among retail food and beverage establishments in two Ugandan districts (Kampala and Jinja) before and after enactment of the national sachet alcohol ban.\n\n\nMETHOD\nIndependent observations in 100 establishments were conducted by a pair of trained observers during the peak hours of 7 P.M. to 1 A.M. Using a standardized checklist, observers recorded indications of alcohol availability before and after enactment of the sachet alcohol ban.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAvailability of (a) alcohol and (b) sachet alcohol were significantly affected by the ban. Before the ban, 69% of all establishments sold alcohol; there was a significant reduction in alcohol availability after enactment of the ban to 43% of the establishments (p < .001). This reduction was observed in off-premise establishments (p < .001), but not in on-premise establishments (p = .710). Additionally, before the sachet alcohol ban, 52% of all establishments sold sachet alcohol; however, there was a significant reduction in sachet availability after enactment of the ban (1.4%, p < .001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLegislation banning the manufacture and sale of sachet alcohol has the potential to reduce sachet availability. Future studies should examine changes in alcohol consumption following the sachet alcohol ban.",

    "title": "A Social Media-Based Acute Alcohol Consumption Behavior (NekNomination): Case Series in Italian Emergency Departments",
    "abstract": "Background NekNomination, also known as NekNominate, Neck and Nominate, or Neck Nomination, is a social network\u2013based drinking game which is thought to have originated in Australia and spread all over the world between 2013 and 2014. Individuals record videos of themselves while rapidly drinking excessive quantities of alcoholic drinks (necking) and then nominate friends to outdo them within 24 hours; the videos are then posted on social media such as Facebook or YouTube. The consequences of this drinking game have been very dangerous; at least 5 people under age 30 years have died after drinking deadly cocktails, and many others have suffered from alcohol intoxication. Objective The goal of the research is to evaluate data about clinically important acute alcohol intoxication among teenagers and young adults and inform and educate the general public, especially parents, teachers, and health workers, about the spreading craze of dangerous Internet-related behavior among today\u2019s teenagers and young people up to the age of 23 years. Methods Patients aged 15 to 23 years with acute alcohol intoxication who came to the emergency department (ED) of 2 major hospitals in Italy from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2014, were included in this study. Data were retrieved from prehospital and intrahospital medical records and included personal information, methods of intoxication, triage color code, date and time of access to the ED, any relevant signs and symptoms, blood alcohol concentration, and diagnosis at discharge. Results A total of 450 young patients (male 277/450, 61.5%, female 173/450, 38.5%; age 15 to 16 years 15/450, 3.3%, age 17 to 18 years 184/450, 40.9%, age 19 to 23 years 251/450, 55.8%) were recruited. The causes of intoxication were happy hour, binge drinking, NekNominate, eyeballing, other alcoholic games, or a mix of them. Happy hour was found to be more common among the older patients, whereas NekNominate accounted for almost half of the youngest group of hospitalizations. Eyeballing occurred in 1.6% (7/450) of cases; binge drinking and other alcoholic games caused 23.3% (105/450) and 23.8% (107/450) of hospitalizations, respectively. On admission, 44.2% (199/450) of patients were assigned a red or yellow color code requiring immediate medical attention; about 14% of them required additional medical assistance (after being in the ED) or hospitalization, some in semi-intensive care units. Conclusions Our study shows that the increased numbers of hospitalizations due to alcohol intoxication in the adolescent age group, as a consequence of NekNominate or other drinking games, is alarming and represents a serious public health issue. The potential markers of improper use of social networks must be clearly identified, including categories at risk of alcohol abuse, in order to develop intervention and prevention strategies in terms of education and awareness, which may help in averting potentially fatal episodes.",

    "title": "Comment on \u201cbinge drinking and alcohol prices\u201d",
    "abstract": "To the editors of health economics review: There is ample evidence on the effects of prices and taxes on heavy drinking, including binge drinking [1]. Experiments on \u201cHappy Hour\u201d discounts in barroom settings have shown that when the price of alcohol decreases, consumption increases, and vice versa [2, 3]. A well-cited meta-analysis of 112 studies (Wagenaar et al., [4]) identified ten studies on heavy drinking and estimated a significant elasticity of \u22120.28. Another systematic review by Elder and colleagues [5] concluded that alcohol tax levels were inversely associated with excessive drinking. This is consistent with the conclusion from a widely-cited review by Cook and Moore [6] that \u201can increase in price results in reduced consumption\u201d, and this applies to drinking by youth, heavy drinkers, and alcoholics who develop cirrhosis due to chronic consumption. Xuan and colleagues [7] showed that an improved comprehensive measure of alcohol taxes including specific excise tax and value-based taxes resulted in more negative tax elasticity and price elasticity predicting binge drinking, as compared to a conventional measure that relies only on beer excise tax. Another meta-analysis by Wagenaar and colleagues [8] showed that increased taxes and prices were associated with reduced alcohol-related disease and injury outcomes that are attributable to binge drinking. Nevertheless, in an issue of Health Economics Review, Dr. Jon Nelson published a \u201csystematic\u201d review article with the following conclusion: \u201cIncreased alcohol taxes or prices are unlikely to be effective as a means to reduce binge drinking, regardless of gender or age group.\u201d [9]. We have reviewed this paper based on its methodology, study interpretation, and conclusion.",

    "title": "British Muslim women's experience of the networking practice of happy hours",
    "abstract": "Networking is deemed important for women in careers. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the interaction of a specific networking practice with a religious practice and its implications on British Muslim women (BMw). The practice \u2018happy hours\u2019 is closely linked with drinking alcohol (Flores-Pereira et al., 2008), while alcohol consumption is forbidden in Islam.,A qualitative research approach was used to interview 37 participants who were in managerial or professional positions.,The findings demonstrate that the presence of alcohol in work-related socializing is a norm, making the practice of \u2018happy hours\u2019 invisible and legitimate (Acker, 2006), thereby contributing inadvertently to reinforcing inequality regimes in organizations. Furthermore, the interaction of contradictory religious beliefs/practices of individual employees and organizational practices presents challenges for Muslim women, who feel they have to participate in happy hours as a networking practice in order to progress in careers. While it involves emotional effort, as they persuade themselves to join in activities where alcohol is being served, it paradoxically results in feelings of exclusion and marginalization within the group, as they do not drink alcohol.,This paper focuses on the micro/individual level of analysis, singling out the Muslim female voice while positioning \u2018happy hours\u2019 as a \u2018networking practice\u2019. It also contributes to the underexplored area of the role of religion and individual behaviour in organizations (Tracey, 2012).",

    "title": "Community-Level Alcohol Availability and Child Maltreatment: A Statewide Panel Analysis Over 13 Years.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nParental or caregiver alcohol use, particularly heavy regular or episodic use, can increase the risk of child maltreatment within individual families. At the national level, higher per capita alcohol consumption has been associated with increased child injury mortality in Australia. This study aimed to investigate whether an association exists between substantiated child maltreatment cases, numbers of licensed outlets, and average alcohol sales volumes at the community level (local government area [LGA]) over a 13-year period across Western Australia (WA).\n\n\nMETHOD\nAnnual panel data were obtained for 132 WA LGAs over the period 2001-2013. Bayesian conditional autoregressive Poisson regression was applied to test associations between numbers of substantiated child maltreatment cases and per-population densities and mean sales volumes of off-trade and on-trade alcohol outlets. Associations were adjusted for the presence of local alcohol restrictions and mandatory reporting; density of on-trade outlets; and their sales, demographic, and socioeconomic variables.\n\n\nRESULTS\nComprehensive area-level alcohol bans and policies restricting alcohol sales reduced child maltreatment by 9.6% and 38.5%, whereas mandatory reporting of child maltreatment increased substantiations by 15.3%. Counterintuitively, for each additional 1,000 L of ethanol sold per off-premise outlet, there was a 3.7% decline in child maltreatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLocal government alcohol restrictions predicted reduced child abuse and neglect. Findings that increases in off-trade outlets predicted a decreased risk of child maltreatment at a local level are seemingly at odds with these findings, but outlet density may be acting as a measure of less disorganization. Alcohol policy that affects alcohol availability can reduce child maltreatment in at-risk areas. Local area alcohol bans and interventions reducing hours of sale should be further evaluated to confirm these findings.",

    "title": "Selling World Health Organization's Alcohol \u201cBest Buys\u201d and Other Recommended Interventions in an Urban Chinese Population: Public Acceptability of Alcohol Harms Reduction Strategies in Hong Kong",
    "abstract": "Background To counter the harms caused by alcohol use, the World Health Organization (WHO) outlined a series of evidence-based recommendations, including the highly cost-effective \u201cBest Buys\u201d recommendations. While many Western countries have been actively introducing alcohol harms reduction strategies, it is unclear whether these cost-effective policies would be publicly acceptable in Asian regions with traditionally low alcohol consumption. This study examines the public acceptability of WHO-recommended alcohol harms reduction strategies in an Asian city with few extant alcohol regulations. Methods A cross-sectional telephone survey of Hong Kong Chinese residents aged 18\u201374 (n = 4,000) was conducted from January to August 2018. Respondents were asked about their perceptions of various WHO-recommended strategies and consequences of their implementation. After reducing the strategies into several policy categories by principal component analysis, multivariable linear regression was performed to identify factors associated with endorsement of the various policies. Results Among the \u201cBest Buys\u201d, introduction of moderate beer/wine taxes (68.7%) and shortened alcohol retail hours (51.9%) were the most supported while bans on event sponsorships (19.5%) and public drinking events (17.7%) were the least popular. Strategies targeting young drinkers were particularly highly supported. Males, younger adults, Non-abstainers, and those who believed in drinking's social benefits were less likely to endorse stringent control measures (p < 0.05). Adults with higher household income were less supportive, partially due to concerns about infringements on local economy, lifestyles, and economic freedom. Women and older people were generally more supportive, partially because they perceived these policies would lower alcohol-related harms. Conclusion In order to reduce barriers to implementing WHO-recommended strategies in the region, it is imperative to increase awareness of alcohol-related harms and to strengthen beliefs in the effectiveness of these countermeasures, especially among men, young adults, and drinkers.",

    "title": "Acceptability, feasibility and fidelity of the culturally adapted version of Unplugged (\u201cYo Se Lo Que Quiero\u201d), a substance use preventive program among adolescents in Chile: a pilot randomized controlled study",
    "abstract": "The consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis is a public health problem that impacts the cognitive, social, and emotional development of adolescents. Prevention strategies such as the \u201cUnplugged\u201d program are effective in delaying the progression of daily smoking and episodes of drunkenness among adolescents. \u201cYo Se Lo Que Quiero\u201d (YSLQQ) corresponds to the adaptation of this program to the Chilean context. This study assesses the acceptability and feasibility of implementing this program to the local reality. This was a cluster-randomized controlled pilot study conducted on six public schools. All consented students attending 6th, 7th, and 8th grades (n\u2009=\u20091,180) participated in the study. The schools were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in a 1:1 ratio: (1) the \u201cYSLQQ\u201d intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009526), and (2) the Control group (n\u2009=\u2009654). The program consisted of a 12-hour class-based curriculum based on a comprehensive social-influence approach delivered by a trained facilitator. The acceptability and feasibility were assessed in the intervention group at the end of the intervention using questionnaires answered by students and facilitators. The quality and fidelity of the program were evaluated during the implementation using self-ported surveys answered by the facilitators and the assessment of video-recorded sessions rated by external observers. Finally, a pre-test and a post-test survey assessing past and current substance use and risk and protective factors were conducted before and immediately after the program\u2019s implementation. A high proportion of students (49.6%) liked the sessions. 79.2% reported that the YSLQQ helped them learn about the dangers of substances, while 65.8% reported having more skills to avoid substance use in the future. Regarding students\u2019 satisfaction with YSLQQ, 62.9% reported being happy or very happy with the program. Facilitators reported implementing the intervention according to the manual in 73.9% of sessions. Regarding substance use, students who participated in the intervention groups reported a significant reduction in drunkenness in the last year and last 30-day prevalence and also a significant reduction in a lifetime and 30-day prevalence of cannabis use when compared with those students in the control group. Our results suggest that YSLQQ has adequate acceptability and feasibility to be implemented in the Chilean context, and there were promising results in reducing drunkenness and cannabis use. Future research should confirm these results in a larger RCT study. The trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04566627; registration date: 01/03/2019",

    "title": "A national assessment of on-premise drinking establishments near public universities: Drink prices, drink specials, indoor tobacco use, and state-level alcohol laws.",
    "abstract": "Inexpensive drinks and price promotions increase alcohol consumption and have been observed at on-premise drinking establishments near large colleges. Some bars may sell tobacco products and allow indoor tobacco use to encourage patrons to stay and drink more. This study examined drink prices/specials and associated practices of on-premise drinking establishments including tobacco sales and policies regarding tobacco use. In 2018, telephone calls about prices/practices were made to 403 randomly selected bars/nightclubs within 2\u2009miles of large residential universities in each U.S. state. The Alcohol Policy Information System provided data on state-level alcohol laws. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models examined associations between alcohol prices/specials, state laws, and establishment practices. The average price for the least expensive draft beer and a vodka shot at each location were $3.62 (SD\u00a0=\u00a0$1.15) and $4.77 (SD\u00a0=\u00a0$1.16), respectively. Most establishments (65%) had happy hour specials, 6% had 2-for-1 specials, 91% sold food, 9% sold cigarettes, 8% allowed smoking indoors, and 18% permitted electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use indoors. Allowing e-cigarette use indoors (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.54) and selling cigarettes (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.79) were associated with lower vodka prices; allowing cigarette smoking indoors (b\u00a0=\u00a0-0.46) was associated with lower beer prices. Lower beer prices (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.38), selling food (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.97), and no state law banning happy hour specials altogether (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.24) or with full-day price reduction exemptions (OR\u00a0=\u00a012.74) were associated with higher odds of having happy hour specials. Allowing e-cigarette use indoors was associated with having 2-for-1 specials (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.38). In bars near large public universities, beers and shots were often available for less than $5 and drink specials were prevalent. Further, some establishments allowed tobacco use indoors and/or sold cigarettes. Laws that increase alcohol taxes, set minimum drink prices, and ban the sale and indoor use of tobacco products at on-premise drinking locations are important harm reduction tools.",
