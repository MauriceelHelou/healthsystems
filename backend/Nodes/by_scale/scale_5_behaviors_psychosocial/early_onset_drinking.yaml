description: |-
  Percentage of youth who first consumed alcohol (more than a few sips) before age 15.
  Early onset drinking is one of the strongest predictors of later alcohol use disorder -
  those who start drinking before 15 are 4x more likely to develop AUD compared to those
  who wait until 21. Early initiation interferes with brain development during adolescence,
  increases risk-taking behavior, and establishes drinking patterns before mature decision-
  making capacity develops. Prevention efforts targeting delayed initiation can substantially
  reduce population-level AUD prevalence.
