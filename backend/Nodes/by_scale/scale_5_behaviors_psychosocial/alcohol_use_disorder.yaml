description: 'Prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) as defined by DSM-5 criteria, measured as

  percentage of adults meeting diagnostic criteria in the past 12 months. AUD is a

  clinical diagnosis with 11 symptom criteria; mild (2-3), moderate (4-5), or severe

  (6+) classification. This is a standalone diagnostic measure independent of causes

  or consequences. Relationships to risk factors (e.g., genetics, ACEs, policies) and

  outcomes (e.g., liver disease, mortality) are captured in mechanisms. Approximately

  10-12% of US adults meet criteria for past-year AUD.'
