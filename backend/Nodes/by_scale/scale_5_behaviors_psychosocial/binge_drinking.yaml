description: |-
  Percentage of adults (18+) who engaged in binge drinking in the past 30 days.
  Binge drinking is defined as consuming 5 or more drinks (men) or 4 or more drinks
  (women) on a single occasion. This is a standalone behavioral measure with a
  standardized definition; approximately 90% of alcohol consumed by youth and 50%
  consumed by adults occurs through binge drinking. Relationships to health outcomes,
  risk factors, or downstream conditions are captured in mechanisms, not in this
  node definition. This node measures the behavior itself, independent of causes
  or consequences.
