description: |-
  Measures the restrictiveness of state and local policies governing alcohol retail outlet licensing,
  zoning restrictions, and density limits. Higher scores indicate more restrictive policies that limit
  the number and concentration of alcohol outlets. Includes licensing quota systems, distance requirements
  from schools/churches, population-based caps, and local option laws. Research shows outlet density
  is associated with increased alcohol consumption, violence, and alcohol-related harms.
