description: 'Clinical measure of craving intensity among individuals with alcohol use disorder,

  assessed using validated instruments such as the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS)

  or Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). Craving is a core feature of AUD

  recognized in DSM-5 and a primary treatment target. This is a standalone intermediate

  pathway measure; relationships to treatment outcomes or relapse are captured in

  mechanisms. Craving is targeted by pharmacotherapy (e.g., naltrexone).'
