description: 'Percentage of individuals with AUD who received an FDA-approved medication for alcohol

  use disorder: naltrexone (oral or extended-release injectable), acamprosate, or

  disulfiram. Despite strong evidence for efficacy, MAT for AUD is dramatically

  underutilized - less than 2% of those with AUD receive any medication. This is far

  lower than MAT rates for opioid use disorder. Barriers include lack of prescriber

  knowledge, patient preference for abstinence-only approaches, limited integration

  with behavioral treatment, and insurance coverage gaps.'
