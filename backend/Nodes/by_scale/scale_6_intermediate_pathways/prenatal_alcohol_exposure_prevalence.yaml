description: |-
  Prevalence of alcohol exposure during pregnancy, measured as percentage of pregnancies
  with any reported maternal alcohol consumption. This is a standalone intermediate
  pathway measure capturing a biological exposure state. Despite public health messaging,
  approximately 10% of pregnant women report any alcohol use and 3-5% report binge drinking.
  Relationships to downstream outcomes (e.g., FASD) are captured in mechanisms.
  No known safe amount of alcohol exposure during pregnancy exists.
