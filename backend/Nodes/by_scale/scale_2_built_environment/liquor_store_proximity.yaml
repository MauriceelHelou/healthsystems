description: |-
  Average distance from residential addresses to the nearest off-premise alcohol outlet (liquor
  store, convenience store selling alcohol, grocery store with alcohol sales). Lower values
  indicate greater physical accessibility to purchase alcohol. Proximity is associated with
  increased consumption and alcohol-related problems, particularly for heavy drinkers. Youth
  drinking initiation is earlier in areas with closer alcohol access. This measure captures
  the friction cost of obtaining alcohol in the physical environment.
