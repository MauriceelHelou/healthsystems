description: |-
  Percentage of individuals whose immediate social network (close friends, regular
  companions) includes predominantly heavy drinkers. Social network drinking norms
  strongly influence individual consumption through modeling, social pressure, and
  normalization. Network effects are bidirectional - heavy drinkers cluster together,
  but changing network composition can support recovery. Social network interventions
  are increasingly recognized as important for both prevention and treatment. This
  captures the peer influence environment at the individual/household level.
