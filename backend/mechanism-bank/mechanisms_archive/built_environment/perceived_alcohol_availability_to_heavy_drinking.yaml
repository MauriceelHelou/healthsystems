direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High density of alcohol outlets and extended trading hours creates spatial
  environment where alcohol is easily accessible'
- 'Step 2: Perceived easy availability reduces barriers to obtaining alcohol, including
  time and transportation costs'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access barriers enable more frequent purchasing occasions and opportunistic
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Increased purchasing frequency and accessibility facilitates transition
  from occasional to regular heavy drinking patterns'
