- 'Step 1: Parks and green spaces provide accessible, low-cost venues for physical activity (walking, jogging, sports, recreation)'
- 'Step 2: Natural environments are more appealing for exercise than built environments, increasing motivation'
- 'Step 3: Green spaces facilitate social physical activity (group sports, walking with others) that reinforces habits'
- 'Step 4: Proximity reduces transportation and time barriers to accessing exercise opportunities'
- 'Step 5: Regular green space utilization increases moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels'

description: Green space access is associated with increased physical activity levels. Parks provide accessible venues for walking, exercise, and recreation. A recent study using wearable device data found that a 10% increase in park accessibility was associated with 107 additional daily steps. Public parks are estimated to contribute 15-20% of total population physical activity. The relationship operates through reduced barriers (cost, transportation, time), enhanced motivation in natural settings, and social facilitation of exercise.

  equity_implications: Physical activity disparities by income and race reflect unequal access to safe, quality parks rather than individual motivation. Low-income communities have fewer parks, smaller parks, and parks with fewer amenities. Structural interventions include equitable park investment, maintenance in underserved areas, and safe routes to parks.
assumptions:
- Assumes physical activity occurs in parks (not just passive use)
- Assumes proximity enables access
- Assumes parks are safe and usable
limitations:
- Cross-sectional studies cannot establish causation
- Self-selection of active people into neighborhoods with parks
- Park quality and amenities not always measured
- General greenness (NDVI) less consistently associated than park access
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Park distribution and quality vary by neighborhood income and racial composition
  relevant_geographies:
  - Urban areas with limited private yard space show stronger park effects
  - Low-income neighborhoods have fewer and lower-quality parks
  - Suburban areas may rely more on private facilities
