direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High density of alcohol outlets in neighborhood increases physical availability
  and accessibility of alcohol for residents'
- 'Step 2: Greater access reduces barriers to alcohol purchase and normalizes alcohol
  consumption through environmental cues and commercial promotion'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure to alcohol-related marketing and social drinking contexts
  in the neighborhood facilitates more frequent and higher-volume alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Men with HIV in alcohol-dense neighborhoods engage in hazardous drinking
  patterns due to structural factors of availability and environmental influences'
