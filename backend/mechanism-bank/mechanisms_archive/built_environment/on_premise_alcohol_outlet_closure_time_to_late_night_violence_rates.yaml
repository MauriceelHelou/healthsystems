  node_id: late_night_violence_rates

direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Later closure times for bars and hotels create extended periods when large
  numbers of intoxicated patrons congregate in entertainment districts'
- 'Step 2: Spatial concentration of intoxicated individuals in areas with multiple
  licensed venues increases density of potential violence incidents'
- 'Step 3: Late-night hours combined with alcohol intoxication create environmental
  conditions where interpersonal conflicts more readily escalate to violence'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged operation into early morning hours (after 2-3:30am) maintains
  high-risk environments during peak violence times'
