category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol outlet density in adjacent neighborhoods could influence local
  areas through spillover effects'
- 'Step 2: Residents may travel to nearby areas with higher outlet concentrations
  for alcohol purchases or consumption'
- 'Step 3: Neighborhood boundaries are permeable, so nearby outlet density could affect
  local drinking patterns and social dynamics'
- 'Step 4: However, spatially lagged alcohol outlet variables were not relevant in
  predicting child maltreatment risk in Valencia'
