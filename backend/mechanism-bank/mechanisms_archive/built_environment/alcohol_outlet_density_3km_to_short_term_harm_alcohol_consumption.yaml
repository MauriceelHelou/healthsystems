direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets within 3 km increases physical availability
  and accessibility of alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Increased proximity to outlets reduces barriers to alcohol purchase (time,
  transportation costs)'
- 'Step 3: Greater convenience and marketing exposure from multiple outlets normalizes
  higher frequency purchasing'
- 'Step 4: Increased purchasing opportunities lead to more frequent consumption exceeding
  short-term harm thresholds (>4 drinks on any day)'
