to_node:
  node_id: stroke_incidence
  node_name: Stroke Incidence
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term NO2 exposure creates chronic environmental burden on the cerebrovascular
  system'
- 'Step 2: NO2 induces endothelial dysfunction and promotes pro-thrombotic states
  through oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation and altered hemostasis increase risk of both ischemic
  and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular events'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated vascular damage manifests as clinical stroke events'

    differences in stroke vulnerability and NO2 effects may exist, though specific

    relationships with stroke incidence
