- 'Step 1: Structural racism shapes geographic distribution of food retail, creating
  food deserts in African American communities'
- 'Step 2: Limited availability of nutritious, affordable food options constrains
  dietary choices'

  nutrient-poor foods'
- 'Step 4: Dietary patterns characterized by poor nutritional quality contribute to
  excess calorie intake and obesity development'
