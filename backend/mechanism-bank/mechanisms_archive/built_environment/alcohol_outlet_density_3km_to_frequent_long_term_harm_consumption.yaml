  Harm Guidelines

  node_name: Frequent Alcohol Consumption Above Long-Term Harm Guidelines
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher outlet density within 3 km creates routine exposure to alcohol retail
  environments'
- 'Step 2: Frequent exposure to outlets and marketing normalizes regular alcohol consumption
  patterns'
- 'Step 3: Convenience of multiple nearby outlets reduces effort needed for regular
  purchasing'
- 'Step 4: Pattern of frequent purchasing becomes established, leading to regular
  consumption above long-term harm guidelines (>2 drinks at least weekly)'
