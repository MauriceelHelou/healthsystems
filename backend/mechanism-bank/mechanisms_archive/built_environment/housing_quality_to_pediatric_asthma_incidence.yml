mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing quality creates structural defects (inadequate ventilation, water intrusion, pest
  entry points)'
- 'Step 2: Structural defects enable environmental exposures (dampness, mold growth, allergen accumulation)'
- 'Step 3: Indoor air quality deteriorates with increased particulates and biological contaminants'
- 'Step 4: Repeated exposure to poor indoor air quality triggers respiratory inflammation and sensitization'
- 'Step 5: Chronic respiratory inflammation leads to asthma development in susceptible children'

description: Poor housing quality creates environmental conditions that directly compromise indoor air
  quality, leading to respiratory sensitization and asthma development in children through repeated exposure
  to biological and physical contaminants.

  variation_notes: Effects were most pronounced in older buildings (built pre-1978) and in humid climates
moderators:

  description: Older buildings (pre-1978) have deteriorated infrastructure and outdated building standards
    that worsen housing quality impacts
- name: climate_humidity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Humid climates exacerbate moisture-related housing problems like mold growth and dampness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how housing policy failures (weak building codes, inadequate
    maintenance standards, insufficient affordable housing investment) directly produce pediatric health
    inequities. Low-income families are structurally constrained to poor-quality housing due to market
    failures and policy neglect, not personal choices.
