  interpretation: Each 1 degree C temperature rise increases kidney morbidity by 1%
    and kidney mortality by 3%. Occupational heat exposure in agriculture creates
    epidemic-level CKD in some regions.

description: Ambient temperature and heat exposure are associated with increased
  kidney disease morbidity and mortality. A meta-analysis found 1% increase in kidney
  morbidity and 3% increase in kidney mortality per 1 degree C temperature rise.
  Chronic occupational heat exposure in agriculture and construction has created epidemic
  chronic kidney disease of unknown cause (CKDu) in Central America and South Asia,
  affecting up to 20% of workers in some communities. Climate change will amplify
  these effects globally.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: climate_occupation
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Heat-related kidney disease reflects occupational and climate
    justice inequities. Agricultural workers and outdoor laborers, often low-income
    and immigrant populations, face the greatest exposure. Climate change amplifies
    these occupational hazards. Solutions require workplace heat protections, occupational
    safety enforcement, and climate adaptation in agricultural communities rather
    than expecting individual workers to avoid heat exposure.
assumptions:
- Heat exposure includes both ambient temperature and occupational heat
- Kidney disease includes acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease
- CKDu in agricultural communities is heat-related (debated but substantial evidence)
limitations:
- CKDu etiology still debated (agrochemicals, heat, other factors)
- Individual-level exposure measurement limited in most studies
- Confounding by hydration behavior and other factors
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Heat-related kidney disease varies by climate, agricultural practices,
    and occupational safety standards.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Central American Pacific coast (sugarcane agriculture)
  - South Asian agricultural regions
  - US agricultural communities (California, Florida)
