category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Automatic alcohol detection system continuously monitors driver''s blood
  alcohol content through sensors before vehicle ignition'
- 'Step 2: Raspberry Pi processor analyzes alcohol sensor data and prevents engine
  activation when alcohol levels exceed safe thresholds'
- 'Step 3: Physical prevention of vehicle operation eliminates opportunity for drunk
  driving incidents'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in drunk driving incidents directly decreases traffic fatalities
  attributed to alcohol impairment'
