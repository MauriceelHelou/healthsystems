mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing insecurity creates barriers to consistent medical care and medication access'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing leads to frequent relocations disrupting continuity of care'
- 'Step 3: Poor housing conditions expose individuals to severe asthma triggers'
- 'Step 4: Combination of inadequate medical management and severe environmental exposures increases risk
  of fatal asthma attacks'

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how housing policy intersects with healthcare access
    to create life-threatening disparities. It demonstrates how structural inequities in both housing
    and healthcare systems compound to create differential mortality risks by socioeconomic status.
