direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Existing detection technologies face multiple structural limitations: semiconductor
  sensors have instability and short lifespan, infrared analyzers have structural
  constraints, in-vehicle air detection is susceptible to external influences'
- 'Step 2: These technologies require periodic calibration, skilled operators (chromatography),
  or are sensitive to environmental factors (temperature, humidity)'
- 'Step 3: Technical unreliability and maintenance requirements reduce system deployment
  and consistent operation'
- 'Step 4: Limited deployment and operational inconsistency reduces population-level
  effectiveness of drunk driving prevention'
