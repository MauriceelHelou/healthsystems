  node_name: HIV Transmission Among People Who Inject Drugs
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unstable housing creates lack of secure storage for sterile injection equipment
  and disrupts access to harm reduction services'
- 'Step 2: Housing instability increases survival behaviors requiring shared or rushed
  injection in unsafe environments'
- 'Step 3: Lack of private space forces congregate injection settings with higher
  likelihood of equipment sharing'
- 'Step 4: Increased equipment sharing and unsafe injection practices elevate HIV
  transmission risk'

  description: The effect is substantially stronger in high-income countries (tPAF
    17.2%) compared to low-income and middle-income countries (tPAF 6.6%), likely
    due to higher prevalence of unstable housing among PWID in high-income settings

  strength: strong
  description: Country-level tPAFs were strongly associated with the prevalence of
    unstable housing, indicating dose-response relationship
