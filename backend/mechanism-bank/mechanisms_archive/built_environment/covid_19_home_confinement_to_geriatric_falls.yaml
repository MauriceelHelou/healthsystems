mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic policies confine older adults to home environments for
  extended periods'
- 'Step 2: Increased time at home exposes older adults to home hazards (stairs, slippery
  surfaces, poor lighting, clutter) for longer durations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced outdoor activity and social engagement may decrease physical conditioning
  and balance'
- 'Step 4: Extended home confinement increases fall risk and incidence of fall-related
  injuries requiring emergency care'
