mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Occupational exposures to toxins, chemicals, or pollutants affect parental germline cells'
- 'Step 2: Environmental toxins create DNA damage and epigenetic modifications in reproductive cells'
- 'Step 3: Damaged or modified genetic material is transmitted to offspring at conception'
- 'Step 4: Altered genetic programming affects fetal respiratory system development'
- 'Step 5: Compromised respiratory health manifests in offspring'

description: Parental exposure to occupational hazards before conception damages germline cells through
  toxic exposures, leading to compromised respiratory health in their offspring through intergenerational
  transmission of environmental damage.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism demonstrates how labor policy failures (weak occupational safety
    standards, limited worker protections) create intergenerational health inequities. Workers don''t
    choose dangerous exposures - they result from power imbalances and inadequate regulation. Equity implication:
    Working-class communities and communities of color face disproportionate occupational hazards due
    to residential and occupational segregation, creating compounded intergenerational health burdens.'
