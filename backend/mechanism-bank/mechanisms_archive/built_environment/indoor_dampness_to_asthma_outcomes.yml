mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dampness in indoor home environments creates conditions for mold growth and dust mite proliferation'
- 'Step 2: Damp conditions release airborne allergens and irritants into the indoor air'
- 'Step 3: Exposure to these allergens triggers inflammatory responses in the respiratory system'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure leads to increased asthma symptoms and worse asthma control'

description: Indoor dampness was the exposure most consistently associated with adverse asthma outcomes
  across 79% of reviewed studies, representing the strongest environmental risk factor identified.
moderators:
- name: childhood_age
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: 66% of studies were conducted in children, suggesting stronger effects in pediatric populations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Dampness reflects structural housing quality issues often concentrated in low-income
    housing where residents lack resources for repairs or ability to relocate. This creates differential
    exposure based on socioeconomic position.
