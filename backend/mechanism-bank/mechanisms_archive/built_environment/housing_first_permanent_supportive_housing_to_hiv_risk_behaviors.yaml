mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permanent supportive housing provides stable residential environment for
  formerly homeless adults, reducing structural vulnerabilities associated with street
  homelessness'
- 'Step 2: Housing stability enables access to residential support services and case
  management that can address health risk behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Social network motivational interviewing intervention helps residents identify
  and visualize network members who influence HIV risk behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Visual feedback and guided discussion prompt residents to consider restructuring
  networks away from HIV risk-promoting relationships'
- 'Step 5: Network change reduces exposure to contexts and relationships that facilitate
  HIV transmission risk (e.g., drug-using networks, transactional sex contexts)'
