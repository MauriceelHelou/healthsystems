mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PM2.5 exposure causes non-fatal cardiovascular and respiratory diseases
  including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke
  with residual disability'
- 'Step 2: These conditions result in chronic functional limitations, reduced quality
  of life, and ongoing disability'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated disability across affected populations translates to years
  lived with disability (YLDs) at the population level'
