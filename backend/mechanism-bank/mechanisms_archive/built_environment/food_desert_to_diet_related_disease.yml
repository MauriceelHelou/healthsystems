mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhood disinvestment and market forces result in supermarket closures and limited healthy food retail'
- 'Step 2: Residents rely on convenience stores, fast food, and small grocery stores with limited fresh produce'
- 'Step 3: Higher prices and lower quality of healthy foods in available outlets reduce healthy food consumption'
- 'Step 4: Dietary patterns shift toward processed, calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods'
- 'Step 5: Long-term dietary patterns increase risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease'

description: Food deserts - areas with limited access to affordable healthy food - contribute to diet-related health disparities through structural barriers to healthy eating. Systematic reviews document that low-income and minority neighborhoods have fewer supermarkets, more fast food outlets, and higher prices for healthy foods. However, research also shows that food access alone is insufficient; relative prices and demand factors also shape dietary behaviors.

  equity_implications: Food deserts result from market decisions about where to locate stores, reflecting historical redlining and ongoing neighborhood disinvestment. Low-income and minority neighborhoods are systematically underserved. Policy solutions should address both access (new stores, farmers markets) and affordability (SNAP incentives, subsidies) rather than blaming individual food choices.
assumptions:
- Food desert defined by USDA criteria (low access, low income)
- Diet-related disease includes obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease
- Mechanism operates through retail food environment
limitations:
- Supermarket placement alone may not change dietary behavior
- Demand-side factors (preferences, food culture) also shape diet
- Food desert definitions vary across studies
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Food desert prevalence varies by urban/rural status and neighborhood demographics
  relevant_geographies:
  - Urban food deserts in low-income minority neighborhoods
  - Rural food deserts with long distances to any grocery store
  - Tribal areas with limited food retail infrastructure
