  node_id: alcohol_related_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Mortality
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density increases population-level alcohol consumption
  through greater physical availability'
- 'Step 2: Increased excessive alcohol consumption leads to higher rates of chronic
  conditions including liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers'
- 'Step 3: Excessive consumption also increases risk of acute harms including overdose,
  accidents, and injuries'
- 'Step 4: Combined chronic and acute alcohol-related health effects result in increased
  mortality at the population level'
