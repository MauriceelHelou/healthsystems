- 'Step 1: Poor quality housing exposes residents to indoor air pollutants and respiratory irritants'
- 'Step 2: Limited transportation options restrict access to specialized respiratory healthcare services'
- 'Step 3: Housing instability forces residence in areas with higher environmental exposures'
- 'Step 4: Transportation barriers delay emergency care for respiratory exacerbations'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism directly addresses structural determinants through housing policy
    and transportation infrastructure. It recognizes how built environment policies create differential
    exposures and access barriers, focusing on systemic solutions rather than individual housing choices.
    Housing stability emerges as a key structural factor affecting respiratory health outcomes.
