direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol outlet concentration reflects and reinforces neighborhood disadvantage,
  often clustering in areas with pre-existing social and economic marginalization'
- 'Step 2: High outlet density creates environmental context marked by disorder, reduced
  neighborhood cohesion, and elevated exposure to violence and crime'
- 'Step 3: Persons living with HIV already experience elevated mental health burden
  from HIV-related stigma, discrimination, and healthcare challenges'
- 'Step 4: Neighborhood alcohol environment adds additional chronic stressor that
  compounds existing vulnerabilities, increasing overall mental health co-morbidity
  burden in this population'
