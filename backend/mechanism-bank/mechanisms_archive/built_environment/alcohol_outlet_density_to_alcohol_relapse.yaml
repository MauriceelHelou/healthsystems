  node_name: Alcohol Relapse/Rising Dependence
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High density of bars and alcohol outlets increases physical availability
  and visibility of alcohol in the neighborhood environment'
- 'Step 2: Greater outlet density exposes individuals in recovery to more alcohol-related
  cues and triggers in daily routines'
- 'Step 3: Increased physical proximity reduces barriers to alcohol access during
  vulnerable moments or craving episodes'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to alcohol-saturated environments undermines recovery
  maintenance and increases relapse probability'
