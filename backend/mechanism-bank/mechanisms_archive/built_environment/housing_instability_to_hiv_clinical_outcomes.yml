mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates barriers to consistent healthcare access and medication storage'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing environments increase stress and reduce ability to maintain treatment routines'
- 'Step 3: Frequent moves and temporary accommodations disrupt continuity of care with healthcare providers'
- 'Step 4: Poor clinical outcomes result from inconsistent treatment adherence and care disruptions'

description: Housing instability among people living with HIV is associated with poorer clinical outcomes,
  with effects observed even among those who are not homeless
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 4050
moderators:
- name: homelessness_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effects are independent of homelessness status, indicating housing instability has impacts
    beyond just homelessness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces housing instability to health outcomes through structural
    barriers in healthcare systems and built environment factors that affect care continuity. Addresses
    systemic issues rather than individual behaviors.
