mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher concentration of on-premise alcohol outlets (bars, restaurants serving
  alcohol) increases alcohol consumption and intoxication in public spaces'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol consumption impairs judgment and increases aggressive
  behavior among patrons'
- 'Step 3: Congregation of intoxicated individuals in concentrated areas creates opportunities
  for interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Conflicts escalate to violent confrontations resulting in increased violent
  crime incidents'

    density was not significantly associated with violent crime, suggesting other
    structural factors may be more dominant in these areas
