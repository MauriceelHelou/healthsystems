- 'Step 1: Autonomous vehicle technology removes or minimizes human driver role in
  vehicle operation'
- 'Step 2: Reduced dependence on human decision-making and motor skills eliminates
  primary pathway through which alcohol impairment causes crashes'
- 'Step 3: Vehicle systems maintain safe operation regardless of operator impairment
  status'
- 'Step 4: Elimination of impaired human control over vehicles prevents alcohol-related
  crash occurrences'
