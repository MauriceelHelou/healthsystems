direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High industrial presence, toxin release, and density of pre-1978 structures
  create environmental contamination exposure including lead and industrial chemicals'
- 'Step 2: Environmental toxins affect neurological development through direct biological
  pathways including neurotoxic effects on prefrontal cortex and regulatory systems'
- 'Step 3: Neurotoxic exposure impairs executive function, impulse control, and emotional
  regulation capabilities in developing children'
- 'Step 4: Children with impaired neurological regulatory capacity exhibit oppositional
  defiance problems as a manifestation of reduced behavioral control'
