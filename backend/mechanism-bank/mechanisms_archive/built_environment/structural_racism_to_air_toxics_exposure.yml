- 'Step 1: Historical redlining and discriminatory zoning concentrated communities
  of color in industrial areas'
- 'Step 2: Polluting industries systematically located in marginalized communities
  due to weaker political power and land costs'
- 'Step 3: State-level structural racism perpetuates patterns through continued discriminatory
  policy and enforcement'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative air toxics exposure (criteria pollutants, hazardous air pollutants)
  elevated in high-racism states'
- 'Step 5: Elevated exposure translates to increased cancer and respiratory health
  risks concentrated in communities of color'

  interpretation: Structural racism at state level is significantly associated with
    elevated air toxics exposure and cancer/respiratory health risks, with communities
    of color bearing disproportionate burden

description: Structural racism, as measured by state-level racism indices capturing
  residential segregation, incarceration disparities, and political participation
  gaps, is significantly associated with elevated air toxics exposure and resulting
  cancer and respiratory health risks. The association persists after controlling
  for individual demographics, indicating a structural rather than compositional effect.
  Cancer risk is 2.71x higher in high-racism vs. low-racism states; respiratory risk
  is 2.98x higher.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: systemic_racism
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural racism operates
    through multiple channels (residential segregation, political disenfranchisement,
    discriminatory zoning) to create environmental health inequities. Solutions require
    addressing root causes including residential integration, environmental justice
    enforcement, and community power-building rather than expecting communities to
    move or adapt to toxic environments.
assumptions:
- State racism index captures meaningful structural variation
- Air toxics exposure from EPA National Air Toxics Assessment
- Cancer and respiratory risk estimates from EPA risk models
limitations:
- Cross-sectional analysis limits causal inference
- State-level analysis may mask within-state variation
- Air toxics assessment has measurement limitations
- Some confounders may be on causal pathway (SES, urbanicity)
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Air toxics exposure and structural racism vary substantially by
    state and region, with highest disparities in Southern states and industrial areas.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Alabama shows highest cancer risk (48.40 per million)
  - North Dakota shows lowest (17.87 per million)
  - California shows highest respiratory risk (1.89 hazard quotient)
