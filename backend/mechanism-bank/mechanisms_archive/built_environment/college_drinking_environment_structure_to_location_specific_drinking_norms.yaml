- 'Step 1: College campuses and surrounding communities provide distinct physical
  drinking locations (dorms/homes, bars, party venues)'
- 'Step 2: Each location has different structural features (supervision levels, commercial
  interests, social density, regulatory oversight)'
- 'Step 3: These structural features create distinct social and normative environments
  within each location'
- 'Step 4: Different locations generate unique descriptive and injunctive norms about
  alcohol use'
