mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-impaired drivers have reduced reaction time, impaired judgment,
  and decreased motor control'
- 'Step 2: Impaired driving increases collision risk for all road users, including
  child passengers and youth pedestrians/cyclists'
- 'Step 3: Motor vehicle collisions cause traumatic injuries and fatalities disproportionately
  affecting vulnerable youth populations'
- 'Step 4: MVCs represent the highest number of unintentional injury-related deaths
  for children and teenagers in North Carolina'
