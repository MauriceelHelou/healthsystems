- 'Step 1: Broadband infrastructure enables access to telehealth services and online health information'
- 'Step 2: Patients can research provider quality and choose higher-quality healthcare facilities'
- 'Step 3: Remote monitoring and virtual consultations reduce need for in-person visits'
- 'Step 4: Improved care coordination through electronic health records and patient portals'
- 'Step 5: Earlier intervention and better disease management reduce hospitalizations and complications'

  interpretation: "Broadband rollout associated with 7% reduction in joint replacement readmission rates; approximately 12% of 1999-2008 improvement in joint replacement outcomes attributable to broadband expansion"

    notes: "Counties with highest internet access had less than 50% of the COVID-19 mortality compared to counties with lowest access (July-October 2020)"
  - metric: Diabetes prevalence difference per quintile
    value: 9.6
    type: percentage_change
    notes: "Counties in any quintile of broadband access have on average 9.6% lower diabetes prevalence than those in the next lower quintile"

description: Broadband internet access significantly improves healthcare utilization and outcomes through multiple pathways including telehealth access, health information seeking, provider selection, and care coordination. The FCC has designated broadband as a "super determinant of health" due to its foundational role in enabling other health-related activities.

  equity_implications: Approximately 30% of rural residents lack broadband access, creating digital health deserts. Infrastructure investment disproportionately benefits urban areas, perpetuating rural-urban health disparities. Low-income households face affordability barriers even when infrastructure exists. Policy interventions should prioritize underserved areas and include affordability programs.
assumptions:
- Broadband defined as minimum speeds enabling video telehealth (typically 25 Mbps download)
- Healthcare utilization includes both preventive and acute care services
- Assumes baseline healthcare provider availability
limitations:
- Infrastructure investment has long lead times
- Connectivity alone insufficient without digital literacy support
- Some healthcare services require in-person delivery
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Impact strongest in rural and underserved areas with limited healthcare infrastructure
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural counties with no prior broadband show largest outcome improvements
  - Tribal lands face both infrastructure and regulatory barriers
  - Low-income urban areas may have infrastructure but face affordability gaps
