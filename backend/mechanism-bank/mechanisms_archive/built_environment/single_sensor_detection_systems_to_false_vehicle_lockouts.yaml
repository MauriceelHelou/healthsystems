direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Single-sensor detection systems have limited data inputs and lower accuracy
  in distinguishing driver alcohol exposure from ambient conditions'
- 'Step 2: Low detection accuracy leads to both false positives (locking vehicles
  when drivers are sober) and false negatives (failing to detect intoxicated drivers)'
- 'Step 3: Erroneous judgments reduce system reliability and user trust in drunk driving
  detection technology'
- 'Step 4: Inconsistent performance creates barriers to widespread adoption of automated
  drunk driving prevention systems'
