direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates environmental conditions that increase exposure
  to dangerous drug use contexts (e.g., lack of safe, private spaces for consumption)'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing reduces access to consistent healthcare and preventive
  services, limiting overdose prevention interventions'
- 'Step 3: Lack of stable housing increases stress and survival-focused behaviors
  that may lead to higher-risk drug use patterns'
- 'Step 4: These compounded vulnerabilities result in increased health crises requiring
  emergency hospital care'
