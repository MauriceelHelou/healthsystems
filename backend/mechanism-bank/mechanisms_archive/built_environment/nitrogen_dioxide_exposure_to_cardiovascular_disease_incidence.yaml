direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term NO2 exposure from traffic-related air pollution and industrial
  emissions creates sustained environmental exposure'
- 'Step 2: NO2 triggers systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in cardiovascular
  tissues'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation and oxidative damage lead to endothelial dysfunction
  and atherosclerotic processes'
- 'Step 4: Progressive vascular damage and atherosclerosis manifest as clinical cardiovascular
  disease events'

  description: Urban areas with higher traffic density and industrial activity likely
    have higher NO2 concentrations, potentially strengthening the association with
    cardiovascular disease

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Older adults (mean age 52.0 years) may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular
    effects of air pollution due to pre-existing subclinical disease and reduced physiological
    resilience
