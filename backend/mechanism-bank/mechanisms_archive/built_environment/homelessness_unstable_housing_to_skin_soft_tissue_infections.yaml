category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness and unstable housing result in lack of consistent access to
  private bathroom facilities and running water'
- 'Step 2: Without reliable access to hygiene infrastructure, individuals cannot maintain
  regular hand-washing routines before drug injection'
- 'Step 3: Unhygienic injection practices in the absence of proper hand-washing introduce
  pathogens at injection sites'
- 'Step 4: Pathogen introduction leads to development of injection-related abscesses
  and other soft tissue infections'
