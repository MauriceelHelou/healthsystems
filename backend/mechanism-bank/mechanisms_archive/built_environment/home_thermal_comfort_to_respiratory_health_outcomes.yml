description: Improved home thermal environment directly reduces respiratory health risks through decreased
  exposure to dampness-related health hazards.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how environmental health interventions address structural
    determinants of respiratory disease. Poor housing conditions disproportionately affect low-income
    renters who lack power to demand improvements from landlords. The intervention addresses market failures
    in rental housing quality.
