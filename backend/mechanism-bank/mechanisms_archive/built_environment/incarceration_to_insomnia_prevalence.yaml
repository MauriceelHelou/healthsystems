direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prison environments expose individuals to structural risk factors for insomnia
  including noise, lack of privacy, overcrowding, and institutional schedules'
- 'Step 2: Environmental stressors and lack of control over sleep conditions disrupt
  circadian rhythms and sleep architecture'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to adverse sleep conditions in carceral settings leads
  to development and maintenance of insomnia'
- 'Step 4: Elevated prevalence rates of insomnia emerge in prison populations (26.2%-72.5%)
  compared to general population'
