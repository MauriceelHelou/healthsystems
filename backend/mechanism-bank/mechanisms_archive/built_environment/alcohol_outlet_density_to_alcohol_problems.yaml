direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets in neighborhoods increases physical availability
  and accessibility of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Greater alcohol availability facilitates expression of genetic predisposition
  to alcohol problems through increased exposure and opportunity for consumption'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced gene-environment interaction leads to manifestation of alcohol
  use disorder symptoms and alcohol-related problems'
- 'Step 4: Environmental context modulates heritability estimates, with high-outlet-density
  neighborhoods showing 78% heritability versus 11% in zero-outlet neighborhoods'

  description: 'Genetic predisposition to alcohol problems strongly moderates the
    relationship between outlet density and alcohol problems. In high-outlet-density
    neighborhoods (>10 on-premises outlets), heritability was 78% (95% CI: 52-100%),
    compared to 11% (95% CI: 0-29%) in zero-outlet neighborhoods, indicating that
    environmental availability facilitates genetic expression.'
- name: on_premises_outlet_density
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Specifically on-premises outlets (bars, restaurants serving alcohol)
    showed the moderating effect. Neighborhoods with more than 10 on-premises outlets
    showed dramatically higher heritability of alcohol problems compared to neighborhoods
    with no on-premises outlets.
