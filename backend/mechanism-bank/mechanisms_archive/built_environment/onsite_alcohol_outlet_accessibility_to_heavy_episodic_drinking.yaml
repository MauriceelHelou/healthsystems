category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medium accessibility to onsite alcohol outlets (e.g., bars, restaurants)
  in British Columbia neighborhoods reflects regulated placement and licensing of
  drinking establishments'
- 'Step 2: Provincial alcohol control policies create spatial arrangements that moderate
  the concentration and distribution of venues where alcohol is consumed on premises'
- 'Step 3: Regulated spatial distribution reduces the convenience and ease of accessing
  venues that promote heavy episodic drinking occasions'
- 'Step 4: Structural controls on the drinking environment limit opportunities for
  binge drinking behaviors among young adults in those neighborhoods'

    outlet density regulations create varying levels of structural constraint on alcohol
    availability. British Columbia's policies appear to create protective effects
    not observed in Quebec.
