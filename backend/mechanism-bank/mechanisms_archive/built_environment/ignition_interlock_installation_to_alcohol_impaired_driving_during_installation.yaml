mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ignition interlock device physically prevents vehicle from starting if
  driver''s breath alcohol concentration exceeds threshold'
- 'Step 2: Device installed in driver''s vehicle creates technological barrier to
  impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: Driver unable to operate vehicle while impaired due to mechanical prevention'
- 'Step 4: Drinking and driving incidents reduced during period of device installation'
