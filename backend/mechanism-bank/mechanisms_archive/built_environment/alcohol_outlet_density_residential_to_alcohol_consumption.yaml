direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High density of alcohol outlets in residential neighborhoods increases
  physical availability of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Greater proximity and availability reduces barriers to alcohol purchase'
- 'Step 3: Increased accessibility facilitates more frequent alcohol purchasing and
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of problematic alcohol consumption occur in areas with dense
  outlet concentrations'
