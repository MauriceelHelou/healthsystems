direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability disrupts continuity of care by creating frequent changes
  in location and loss of connection to healthcare providers'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing reduces ability to store medications, attend appointments,
  and maintain treatment regimens for mental health and substance use issues'
- 'Step 3: Housing instability increases exposure to structural barriers including
  lack of transportation, inability to receive mail/appointment reminders, and competing
  survival needs that take priority over healthcare'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated barriers result in inability to access needed mental health
  and substance use services, creating unmet healthcare needs'

  description: Participants meeting criteria for drug dependence had additional elevated
    odds of unmet needs (aOR=1.22), suggesting drug dependence compounds the effect
    of housing instability on unmet healthcare needs
