category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing conditions create environmental triggers including mold, dust, pests, and poor
  ventilation'
- 'Step 2: Children with asthma experience repeated exposure to respiratory irritants in their home environment'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to allergens and irritants causes persistent airway inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Inflamed airways become hyperresponsive to additional triggers'
- 'Step 5: Increased frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations'

description: Substandard housing conditions expose children to environmental triggers that cause respiratory
  inflammation and increased asthma exacerbations.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects demonstrated in hyper-local South Side Chicago neighborhoods, suggesting geographic
    concentration of substandard housing
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural failures in housing code enforcement, landlord
    accountability, and housing quality standards. Poor housing conditions are concentrated in disinvested
    neighborhoods, typically communities of color, due to historical redlining and ongoing discriminatory
    practices. Housing quality is a policy choice, not individual responsibility.
