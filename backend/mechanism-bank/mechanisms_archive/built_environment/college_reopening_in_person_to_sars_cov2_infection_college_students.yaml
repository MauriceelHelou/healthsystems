direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: In-person instruction requires students to gather in enclosed classroom
  spaces with varying ventilation quality and capacity for physical distancing'
- 'Step 2: Campus reopening concentrates large numbers of young adults in residential
  settings (dormitories, off-campus housing) with shared facilities and social spaces'
- 'Step 3: Return to campus increases density of social networks and mixing patterns,
  facilitating viral transmission'
- 'Step 4: Campus environments that support high-risk behaviors (drinking venues,
  social gatherings) amplify transmission when students are physically present'
