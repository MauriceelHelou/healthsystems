direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Automobile traffic represents the primary environmental exposure risk for
  children and young people in developed nations'
- 'Step 2: High vehicle density and traffic volume increase frequency of child-vehicle
  interactions'
- 'Step 3: Children''s developmental stage creates vulnerabilities in spatial awareness,
  impulse control, and physical fragility'
- 'Step 4: Traffic accidents result in trauma that is a significant factor in infant
  and child mortality even in highly developed nations'
