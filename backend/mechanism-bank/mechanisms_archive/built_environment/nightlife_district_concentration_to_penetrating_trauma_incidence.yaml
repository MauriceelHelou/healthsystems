direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban planning concentrates bars, clubs, and alcohol venues in specific
  districts (Old Town, City Center, Oberbilk)'
- 'Step 2: Spatial concentration creates high-density crowds of intoxicated individuals
  in limited geographic areas'
- 'Step 3: Crowding and alcohol intoxication increase interpersonal conflicts and
  reduce natural surveillance'
- 'Step 4: Limited emergency response resources face higher demand in concentrated
  areas, particularly during weekend peak hours (20:00-04:00)'
