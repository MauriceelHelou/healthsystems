direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol availability increases physical accessibility to alcohol
  outlets in communities'
- 'Step 2: Increased outlet density and accessibility creates more opportunities and
  environmental cues for alcohol purchase and consumption'
- 'Step 3: Greater consumption increases exposure to alcohol''s toxic effects on multiple
  organ systems'
- 'Step 4: Sustained elevated consumption leads to chronic diseases, injuries, and
  other alcohol-related health harms at population level'

  description: Public health stakeholders taking challenging approach cited international
    evidence on links between availability and alcohol-related harms, suggesting robust
    evidence base supporting this mechanism.
- name: focus_on_short_term_outcomes
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Some public health stakeholders focused on short-term outcomes other
    than health (such as crime) rather than longer-term health harms, potentially
    reducing focus on health outcomes of availability.
