- 'Step 1: Climate change increases frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves'
- 'Step 2: Extreme heat stresses cardiovascular system through thermoregulatory demands
  (peripheral vasodilation, increased heart rate)'
- 'Step 3: Heat exposure triggers dehydration, blood viscosity changes, and electrolyte
  imbalances'
- 'Step 4: Pre-existing cardiovascular conditions (hypertension, heart failure, coronary
  disease) are exacerbated'
- 'Step 5: Cardiovascular events (stroke, heart attack, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest)
  increase during heat waves'

  interpretation: Heat waves increase cardiovascular mortality by 11.7% (RR 1.117),
    with high-intensity heat waves increasing risk by 18.9% (RR 1.189). Each 1 degree
    C increase raises cardiovascular mortality by 2.1%.

description: Climate change-driven heat waves significantly increase cardiovascular
  mortality. A meta-analysis of 266 studies from 20 countries found heat waves increase
  cardiovascular mortality by 11.7% (RR 1.117), with dose-response relationship by
  intensity (18.9% increase for high-intensity heat waves). Each 1 degree C temperature
  increase raises cardiovascular mortality by 2.1%. Elderly, women, tropical climate
  residents, and lower-income populations face elevated risk.

  equity_implications: Heat-related cardiovascular mortality reflects structural inequities
    in climate vulnerability. Low-income communities, communities of color, and elderly
    populations living in urban heat islands with poor housing and limited air conditioning
    face disproportionate risk. Climate adaptation requires structural investments
    in cooling centers, housing weatherization, green infrastructure, and early warning
    systems targeting vulnerable populations.
assumptions:
- Heat wave definitions vary across studies but generally indicate sustained extreme
  temperatures
- Cardiovascular mortality includes stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure,
  arrhythmia deaths
- Effect is acute (days to weeks) rather than chronic exposure
limitations:
- Heat wave definitions not standardized across studies
- Publication bias possible toward significant findings
- Effect modification by acclimatization not fully characterized
- Most studies from higher-income countries
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Heat wave impacts vary by baseline climate, acclimatization, infrastructure,
    and population vulnerability.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Tropical and subtropical regions show elevated risk
  - Urban heat islands amplify exposure
  - Regions with limited air conditioning infrastructure most vulnerable
