direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater physical accessibility to off-premise alcohol outlets (shorter
  drive times) increases structural opportunities for alcohol purchase'
- 'Step 2: Reduced travel barriers lower the transaction costs and effort required
  to obtain alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Increased convenience and exposure to alcohol retail environments normalize
  alcohol purchase behaviors at the community level'
- 'Step 4: Higher neighborhood-level alcohol availability increases population-level
  consumption patterns, resulting in elevated prevalence of high-volume drinking'

  description: The association between alcohol availability and use varies substantially
    between the 15 major Ontario cities studied, with some cities showing positive
    associations and others negative, suggesting local sociodemographic characteristics
    and built environment context strongly moderate this relationship.
