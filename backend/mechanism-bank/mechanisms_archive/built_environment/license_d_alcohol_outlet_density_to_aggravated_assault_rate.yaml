direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of off premises alcohol outlets (liquor stores) increases
  alcohol availability for consumption in public and private spaces'
- 'Step 2: Liquor stores may become hotspots for loitering and social congregation
  in neighborhoods with limited alternative gathering spaces'
- 'Step 3: Concentrated alcohol purchasing and consumption in areas around liquor
  stores increases intoxication rates in public spaces'
- 'Step 4: Public intoxication and congregation around outlets increases opportunities
  for interpersonal conflicts that escalate to aggravated assault'
