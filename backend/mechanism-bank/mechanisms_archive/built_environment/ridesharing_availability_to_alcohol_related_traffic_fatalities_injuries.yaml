mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Introduction of ridesharing service increases availability of alternative
  transportation options'
- 'Step 2: Lower barriers (cost, convenience) to accessing safe transportation after
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Potential substitution of personal vehicle use with ridesharing among alcohol
  consumers'
- 'Step 4: Reduced incidence of alcohol-impaired driving and related crashes'
