mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Household air pollution contains particulate matter and toxic compounds'
- 'Step 2: Children''s developing respiratory systems are more vulnerable to pollutant exposure'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory response in airways and lung tissue from pollutant inhalation'
- 'Step 4: Compromised immune function and increased susceptibility to respiratory pathogens'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of acute respiratory infections and respiratory symptoms'

description: Household air pollution directly increases respiratory morbidity in children through inflammatory
  responses and compromised immune function, with children under five being particularly vulnerable.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how environmental injustice operates through housing
    - families with fewer economic resources are forced into housing with poor air quality, creating health
    disparities from early childhood. The pathway from structural poverty to child health operates through
    environmental exposure, demonstrating how housing is a fundamental determinant of health equity.
