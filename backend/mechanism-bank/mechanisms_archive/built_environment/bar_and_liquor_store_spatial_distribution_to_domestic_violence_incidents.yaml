mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol outlets (bars and liquor stores) are spatially distributed in communities,
  with higher concentrations often in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Proximity to alcohol outlets increases accessibility and frequency of alcohol
  purchases'
- 'Step 3: During COVID-19, easy access to liquor stores enabled continued alcohol
  acquisition for home consumption'
- 'Step 4: High-resolution microdata on outlet visits reveals that geographic proximity
  patterns contribute to localized domestic violence incident patterns through 911
  calls'
