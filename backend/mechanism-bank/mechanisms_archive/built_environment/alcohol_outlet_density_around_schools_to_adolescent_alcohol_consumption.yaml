  node_id: adolescent_alcohol_consumption
  node_name: Adolescent Alcohol Consumption
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets around schools increases physical availability
  and access to alcohol for adolescents'
- 'Step 2: Increased exposure to alcohol retail environments normalizes alcohol consumption
  and increases marketing exposure'
- 'Step 3: Greater accessibility reduces barriers to obtaining alcohol, facilitating
  drinking initiation and regular consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Concentrated retail presence creates social norms around alcohol availability
  in youth environments'

  description: Higher population density areas show greater differences in outlet
    density measurements, suggesting more concentrated exposure in dense urban environments

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Areas with higher street connectivity show greater methodological differences
    in measuring outlet density, indicating more complex exposure patterns

  description: Downtown areas show the widest differences between measurement methods,
    suggesting highest outlet density concentrations

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Areas with higher density of recreational venues predict disagreement
    between measurement methods, indicating clustering of alcohol access points
