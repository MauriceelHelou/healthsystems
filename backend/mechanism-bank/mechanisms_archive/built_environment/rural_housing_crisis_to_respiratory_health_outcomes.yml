mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural housing crisis creates widespread availability of only substandard or unaffordable housing
  options'
- 'Step 2: Limited housing market forces residents to accept poor quality housing with safety concerns
  and maintenance issues'
- 'Step 3: Substandard housing conditions expose residents to respiratory irritants, allergens, and poor
  indoor air quality'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure to poor housing conditions leads to development and exacerbation of respiratory
  conditions including asthma and allergies'

description: The rural housing crisis, characterized by growing homelessness and substandard housing due
  to inability to afford repairs, negatively impacts respiratory health outcomes in affected communities

  description: Growing homelessness in rural areas compounds the housing crisis and creates additional
    respiratory health risks
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism captures the systemic nature of rural housing inequality and its
    health consequences. The housing crisis reflects broader economic disinvestment in rural communities
    and historical patterns of marginalization. This structural framing avoids individual blame and focuses
    on policy-relevant housing system failures that require structural solutions.
