- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates residential uncertainty and frequent relocation for ACB people
  living with HIV'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing disrupts continuity of care relationships and access to consistent healthcare
  providers'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted healthcare access constrains engagement and retention in HIV healthcare services'
- 'Step 4: Poor healthcare engagement reduces adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)'
- 'Step 5: Reduced ART adherence increases uncertainty of achieving and maintaining viral undetectability'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces housing instability to structural violence and discriminatory
    policies rather than individual housing choices. It demonstrates how housing as a structural determinant
    creates cascading effects on health outcomes through healthcare system interactions, highlighting
    the need for policy interventions addressing root causes of housing inequity for ACB communities.
