- 'Step 1: Off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores) increase
  alcohol availability for home consumption'
- 'Step 2: Greater accessibility to take-home alcohol may facilitate problematic drinking
  patterns in private settings'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol consumption in home environments elevates parental intoxication
  and impaired judgment'
- 'Step 4: However, in this Spanish context, after controlling for neighborhood characteristics,
  off-premise density showed no significant relationship with child maltreatment'

  description: Mediterranean drinking culture, where alcohol is typically consumed
    with meals and in social contexts, may weaken the relationship between off-premise
    outlet density and home drinking problems compared to cultures with different
    consumption patterns.
