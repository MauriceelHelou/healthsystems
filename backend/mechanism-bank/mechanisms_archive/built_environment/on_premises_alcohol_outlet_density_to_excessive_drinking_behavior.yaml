direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets increases physical accessibility and
  availability of alcohol in the neighborhood environment'
- 'Step 2: Greater accessibility reduces barriers (time, distance, effort) to obtaining
  alcohol for on-premises consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced barriers and increased environmental cues (signage, establishments)
  normalize and facilitate alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Facilitated access and normalized consumption increase population-level
  rates of excessive drinking in the geographic area'
