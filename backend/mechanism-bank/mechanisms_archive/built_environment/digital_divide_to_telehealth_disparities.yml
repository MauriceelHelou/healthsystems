mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical underinvestment in telecommunications infrastructure creates broadband deserts in rural and low-income areas'
- 'Step 2: Limited broadband prevents video-based telehealth, restricting care to audio-only or in-person visits'
- 'Step 3: Lack of devices (smartphones, tablets, computers) compounds infrastructure gaps'
- 'Step 4: During health crises like COVID-19, populations without digital access cannot shift to virtual care'
- 'Step 5: Care gaps widen as digitally-connected populations maintain access while disconnected populations face barriers'

description: The digital divide creates systematic barriers to telehealth access that disproportionately affect rural, elderly, non-English-speaking, and low-income populations. A 2024 systematic review found that despite rapid telehealth adoption during COVID-19, the technology did not reduce existing disparities in access to care. The five-dimension framework (access, availability, adequacy, acceptability, affordability) helps identify where digital exclusion creates health inequities.

  equity_implications: Digital divide compounds existing health disparities through structural underinvestment. Rural areas lack infrastructure due to lower return on investment for telecommunications companies. Low-income households face affordability barriers for both connectivity and devices. Policy must address infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy simultaneously.
assumptions:
- Digital divide includes both infrastructure access and device ownership
- Telehealth disparities measured by utilization rates and care quality
- Assumes telehealth would improve access if barriers removed
limitations:
- Digital literacy barriers persist even with infrastructure access
- Some populations prefer in-person care regardless of digital access
- Rapid technology changes may create new forms of digital exclusion
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Rural and tribal areas face infrastructure gaps; low-income urban areas face affordability gaps
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural Appalachia and Great Plains have lowest broadband access rates
  - Tribal reservations face both regulatory and investment barriers
  - Low-income urban areas may have infrastructure but face cost barriers
