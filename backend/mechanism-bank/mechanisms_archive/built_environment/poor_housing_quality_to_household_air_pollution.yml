mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing quality involves inadequate ventilation systems and building materials'
- 'Step 2: Insufficient air circulation traps pollutants from cooking, heating, and outdoor sources'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate building materials fail to provide barriers against external pollutants'
- 'Step 4: Concentration of particulate matter and toxic compounds increases indoors'
- 'Step 5: Elevated household air pollution exposure for all residents'

description: Poor housing quality directly contributes to household air pollution through inadequate ventilation
  and building materials that fail to protect against or properly manage indoor air quality.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how housing policy failures and inadequate building
    standards create environmental health hazards. Poor housing quality reflects broader structural inequities
    including poverty, lack of urban planning, weak building code enforcement, and insufficient investment
    in affordable quality housing. The burden falls disproportionately on low-income families who cannot
    access better housing options.
