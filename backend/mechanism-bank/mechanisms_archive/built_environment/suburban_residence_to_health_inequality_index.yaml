- 'Step 1: Suburban areas are characterized by historical patterns of disinvestment
  in infrastructure, healthcare facilities, and economic development'
- 'Step 2: Geographic marginalization creates concentration of low income, low education,
  and high poverty populations'

  environments compounds health risks'
- 'Step 4: These structural disadvantages manifest as worse scores across all health
  and socioeconomic indicators in the composite Health Inequality Index'
