mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing insecurity leads to unstable living conditions with potential exposure to environmental
  triggers'
- 'Step 2: Poor housing quality often includes allergens, mold, pests, and inadequate ventilation'
- 'Step 3: These environmental factors trigger inflammatory responses in airways'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure to triggers leads to increased asthma symptoms and exacerbations'

  description: Children and adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to housing-related asthma triggers

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces housing insecurity to broader structural factors including
    housing policy, income inequality, and systemic disinvestment in affordable housing. It avoids blaming
    individuals and focuses on how structural conditions create differential health outcomes.
