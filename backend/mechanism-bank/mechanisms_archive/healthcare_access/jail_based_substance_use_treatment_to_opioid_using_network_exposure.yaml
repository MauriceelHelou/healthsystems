direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Jail-based treatment provides education about risks of maintaining relationships
  with active substance users'
- 'Step 2: Treatment programming creates space and time separated from substance-using
  contacts in the community'
- 'Step 3: Women in treatment develop skills and motivation to distance themselves
  from opioid-using network members'
- 'Step 4: Treatment participants report fewer network members who recently used opioids,
  reducing exposure to substance use triggers'
