category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Racial and ethnic minority patients diagnosed with obstructive hypertrophic
  cardiomyopathy seek treatment within healthcare systems'
- 'Step 2: Structural factors including geographic distribution of interventional
  cardiology services, insurance network limitations, and referral bias create differential
  access to alcohol septal ablation procedures'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol septal ablation, as a less invasive alternative to surgical myectomy,
  is disproportionately unavailable to minority patients due to concentration of this
  specialized procedure in academic centers and affluent geographic areas'
- 'Step 4: Minority patients experience reduced access specifically to this catheter-based
  intervention option, limiting treatment choices'
