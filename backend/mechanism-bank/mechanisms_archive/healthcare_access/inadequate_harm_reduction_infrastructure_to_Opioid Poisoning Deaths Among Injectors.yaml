direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited availability of drug treatment services and harm reduction programs
  reduces access to supervised injection facilities, needle exchange programs, and
  medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 2: Absence of widespread overdose prevention strategies (e.g., naloxone distribution,
  overdose recognition training) means bystanders cannot effectively intervene during
  overdose events'
- 'Step 3: Insufficient integration of services for homeless populations and people
  who inject drugs creates gaps in care continuity'
- 'Step 4: These structural gaps in healthcare infrastructure result in preventable
  opioid poisoning deaths, particularly in contexts of polydrug use'

  description: 41% of single opioid poisoning deaths occurred when person was not
    alone, but deaths still occurred, suggesting lack of training or naloxone access
    among bystanders
- name: polydrug_use_pattern
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: 62% of opioid deaths involved polydrug use, which is more difficult
    to manage without comprehensive harm reduction services and may require more intensive
    overdose prevention strategies
- name: housing_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: 19% homelessness rate among decedents indicates that lack of stable
    housing intersects with inadequate service access to compound mortality risk
