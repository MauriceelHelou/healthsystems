mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary health care units implement systematic alcohol screening protocols
  to identify heavy drinkers who would otherwise remain undetected'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention provides structured 5-minute counseling and educational
  materials immediately following positive screening'
- 'Step 3: Early identification and intervention prevents progression to more severe
  alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in AUDIT-C scores reflects decreased alcohol consumption patterns'
