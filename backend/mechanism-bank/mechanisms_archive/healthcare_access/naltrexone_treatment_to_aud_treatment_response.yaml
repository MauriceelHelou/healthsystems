direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Naltrexone is administered as pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder
  management'
- 'Step 2: Reward-driven drinkers show differential neurobiological response to opioid
  antagonism'
- 'Step 3: Naltrexone blocks opioid receptors, reducing rewarding effects of alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: This leads to improved treatment outcomes in specific patient subgroups'
