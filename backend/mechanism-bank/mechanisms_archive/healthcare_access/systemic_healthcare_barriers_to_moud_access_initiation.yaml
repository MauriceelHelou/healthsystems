mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Populations face systemic barriers including geographic isolation, lack
  of transportation, insurance/payment requirements, and stigmatizing clinical environments'
- 'Step 2: Fixed-site MOUD providers require travel, documentation, scheduled appointments,
  and navigation of complex healthcare systems'
- 'Step 3: These structural obstacles create differential access to MOUD based on
  geographic location, economic resources, and social marginalization'
- 'Step 4: Reduced MOUD access leads to lower treatment initiation rates among populations
  with greatest opioid use disorder burden'
