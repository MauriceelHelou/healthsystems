direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of culturally appropriate AOD services creates cultural dissonance
  and lack of safety for Indigenous Australians seeking treatment'
- 'Step 2: Cultural disconnection reduces trust in treatment providers and undermines
  therapeutic relationships necessary for sustained engagement'
- 'Step 3: Indigenous peoples experience services as alienating or discriminatory,
  leading to premature discontinuation or avoidance of AOD treatment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment engagement results in poorer substance use outcomes and
  continued health disparities'
