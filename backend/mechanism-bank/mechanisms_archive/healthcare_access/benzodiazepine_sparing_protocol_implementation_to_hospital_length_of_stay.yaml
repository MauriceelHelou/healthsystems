mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Protocol implementation changes medication approach to alcohol withdrawal
  but maintains overall safety and efficacy'
- 'Step 2: Reduced withdrawal severity and lower benzodiazepine exposure do not translate
  to significantly shorter hospital stays in this trauma population'
- 'Step 3: Length of stay driven by multiple factors including injury severity, complications,
  and discharge planning rather than withdrawal management alone'
- 'Step 4: Protocol demonstrates safety equivalence without increasing hospital resource
  utilization'
