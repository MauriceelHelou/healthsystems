direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Drug treatment court policies determine whether MAT is available and supported
  as a treatment option for opioid-involved participants'
- 'Step 2: When MAT is accessible within the court system, participants with opioid
  use disorder can obtain evidence-based pharmacotherapy (buprenorphine, naltrexone,
  or methadone)'
- 'Step 3: Access to MAT reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings, facilitating engagement
  in treatment and court requirements'
- 'Step 4: Sustained MAT engagement supports recovery processes and adherence to court
  program expectations'
