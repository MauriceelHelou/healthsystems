- 'Step 1: Drug court programs provide structured access to substance use disorder
  treatment and support services'
- 'Step 2: Non-graduation typically results in incarceration rather than continued
  treatment access'
- 'Step 3: Incarceration disrupts treatment continuity and reduces access to evidence-based
  substance use interventions'
- 'Step 4: Loss of treatment access and incarceration-related stress exacerbate substance
  use disorders and related health complications'
