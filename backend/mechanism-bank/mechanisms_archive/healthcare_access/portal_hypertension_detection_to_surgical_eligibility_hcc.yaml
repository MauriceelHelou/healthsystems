direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Portal hypertension status is a critical determinant of surgical eligibility
  and post-operative complication risk'
- 'Step 2: Access to diagnostic procedures (hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement,
  imaging) required to assess portal hypertension varies by healthcare setting'
- 'Step 3: Lack of portal hypertension assessment may lead to inappropriate treatment
  selection or missed opportunities for optimal intervention'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare infrastructure determines whether comprehensive pre-treatment
  evaluation including portal hypertension assessment is standard of care'
