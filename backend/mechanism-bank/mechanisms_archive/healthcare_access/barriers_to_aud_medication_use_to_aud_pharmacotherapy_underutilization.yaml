direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system structures create multiple barriers including provider
  knowledge gaps, prescribing restrictions, and organizational policies'
- 'Step 2: Patient-level barriers including stigma, access to care, and awareness
  compound system-level barriers'
- 'Step 3: Barriers operate at multiple levels (patient, provider, organizational,
  policy) simultaneously'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effect of multilevel barriers results in low utilization of
  effective AUD medications despite their availability'
