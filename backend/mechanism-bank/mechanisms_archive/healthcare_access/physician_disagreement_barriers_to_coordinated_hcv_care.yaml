mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of consensus among SerD physicians about barriers to health care prevents
  unified approach to addressing system issues'
- 'Step 2: Divergent perspectives on problems lead to inconsistent prioritization
  of solutions and resource allocation'
- 'Step 3: Absence of shared understanding impedes development of coordinated strategies
  for improving HCV care delivery'
- 'Step 4: Fragmented approach to care results in variable service quality and reduced
  treatment access for PWID'
