mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with insomnia and prescription sleep aids are provided with objective
  sleep tracking technology (Fitbit Charge 2)'
- 'Step 2: Sleep data are collected continuously and made available through digital
  platform (SleepLife app)'
- 'Step 3: Objective sleep metrics provide patients with quantifiable feedback on
  sleep patterns and quality'
- 'Step 4: Despite low physician engagement with data portal, patients show improved
  sleep outcomes through self-monitoring and awareness'
