  node_name: AUD Diagnosis in Black Male Veterans
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intersectional stereotypes about Black men and substance use are deeply
  embedded in clinical training, media representations, and institutional cultures
  within healthcare and criminal justice systems'
- 'Step 2: These racialized and gendered assumptions lead to heightened surveillance
  and more intensive screening of Black male veterans for substance use problems'
- 'Step 3: When Black male veterans report alcohol consumption at equivalent levels
  to White male veterans, providers are more likely to interpret this as pathological
  and warranting a formal diagnosis'
- 'Step 4: The combination of stereotype-driven clinical judgment and differential
  diagnostic threshold application results in Black male veterans experiencing substantially
  elevated odds (23%-109%) of receiving AUD diagnoses across most consumption levels'
