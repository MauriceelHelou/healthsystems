mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Remote geographic locations create physical barriers to reaching health
  facilities'
- 'Step 2: Traditional mhGAP requires 4-6 in-person clinic sessions which necessitates
  multiple trips'
- 'Step 3: Transportation costs, time away from work, and travel burden limit feasibility
  of completing multi-session in-person interventions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to evidence-based alcohol treatment leads to untreated unhealthy
  alcohol use'
