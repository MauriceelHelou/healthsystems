mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with problematic substance use present to ED without access to
  addiction treatment'
- 'Step 2: ED addresses acute medical crisis but patient remains disconnected from
  addiction services'
- 'Step 3: Underlying substance use disorder remains untreated after ED discharge'
- 'Step 4: Patient experiences subsequent crisis requiring return ED visit within
  7 days (28% of cohort)'
- 'Step 5: Cycle continues without intervention, creating pattern of recurrent high-acuity
  healthcare utilization'
