category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Methadone continuation during incarceration prevents tolerance loss that
  occurs with forced abstinence during detention'
- 'Step 2: Maintained tolerance reduces vulnerability to overdose from lower doses
  of illicit opioids upon release'
- 'Step 3: Treatment continuation facilitates smoother transition to community treatment,
  reducing the high-risk period of treatment gap'
- 'Step 4: Sustained medication management during incarceration provides protective
  physiological effects immediately post-release when overdose risk is highest'
