mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of validated clinical decision rule (PediBIRN-4) in pediatric
  emergency department settings provides systematic screening framework'
- 'Step 2: Four-variable screening criteria applied to children under 3 years with
  bruising and acute head trauma enables structured assessment'
- 'Step 3: High sensitivity screening (96%) allows for detection of vast majority
  of abusive head trauma cases that present to emergency departments'
- 'Step 4: Early identification in ED setting enables timely intervention, child protection,
  and prevention of further harm'
