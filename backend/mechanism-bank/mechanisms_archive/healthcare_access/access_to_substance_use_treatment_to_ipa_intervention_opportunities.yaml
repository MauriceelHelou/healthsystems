mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol and drug services provide contact points for men using substances
  who may be perpetrating IPA'
- 'Step 2: Pathway-specific assessment can identify heterogeneous trajectories (rule-breaking,
  entrenched use, or relationship insecurity)'
- 'Step 3: Tailored interventions target specific core features and predisposing factors
  relevant to each pathway grouping'
- 'Step 4: Addressing substance use in context of pathway-specific factors creates
  opportunities to reduce IPA perpetration'
