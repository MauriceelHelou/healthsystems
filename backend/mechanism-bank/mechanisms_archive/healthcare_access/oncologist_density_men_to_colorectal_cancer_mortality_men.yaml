direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher oncologist density indicates greater healthcare resource concentration
  in geographic areas'
- 'Step 2: Areas with more oncologists may attract patients with more advanced disease
  seeking specialized care'
- 'Step 3: Higher concentration of advanced cases in specialized centers increases
  observed mortality rates in those regions'
- 'Step 4: This represents a supply-induced demand or referral pattern rather than
  causal harm from oncologist availability'
