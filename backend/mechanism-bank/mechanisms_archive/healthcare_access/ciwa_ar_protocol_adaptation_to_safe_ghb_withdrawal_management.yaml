direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CIWA-Ar scale (validated for alcohol withdrawal) is adapted to assess GHB
  withdrawal severity'
- 'Step 2: Standardized scoring provides objective guidance for symptom-triggered
  benzodiazepine dosing'
- 'Step 3: Fixed and symptom-triggered benzodiazepine regimen based on CIWA-Ar scores
  enables responsive treatment titration'
- 'Step 4: Systematic assessment and dosing protocol results in successful management
  of severe GHB withdrawal delirium'
