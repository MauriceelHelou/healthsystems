direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sulfonamide-derivative drugs (including torasemide) share chemical structural
  features with known EGPA-triggering sulfonamides'
- 'Step 2: Drug exposure in susceptible individuals activates eosinophilic and neutrophilic
  immune responses'
- 'Step 3: Immune activation leads to perivascular infiltration, neutrophil nuclear
  fragmentation, and fibrinous necrosis of small vessels'
- 'Step 4: Systemic vasculitis manifests across multiple organ systems (skin, lungs,
  peripheral nerves) in patients with underlying EGPA predisposition'

  description: Bronchial asthma is a core feature of EGPA and indicates Th2-skewed
    immune system predisposed to eosinophilic responses. All EGPA patients by definition
    have asthma history
- name: leukotriene_receptor_antagonist_use
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Strongest drug association with EGPA occurrence is leukotriene receptor
    antagonists (montelukast, zafirlukast, pranlukast), though paradoxically used
    to treat asthma which is an EGPA feature
- name: dose_timing_exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Prior leukocytoclastic vasculitis cases from torasemide developed within
    24 hours of administration; this case showed 7-10 day progression, suggesting
    dose-response or cumulative exposure effects
