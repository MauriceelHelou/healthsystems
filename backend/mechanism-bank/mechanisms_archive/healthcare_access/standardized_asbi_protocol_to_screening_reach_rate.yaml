- 'Step 1: Implementation of standardized WHO manualised screening protocol provides
  systematic approach across primary health care units'
- 'Step 2: Cluster randomization at unit level ensures organizational commitment to
  screening procedures'
- 'Step 3: Defined eligibility criteria and systematic screening increases identification
  of heavy drinkers who would be missed by opportunistic screening'
- 'Step 4: Increased reach measured by rates of eligible patients screened and received
  advice'
