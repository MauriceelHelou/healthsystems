- 'Step 1: MAT pharmacologically reduces alcohol cravings and withdrawal severity'
- 'Step 2: Decreased alcohol consumption reduces risk of severe intoxication, withdrawal
  seizures, and other acute complications requiring hospitalization'
- 'Step 3: Outpatient MAT provides regular monitoring and intervention before substance
  use escalates to crisis levels'
- 'Step 4: Sustained treatment engagement replaces pattern of crisis-driven inpatient
  detoxification admissions'
