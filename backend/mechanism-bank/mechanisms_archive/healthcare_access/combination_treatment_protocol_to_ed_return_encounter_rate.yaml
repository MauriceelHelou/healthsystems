category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency departments implement combination treatment protocols using both
  phenobarbital and benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal management'
- 'Step 2: Combination therapy provides synergistic effects through multiple mechanisms
  of GABA receptor modulation, achieving more comprehensive symptom control'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced pharmacological management addresses both immediate withdrawal
  symptoms and provides longer-term stabilization'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience even greater reduction in need for return emergency
  care within 3 days compared to either medication alone'
