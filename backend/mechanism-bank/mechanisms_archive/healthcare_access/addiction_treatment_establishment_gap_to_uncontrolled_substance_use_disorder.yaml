direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system provides referrals to addiction treatment (65% of SUD
  patients received referrals)'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers prevent treatment establishment including fragmented
  care delivery, insurance limitations, geographic access challenges, and lack of
  integrated services'
- 'Step 3: Only 35% of referred patients establish addiction treatment, leaving 65%
  of those referred without documented treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Patients with cirrhosis and SUD continue substance use without adequate
  treatment support, perpetuating liver damage and complications'

  description: Nearly all patients with clinically-recognized SUD underwent social
    work evaluation during hospitalization, which facilitated referrals but was insufficient
    to ensure treatment establishment
