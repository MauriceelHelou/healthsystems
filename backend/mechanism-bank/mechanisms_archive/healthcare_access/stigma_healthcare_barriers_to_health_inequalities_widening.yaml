direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stigma and healthcare barriers prevent disadvantaged populations from accessing
  Long Covid diagnosis and care'
- 'Step 2: Lack of diagnosis and treatment leads to symptom progression and functional
  decline in marginalized groups'
- 'Step 3: Advantaged populations with resources to overcome barriers receive care
  while disadvantaged populations remain untreated'
- 'Step 4: Differential access to care creates diverging health trajectories, widening
  existing health inequalities'
