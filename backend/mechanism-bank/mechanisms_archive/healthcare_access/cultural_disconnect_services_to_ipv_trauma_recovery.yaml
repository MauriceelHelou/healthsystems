  South Asian cultural values, religious practices, and family structures'
- 'Step 2: Cultural disconnect creates mistrust and reduces perceived relevance of
  available services among South Asian immigrant IPV survivors'

  including counseling, legal advocacy, and safety planning'
- 'Step 4: Decreased access to professional support impedes trauma recovery processes'
