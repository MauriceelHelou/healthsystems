  node_name: MOUD Facility Availability
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural areas have lower population density and fewer healthcare facilities
  overall, including MOUD treatment providers'
- 'Step 2: Economic disincentives and workforce shortages limit establishment of MOUD
  facilities in low-density rural areas'
- 'Step 3: Rural areas become dependent on single critical access providers with no
  proximate alternatives'
- 'Step 4: Loss of critical access facility leaves rural populations with substantially
  increased distances to nearest MOUD treatment'
