direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patient with severe WKS admitted to specialized neurorehabilitation center
  with complete dependence on care staff for all activities of daily living'
- 'Step 2: 26 months of intensive neurocognitive training and psychological treatment
  provided in specialized inpatient setting'
- 'Step 3: Gradual improvement in cognitive function and ADL independence through
  structured rehabilitation'
- 'Step 4: Skills and strategies learned translate to real-world functioning, enabling
  community living and sheltered work'
- 'Step 5: Sustained and further improved cognitive function observed at 3-year and
  7-year follow-ups (e.g., Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test improving from <1 percentile
  to rank 16 for recognition and rank 5 for recall)'
