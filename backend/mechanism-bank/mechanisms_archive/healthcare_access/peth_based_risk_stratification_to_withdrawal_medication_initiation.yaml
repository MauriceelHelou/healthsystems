direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PEth biomarker testing on admission provides objective measure of alcohol
  exposure and withdrawal risk'
- 'Step 2: Higher PEth levels identify patients who will likely reach AWS score of
  6 or more (medication threshold)'
- 'Step 3: Early risk stratification enables proactive medication planning rather
  than reactive treatment'
- 'Step 4: Appropriate early medication initiation prevents progression to severe
  withdrawal complications including seizures and delirium tremens'
