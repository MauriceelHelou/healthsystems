- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates operational disruptions and safety concerns in
  healthcare facilities'
- 'Step 2: Buprenorphine clinics reduce capacity or restrict patient populations,
  particularly vulnerable groups'
- 'Step 3: Clinics that previously accepted pregnant patients for OUD treatment discontinue
  this service (33% reduction)'
- 'Step 4: Pregnant patients with OUD lose access to medication-assisted treatment,
  increasing risk of untreated opioid use disorder'
