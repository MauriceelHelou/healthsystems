mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Research on pharmacological treatments for co-occurring PTSD and SUD concentrates
  on veteran populations and males'
- 'Step 2: Structural resource allocation decisions prioritize veteran health systems
  and male-dominated samples in clinical trials'
- 'Step 3: Evidence base becomes limited for civilian populations, women, and diverse
  gender identities'
- 'Step 4: Lack of evidence prevents clinicians from confidently prescribing pharmacological
  treatments to under-researched populations'
- 'Step 5: Treatment disparities persist for non-veteran, female, and gender-diverse
  individuals with co-occurring PTSD and SUD'
