mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Literacy-adapted electronic tools are designed specifically for diverse,
  underserved patient populations with varying literacy levels'
- 'Step 2: These tools enable patients to self-assess family history in a format they
  can navigate and understand, overcoming traditional clinician-collection barriers'
- 'Step 3: Successful family history collection provides the necessary information
  for hereditary cancer syndrome risk assessment'
- 'Step 4: Adequate risk assessment facilitates appropriate genetics referrals that
  would otherwise not occur in underserved populations'
