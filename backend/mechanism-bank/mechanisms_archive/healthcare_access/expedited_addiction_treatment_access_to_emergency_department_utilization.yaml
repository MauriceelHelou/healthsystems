mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rapid connection to addiction medicine clinic provides patients with designated
  point of care for substance use disorder management, reducing reliance on emergency
  department for crisis-driven care'
- 'Step 2: Early treatment engagement facilitates medication-assisted treatment initiation
  and stabilization, reducing acute complications of untreated substance use disorders
  (overdose, withdrawal, infections)'
- 'Step 3: Established care relationship provides alternative to emergency department
  for urgent needs, with clinic serving as medical home for addiction-related concerns'
- 'Step 4: Continuity of care through addiction medicine clinic prevents escalation
  of health crises that would otherwise result in emergency presentations'
