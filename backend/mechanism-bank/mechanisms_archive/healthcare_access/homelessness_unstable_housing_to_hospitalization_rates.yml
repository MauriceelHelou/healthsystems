- 'Step 1: Housing instability disrupts routine cardiovascular disease management and medication adherence'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to environmental stressors and poor living conditions exacerbates cardiovascular conditions'
- 'Step 3: Barriers to outpatient care result in progression of cardiovascular disease to more severe
  stages'
- 'Step 4: Acute cardiovascular complications require hospitalization due to lack of preventive care'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how housing instability creates a cascade from reduced
    preventive care to increased acute care utilization. The pattern reflects structural inequities where
    inadequate housing policies and healthcare access barriers compound to produce worse health outcomes
    and higher healthcare costs for vulnerable populations.
