direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased clinician intent to implement screening and brief intervention
  translates to actual practice changes in primary care settings'
- 'Step 2: More consistent implementation of evidence-based screening tools (e.g.,
  adolescent screening instruments, validated alcohol use measures) increases case
  identification'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced screening rates lead to increased diagnosis of substance use disorders
  previously undetected in primary care'
- 'Step 4: Earlier identification enables timely intervention and treatment initiation,
  addressing the structural gap where few SUD patients are currently diagnosed and
  treated in primary care settings'
