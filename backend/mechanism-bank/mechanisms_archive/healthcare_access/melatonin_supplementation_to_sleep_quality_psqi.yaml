- 'Step 1: Melatonin administration exerts chronobiotic effects, regulating circadian
  rhythm disruption in COMISA patients'
- 'Step 2: Antioxidant properties of melatonin reduce oxidative stress associated
  with sleep fragmentation'
- 'Step 3: Improved sleep architecture reduces nighttime awakenings and decreases
  sleep latency'
- 'Step 4: Overall sleep quality improves as measured by reduction in PSQI scores'
