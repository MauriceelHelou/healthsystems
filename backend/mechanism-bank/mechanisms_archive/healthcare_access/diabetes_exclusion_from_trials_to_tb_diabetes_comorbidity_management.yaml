mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: 30% of TB trials explicitly exclude people with diabetes, and even trials
  allowing enrollment significantly under-enroll this population (9% enrolled vs 16%
  global prevalence)'
- 'Step 2: Diabetes affects immune function and TB treatment outcomes, but trials
  fail to capture these interactions'
- 'Step 3: Evidence gaps emerge regarding drug-drug interactions (rifampin and diabetes
  medications), adverse event profiles, and treatment efficacy in people with diabetes'
- 'Step 4: Clinical guidelines lack adequate evidence for managing TB-diabetes comorbidity'
- 'Step 5: People with diabetes experience suboptimal TB treatment outcomes due to
  lack of tailored, evidence-based approaches'
