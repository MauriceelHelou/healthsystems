direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Academic detailing program provides structured education and support to
  healthcare providers about evidence-based medications for alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Provider knowledge and awareness of pharmacotherapy options (naltrexone,
  acamprosate, disulfiram, topiramate) increases through direct educational encounters'
- 'Step 3: Increased provider knowledge translates to more active consideration and
  prescription of medications as standard of care'
- 'Step 4: Patients with clinically documented AUD gain access to pharmacotherapy
  previously underutilized due to knowledge gaps'
