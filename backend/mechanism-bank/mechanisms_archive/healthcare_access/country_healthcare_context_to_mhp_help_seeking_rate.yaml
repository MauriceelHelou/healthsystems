direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: National healthcare system structures, mental health service availability,
  and cultural norms around mental healthcare differ between Thailand and India'
- 'Step 2: In India, higher overall help-seeking rates (81% chose MHPs) suggest greater
  normalization of mental health services or better service availability/accessibility'
- 'Step 3: In Thailand, lower help-seeking from MHPs (66%) and lower overall help-seeking
  from any source suggests structural barriers including stigma, service availability,
  or access issues'
- 'Step 4: These country-level structural factors create differential rates of mental
  health service utilization among medical students'
