- 'Step 1: Lack of reliable transportation (no vehicle, limited transit, disability) creates physical
  barrier to healthcare'
- 'Step 2: Transportation costs and time burden force trade-offs with work, childcare, and other obligations'
- 'Step 3: Missed and delayed appointments lead to gaps in preventive care and chronic disease management'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare discontinuity results in disease progression, complications, and emergency care
  needs'
- 'Step 5: Reliance on emergency care for conditions treatable in primary care worsens outcomes and increases
  costs'

description: Transportation barriers are significant predictors of healthcare access problems including
  delayed appointments, missed primary care visits, and foregone vaccinations. In suburban areas, 34.5%
  of adults experienced transportation-related barriers. Those relying on public transit face 2x greater
  risk of access barriers. Virtual care and transportation assistance programs can mitigate these effects.

structural_competency:

  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Transportation barriers reflect structural inequities in urban planning, transit
    investment, and healthcare facility siting. Low-income communities and communities of color often
    have both worse transit access and fewer nearby healthcare facilities. Addressing transportation barriers
    requires investment in transit, healthcare in underserved areas, and transportation assistance programs.
assumptions:
- Transportation barrier defined as delayed/missed care or foregone services due to transportation
- Includes both lack of personal vehicle and inadequate public transit
- Applies to both urban and suburban/rural contexts with different mechanisms
limitations:
- Most studies from US and Canada; may not generalize globally
- Self-reported transportation barriers may underestimate true prevalence
- Difficult to separate transportation from other access barriers (cost, time)
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Transportation barriers vary dramatically by urban form, transit infrastructure, and
    healthcare facility distribution.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Suburban areas show high transportation barrier prevalence
  - Rural areas face distance-related barriers even with vehicle access
  - Cities with robust transit show lower transportation barriers
