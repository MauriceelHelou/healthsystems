mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Protocol-guided alcohol withdrawal management reduces need for mechanical
  ventilation by preventing severe respiratory compromise'
- 'Step 2: Decreased mechanical ventilation exposure reduces risk of ventilator-associated
  complications including aspiration and nosocomial infection'
- 'Step 3: Shorter duration of sedation and reduced intubation lowers opportunity
  for bacterial colonization of airways'
- 'Step 4: Combined reduction in ventilation and airway manipulation decreases incidence
  of ICU-related pneumonia'
