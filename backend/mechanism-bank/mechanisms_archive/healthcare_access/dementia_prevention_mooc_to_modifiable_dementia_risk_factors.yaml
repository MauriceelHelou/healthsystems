mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structured 4-week online course provides comprehensive education on modifiable
  dementia risk factors'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced knowledge about dementia risk mediates behavior change (12% mediation
  effect)'
- 'Step 3: Course engagement enables development of self-efficacy for behavior modification'
- 'Step 4: Participants implement risk reduction behaviors across multiple domains
  (cardiometabolic health, physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, smoking, alcohol)'
