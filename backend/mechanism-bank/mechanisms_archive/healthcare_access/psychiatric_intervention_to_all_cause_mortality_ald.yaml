- 'Step 1: Psychiatric intervention (consultation with psychiatrists or medication
  for alcohol use disorder) addresses underlying mental health comorbidities in ALD
  patients'
- 'Step 2: Treatment of psychiatric comorbidities and alcohol use disorder reduces
  harmful alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol exposure decreases progression of liver damage and improves
  overall health status'
- 'Step 4: Integrated medical-psychiatric management improves medication adherence
  and health-seeking behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects result in reduced all-cause mortality in ALD patients'
