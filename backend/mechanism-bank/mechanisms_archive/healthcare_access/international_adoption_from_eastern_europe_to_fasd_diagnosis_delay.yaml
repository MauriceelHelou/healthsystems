direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children from Eastern European orphanages experience both prenatal alcohol
  exposure and post-natal abandonment/institutional care'
- 'Step 2: Mixed neurodevelopmental and behavioral signs from multiple exposures complicate
  clinical picture'
- 'Step 3: Lack of expertise in diagnosing FASD among healthcare providers delays
  recognition'
- 'Step 4: Inability to confirm maternal alcohol consumption history in adopted children
  creates diagnostic uncertainty'
- 'Step 5: Delayed diagnosis prevents timely intervention and support services'
