category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: 60 days of chronic alcohol intoxication creates more severe metabolic and
  immune dysfunction when combined with acute pancreatitis'
- 'Step 2: Heptral/Glutoxim/Mexidol combination normalizes 17.6% and corrects 67.6%
  of altered parameters'
- 'Step 3: Phosphogliv/Hypoxen/Hepon combination normalizes only 11.8% and corrects
  38.2% of parameters'
- 'Step 4: Longer duration alcohol exposure reduces overall normalization rates but
  optimal drug combinations still show superior correction'

  description: Heptral/Glutoxim/Mexidol remains more effective than alternative combinations
    even with prolonged alcohol exposure, though overall normalization rates decline
- name: alcohol_exposure_duration
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: 60 days of alcohol exposure versus 30 days substantially reduces normalization
    rates (17.6% vs 57.8%) even with optimal treatment, indicating more refractory
    disease
