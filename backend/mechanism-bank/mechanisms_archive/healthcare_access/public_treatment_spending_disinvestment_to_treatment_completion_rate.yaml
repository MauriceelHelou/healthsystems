  million disinvested, 27% decrease)'
- 'Step 2: Decreased treatment quality, intensity, or duration due to resource constraints
  affecting staffing ratios, program components, or supportive services'

  and continuity of care'
- 'Step 4: Fewer adults able to successfully complete treatment programs (21% reduction
  in successful completions concurrent with disinvestment)'
