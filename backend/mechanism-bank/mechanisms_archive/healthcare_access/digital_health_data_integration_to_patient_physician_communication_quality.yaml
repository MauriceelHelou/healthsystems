direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep tracking technology generates objective patient health data through
  SleepLife platform'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare system lacks infrastructure or workflow integration for physicians
  to review patient-generated data (only 1 physician accessed portal)'
- 'Step 3: Patients expect improved communication based on shared objective data but
  physicians remain unable or unwilling to engage with the technology'
- 'Step 4: Mismatch between patient expectations and physician engagement leads to
  decreased patient satisfaction with communication and overall sleep health management'
