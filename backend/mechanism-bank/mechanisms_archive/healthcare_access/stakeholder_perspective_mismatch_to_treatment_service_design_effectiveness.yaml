mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Health workers prioritize knowledge barriers while people with lived experience
  prioritize structural, attitudinal, and experiential barriers'
- 'Step 2: Misalignment between provider and service user perspectives leads to interventions
  that address perceived rather than actual barriers'
- 'Step 3: Services designed based on provider assumptions (e.g., education-focused)
  fail to address primary barriers experienced by service users (stigma, service gaps,
  past trauma)'
- 'Step 4: Ineffective service design perpetuates low treatment engagement and poor
  outcomes, reinforcing cycle of unmet need'
