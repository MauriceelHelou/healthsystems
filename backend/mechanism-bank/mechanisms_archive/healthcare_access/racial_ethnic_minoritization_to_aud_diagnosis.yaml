direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism and implicit bias shape clinical decision-making in healthcare
  settings, leading providers to differentially apply diagnostic criteria'
- 'Step 2: Black and Hispanic veterans experience heightened scrutiny and stereotyping
  regarding substance use despite equivalent alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: Diagnostic thresholds are applied inconsistently, with minoritized veterans
  more likely to receive formal AUD diagnoses at similar or lower levels of alcohol
  consumption compared to White veterans'
- 'Step 4: This diagnostic bias becomes encoded in electronic health records, creating
  disparities in documented AUD prevalence that do not reflect actual differences
  in alcohol consumption behavior'
