structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural barriers that prevent effective chronic
    disease management among homeless populations, including lack of stable address for medication delivery,
    inability to store medications safely, and fragmented healthcare systems. The intervention provides
    systematic support rather than expecting individual behavior change in contexts of structural disadvantage.
