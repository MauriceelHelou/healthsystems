mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court staff knowledge and attitudes about opioid use disorder and MAT shape
  policies and practices regarding medication access'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced training increases staff understanding of MAT as evidence-based
  treatment rather than substitution therapy, reducing stigma and resistance'
- 'Step 3: Improved staff competency leads to better integration of MAT into court
  supervision practices and reduced barriers to medication access'
- 'Step 4: Higher quality MAT implementation increases participant uptake and appropriate
  medication use throughout court involvement'
