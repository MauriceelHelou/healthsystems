mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of prospective study designs limits ability to track severe asthma development over time'
- 'Step 2: Insufficient funding for longitudinal pediatric asthma cohorts'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare systems lack integrated data systems to track asthma progression'
- 'Step 4: Incidence rates cannot be determined without prospective data'
- 'Step 5: Prevention strategies remain underdeveloped due to knowledge gaps'

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism demonstrates how research funding priorities and healthcare data
    system organization affect knowledge generation about pediatric disease. Limited incidence data may
    perpetuate inequities by preventing targeted prevention efforts in high-risk populations. Equity implication:
    Without incidence data, interventions may not be appropriately targeted to communities with highest
    risk.'
