mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of symptom-triggered therapy (STT) protocol in emergency
  department clinical decision units provides structured assessment framework using
  Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol'
- 'Step 2: STT allows for individualized benzodiazepine dosing based on objective
  withdrawal severity measurements rather than fixed schedules'
- 'Step 3: Individualized dosing reduces unnecessary medication administration and
  waiting periods, accelerating patient stabilization'
- 'Step 4: Median time for STT completion of 12 hours enables discharge within 22-hour
  median CDU stay, reducing overall length of hospitalization'
