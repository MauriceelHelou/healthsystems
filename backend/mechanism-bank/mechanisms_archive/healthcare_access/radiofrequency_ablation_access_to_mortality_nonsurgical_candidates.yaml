direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare infrastructure determines availability of advanced ablation
  technologies (radiofrequency ablation) versus older injection techniques (percutaneous
  alcohol/acetic acid)'
- 'Step 2: Radiofrequency ablation provides more complete and reliable tumor destruction
  compared to chemical injection methods'
- 'Step 3: Differential access to technology-intensive treatments creates survival
  disparities among patients ineligible for surgery'
- 'Step 4: Resource allocation and facility capabilities structure which ablation
  modalities are available to non-surgical candidates'
