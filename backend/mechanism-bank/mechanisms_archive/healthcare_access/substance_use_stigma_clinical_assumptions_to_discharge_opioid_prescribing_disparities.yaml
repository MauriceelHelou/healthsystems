direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black patients with acute pancreatitis have higher documented rates of
  alcohol and tobacco use due to structural factors'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians making discharge decisions interpret substance use history as
  indicator of addiction risk rather than consequence of structural exposure'
- 'Step 3: Fear of contributing to opioid misuse or diversion leads to reduced opioid
  prescribing at discharge for Black patients despite similar pain scores'
- 'Step 4: Differential prescribing creates disparity in pain management access during
  recovery period, with White patients receiving discharge opioids more frequently
  (p=0.001)'

    patients used to justify reduced opioid prescribing despite being structural consequence
