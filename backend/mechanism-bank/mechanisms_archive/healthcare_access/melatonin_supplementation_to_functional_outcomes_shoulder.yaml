mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Melatonin supplementation improves sleep quality in early postoperative
  period (6 weeks)'
- 'Step 2: Improved sleep supports physiological healing processes including tissue
  repair, inflammation resolution, and pain modulation'
- 'Step 3: Better healing and pain control enable earlier and more effective rehabilitation
  participation'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced rehabilitation compliance leads to improved shoulder function
  measured by ASES scores at 4 and 6 months postoperatively'
