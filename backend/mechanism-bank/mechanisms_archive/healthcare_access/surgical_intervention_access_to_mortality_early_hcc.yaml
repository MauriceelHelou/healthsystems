direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Surgical eligibility creates a structural divide in treatment options available
  to patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma'
- 'Step 2: Surgery provides potential for complete tumor removal with curative intent
  in eligible patients'
- 'Step 3: Differential access to surgical versus non-surgical interventions creates
  disparate survival trajectories based on clinical eligibility criteria'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system infrastructure determines which patients are deemed surgically
  eligible, potentially creating structural barriers to optimal treatment'
