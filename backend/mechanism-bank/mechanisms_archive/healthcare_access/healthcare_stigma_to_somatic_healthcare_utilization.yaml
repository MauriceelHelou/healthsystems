direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OST patients anticipate and experience stigmatizing attitudes and discriminatory
  treatment from healthcare providers'
- 'Step 2: Fear of being treated badly and stigmatized creates psychological barriers
  to seeking care'
- 'Step 3: Patients deprioritize their health needs and avoid contact with conventional
  healthcare system'
- 'Step 4: Unmet healthcare needs accumulate, leading to decreased utilization of
  medically necessary somatic healthcare'
