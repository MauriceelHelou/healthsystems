- 'Step 1: General practice workflows are structured around time-constrained appointment
  systems and electronic health record processes'
- 'Step 2: Screening tools that do not align with existing workflows require additional
  steps, documentation, and time'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare professionals face competing demands and prioritize activities
  that fit seamlessly into established routines'
- 'Step 4: Poor workflow integration results in lower adoption and inconsistent implementation
  of screening protocols'
