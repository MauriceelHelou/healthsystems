  housing instability, unpredictable work schedules, caregiving responsibilities,
  and transportation limitations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced structural obstacles enable consistent medication access despite
  life circumstances that would disrupt fixed-site treatment'
- 'Step 4: Sustained access to MOUD promotes treatment continuity and retention over
  time'
