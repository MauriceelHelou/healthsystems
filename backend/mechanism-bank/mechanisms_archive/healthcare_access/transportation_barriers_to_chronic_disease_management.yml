mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of reliable transportation (no vehicle, limited transit) creates physical
  barrier to regular healthcare appointments'
- 'Step 2: Missed appointments disrupt continuity of chronic disease monitoring and
  medication management'
- 'Step 3: Gaps in care lead to uncontrolled biomarkers (HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids)
  and disease progression'
- 'Step 4: Poorly controlled chronic disease results in complications, hospitalizations,
  and emergency care needs'
- 'Step 5: Reliance on emergency care rather than primary care worsens long-term outcomes
  and costs'

description: Transportation barriers significantly impair chronic disease management
  through missed appointments and care discontinuity. A systematic review of 14 studies
  found that transportation assistance interventions (bus passes, taxi vouchers, rideshare)
  improve screening follow-up (OR 1.48-2.30), healthcare linkage (39% improvement),
  and chronic disease biomarkers. Low-income and functionally limited populations
  face the greatest transportation barriers.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: spatial_arrangement
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Transportation barriers are structurally determined by urban
    planning decisions, transit investment, healthcare facility siting, and vehicle
    ownership patterns that systematically disadvantage low-income communities and
    communities of color. Solutions require structural investments in transit, healthcare
    in underserved areas, and medical transportation programs rather than expecting
    individuals to overcome systemic barriers.
assumptions:
- Transportation barrier defined as delayed or missed care due to transportation
- Includes both lack of personal vehicle and inadequate public transit
- Chronic diseases include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer
  screening
limitations:
- Many studies lack control groups and use non-randomized designs
- Low uptake of transportation interventions in some studies (only 4% accepted bus
  passes in Taylor 1999)
- Difficult to isolate transportation from other access barriers
- Longitudinal follow-up of disease outcomes generally lacking
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Transportation barriers vary by urban form, transit infrastructure,
    and healthcare facility distribution. Rural areas face distance barriers; urban
    areas face transit quality issues.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Midwest and South regions show higher transportation barrier prevalence
  - Rural areas face greater distance-related barriers
  - Urban areas with robust transit show lower barriers
