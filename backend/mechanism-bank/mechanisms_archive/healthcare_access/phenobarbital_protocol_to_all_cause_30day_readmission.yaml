mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Phenobarbital-based protocol provides more effective stabilization of alcohol
  withdrawal symptoms during hospitalization'
- 'Step 2: Longer half-life of phenobarbital may provide extended protection against
  withdrawal symptoms after discharge'
- 'Step 3: More complete resolution of withdrawal syndrome reduces acute complications
  requiring readmission'
- 'Step 4: Improved clinical stability at discharge reduces risk of medical decompensation
  in the 30-day post-discharge period'
