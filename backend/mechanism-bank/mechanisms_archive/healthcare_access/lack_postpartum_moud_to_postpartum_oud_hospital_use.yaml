direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system fails to provide continuity of MOUD treatment during
  postpartum transition period'
- 'Step 2: Discontinuation or lack of MOUD leaves individuals with OUD without evidence-based
  pharmacotherapy to manage cravings and withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: Without MOUD, individuals face higher risk of relapse, overdose, and other
  OUD-related complications'
- 'Step 4: Increased complications result in emergency department visits, overdose
  events, and acute inpatient hospitalizations'
