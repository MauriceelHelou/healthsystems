mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized protocol provides clear clinical guidance for assessing need
  for inpatient versus outpatient management of alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 2: Evidence-based medication options (particularly gabapentin) are systematically
  prescribed for alcohol withdrawal treatment'
- 'Step 3: Appropriate risk stratification allows lower-risk patients to be safely
  managed in outpatient settings rather than requiring inpatient admission'
- 'Step 4: Reduced unnecessary hospital admissions while maintaining patient safety
  through proper assessment and treatment protocols'
