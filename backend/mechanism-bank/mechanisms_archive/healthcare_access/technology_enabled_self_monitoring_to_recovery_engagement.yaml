- 'Step 1: Purpose-built mobile health app developed through participatory design
  methods ensures user-centered functionality for people in recovery'
- 'Step 2: App provides accessible platform for routine outcome monitoring with 94%
  account creation rate and 88% initial use, lowering barriers to engagement'
- 'Step 3: Personal feedback screens (Urges screen and Overall Progress screen) become
  most frequently visited sections, indicating high user engagement with self-monitoring
  data'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement (58% using app >5 weeks) supports continued recovery
  participation despite typical challenges with mobile health app retention'
