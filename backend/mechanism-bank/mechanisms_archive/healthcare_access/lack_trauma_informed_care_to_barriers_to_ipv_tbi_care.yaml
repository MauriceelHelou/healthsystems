  node_name: Barriers to Care for IPV-TBI Survivors
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems lack trauma-informed practices that understand impact
  of violence and avoid re-traumatization'
- 'Step 2: Racist practices and structural inequities create differential access and
  quality of care for marginalized women'
- 'Step 3: Providers without adequate training fail to screen for IPV in culturally
  appropriate ways or recognize TBI symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Women survivors face multiple barriers including stigma, lack of trust,
  and inadequate services, preventing access to needed care'
