mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medically assisted detoxification involves acute withdrawal from alcohol
  with medical supervision'
- 'Step 2: Repeated cycles of alcohol withdrawal and detoxification may sensitize
  neurological pathways'
- 'Step 3: Neurological sensitization alters pain processing systems, leading to exacerbation
  of neuropathic pain symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Chronic neurological changes persist beyond the acute detoxification period,
  manifesting as ongoing neuropathic pain'
