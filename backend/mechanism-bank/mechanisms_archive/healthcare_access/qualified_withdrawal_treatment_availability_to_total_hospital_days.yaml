- 'Step 1: QWT reduces relapse rates through extended treatment and psychosocial support'
- 'Step 2: Lower relapse rates translate to fewer and less severe alcohol-related
  complications requiring hospitalization'
- 'Step 3: Reduced severity and frequency of hospitalizations decreases cumulative
  inpatient days'
- 'Step 4: Population-level hospital bed days decrease'
