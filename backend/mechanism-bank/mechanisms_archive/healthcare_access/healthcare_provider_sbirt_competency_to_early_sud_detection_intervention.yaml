category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Providers with enhanced SBIRT knowledge, confidence, and SUD understanding
  are more likely to routinely implement screening in primary care and mental health
  settings'
- 'Step 2: Systematic screening increases identification of at-risk substance use
  before progression to severe substance use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Brief interventions delivered at point of screening can reduce problematic
  substance use and prevent escalation'
- 'Step 4: Appropriate referrals to treatment connect identified individuals with
  specialized services when needed, enabling earlier entry into care continuum'
