  node_id: peripheral_neuropathy

direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oxaliplatin administered as part of colorectal cancer chemotherapy regimen
  (FOLFOX or XELOX) creates direct neurotoxic exposure to peripheral nerves'
- 'Step 2: Cumulative dosing over multiple treatment cycles leads to progressive neuronal
  damage and dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Peripheral nerve damage manifests as sensory and motor dysfunction including
  tingling, numbness, hypersensitivity, walking difficulties, and increased pain sensation'
- 'Step 4: Clinical and subclinical neuropathy develops in majority of patients, with
  66.6% showing neurological symptoms and/or electrophysiological signs after 4 cycles'
