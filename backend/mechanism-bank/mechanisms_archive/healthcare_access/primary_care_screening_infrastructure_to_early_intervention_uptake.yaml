direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universal screening in primary care identifies patients with less severe
  alcohol problems who would not typically seek specialty treatment'
- 'Step 2: Automated intervention system reduces threshold for receiving evidence-based
  intervention by eliminating need for clinician time allocation'
- 'Step 3: Patients with less severe problems receive brief intervention without adding
  to primary care burden or requiring specialty referral'
- 'Step 4: Early intervention occurs before progression to more severe alcohol use
  disorders requiring intensive treatment'
