mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hospitalization creates a ''captive'' healthcare encounter for patients
  who may not otherwise seek addiction treatment'
- 'Step 2: Medical admission provides an opportunity for comprehensive assessment
  and diagnosis of alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 3: Hospital setting allows for medically supervised withdrawal management
  and MAUD initiation'
- 'Step 4: Inpatient treatment initiation can serve as gateway to ongoing outpatient
  addiction care for patients with limited healthcare access'

    33.0% for inpatient, 1.9% to 41.4% at discharge)
