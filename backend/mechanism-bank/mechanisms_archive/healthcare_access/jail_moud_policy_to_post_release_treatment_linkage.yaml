- 'Step 1: Jails with MOUD programs develop relationships with community methadone
  clinics and addiction treatment providers'
- 'Step 2: These partnerships facilitate communication and care coordination between
  correctional and community healthcare systems'

  and ensuring medication continuity'
- 'Step 4: Released persons have improved connection to MOUD resources in the community,
  reducing treatment disruption'
