- 'Step 1: Nursing home closure eliminates local provider of both PAC and LTC services'
- 'Step 2: Alternative providers (home health agencies, swing bed hospitals) may not
  offer comprehensive service range'
- 'Step 3: Distance barriers increase even when accounting for all alternative provider
  types'
- 'Step 4: Residents face reduced access to full continuum of post-acute and long-term
  care'
