mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized screening protocols systematically prompt healthcare providers
  to ask all patients about intimate partner violence exposure'
- 'Step 2: Universal screening removes reliance on provider discretion or clinical
  suspicion alone, reducing missed cases'
- 'Step 3: Validated screening instruments provide structured questions that increase
  patient disclosure of abuse'
- 'Step 4: Significantly more IPV victims are detected compared to non-standardized
  identification approaches'

    significantly increases victim identification, though it is unclear if one specific
