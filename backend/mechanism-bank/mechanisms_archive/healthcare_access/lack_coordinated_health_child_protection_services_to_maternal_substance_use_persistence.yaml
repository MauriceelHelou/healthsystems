direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fragmented service delivery systems fail to identify and address maternal
  substance use during critical prenatal and early life periods'
- 'Step 2: Lack of integration between alcohol and drug treatment, antenatal care,
  and postnatal services creates gaps in continuous care'
- 'Step 3: Mothers face barriers to accessing coordinated support that addresses both
  substance use and parenting needs'
- 'Step 4: Substance use continues into early child life period, increasing maltreatment
  risk and child protection involvement'
