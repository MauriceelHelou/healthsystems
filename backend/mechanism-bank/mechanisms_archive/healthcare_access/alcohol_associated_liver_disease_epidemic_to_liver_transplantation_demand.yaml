direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-associated liver disease has become the leading cause of liver
  pathology in Europe and the United States'
- 'Step 2: Disease progression in untreated or inadequately treated patients leads
  to end-stage liver disease requiring transplantation evaluation'
- 'Step 3: Increasing prevalence of alcohol-associated liver disease directly increases
  the pool of patients requiring liver transplantation'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare systems face increased demand for transplantation services and
  organ allocation resources'
