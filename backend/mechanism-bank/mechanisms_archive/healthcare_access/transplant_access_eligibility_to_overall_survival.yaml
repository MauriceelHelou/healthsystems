mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Liver transplantation offers potential cure for hepatocellular carcinoma
  by removing tumor and underlying diseased liver'
- 'Step 2: Access to transplantation determined by selection criteria that stratify
  risk of post-transplant recurrence'
- 'Step 3: Patients meeting eligibility criteria receive transplantation with risk-stratified
  outcomes (low-risk: 9.5% recurrence, acceptable-risk: 20.5%, high-risk: 40.5%)'
- 'Step 4: Overall survival is secondary outcome improved by transplant access when
  appropriate risk stratification occurs'
