mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Caregivers with poor perception of child''s health may indicate underlying unaddressed medical
  complexity'
- 'Step 2: Poor perceived health status reflects inadequate disease management or unresolved health issues'
- 'Step 3: Unresolved health problems increase vulnerability to acute health deterioration'
- 'Step 4: Increased vulnerability leads to higher likelihood of emergency department visits and hospital
  readmissions'

  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural healthcare gaps where caregivers recognize unmet
    health needs that the healthcare system has not adequately addressed, indicating systemic failures
    in comprehensive care delivery rather than individual caregiver failings
