mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systematic screening of eligible primary care patients increases identification
  of individuals with hazardous or harmful alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Early detection occurs before progression to severe alcohol use disorder
  or alcohol-related medical complications'
- 'Step 3: Screen-positive individuals become eligible for brief interventions proven
  effective in reducing alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Population-level screening creates opportunities for prevention and early
  intervention at scale'
