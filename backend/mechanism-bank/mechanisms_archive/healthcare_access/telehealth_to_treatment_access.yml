- 'Step 2: Flexible scheduling accommodates work and childcare obligations that conflict with clinic hours'
- 'Step 3: Reduced wait times and immediate access options enable same-day treatment initiation'
- 'Step 4: Lower barrier to entry increases treatment engagement for stigmatized conditions'
- 'Step 5: Improved access and convenience leads to better treatment retention and outcomes'

description: Virtual/telehealth care delivery significantly improves treatment access and retention. Alberta's
  Virtual Opioid Dependency Program demonstrated rapid growth, 90% 6-month retention, and 58% 12-month
  retention. Same-day start reduced median wait from 6 days to 0 days. Virtual care is particularly effective
  for behavioral health, chronic disease management, and populations facing geographic or stigma barriers.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: institutional
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Telehealth can reduce geographic and transportation barriers but may create new
    digital divide disparities. Implementation must address broadband access, device availability, and
    digital literacy to avoid excluding low-income and elderly populations. Policy should ensure telehealth
    reimbursement parity and audio-only options for those without video capability.
assumptions:
- Telehealth includes video visits, phone consultations, and asynchronous messaging
- Treatment access measured by initiation rates, wait times, and retention
- Assumes adequate technology infrastructure and reimbursement policies
limitations:
- Some conditions require in-person examination or procedures
- Digital divide may exclude vulnerable populations
- Long-term outcomes data still emerging for many conditions
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Telehealth impact varies based on broadband infrastructure, state licensing laws, and
    baseline access barriers.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas show largest access improvements from telehealth
  - States with telehealth parity laws show higher utilization
  - Areas with limited specialty care benefit most from virtual specialty access
