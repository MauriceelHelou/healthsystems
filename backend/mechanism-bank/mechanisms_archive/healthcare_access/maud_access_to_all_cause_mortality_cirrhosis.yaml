mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MAUD (naltrexone or acamprosate) prescribed to patients with alcohol-associated
  cirrhosis and high-risk alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Medications achieve and maintain abstinence or reduced alcohol consumption
  in patients with AUD'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption prevents progression of liver disease and cirrhosis
  decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of cirrhosis progression and decompensation reduces mortality
  risk'
