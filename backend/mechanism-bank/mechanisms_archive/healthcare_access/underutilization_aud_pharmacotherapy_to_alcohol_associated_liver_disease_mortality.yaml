category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Efficacious pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder exist but
  are seldomly prescribed to patients who need them'
- 'Step 2: Lack of prescription and access to evidence-based treatments results in
  continued unhealthy alcohol use in patients with existing liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol consumption in patients with alcohol-associated liver
  disease accelerates disease progression and hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Untreated alcohol use disorder leads to increased rates of liver transplantation
  need and liver-related deaths'
