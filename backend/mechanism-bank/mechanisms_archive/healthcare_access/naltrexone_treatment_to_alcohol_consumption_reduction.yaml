mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Naltrexone antagonizes opioid receptors involved in alcohol reward pathways'
- 'Step 2: Blockade of mu-opioid receptors reduces euphoric effects of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Diminished reward response decreases motivation to engage in heavy drinking
  episodes'
- 'Step 4: Reduced heavy drinking days contribute to improved alcohol use disorder
