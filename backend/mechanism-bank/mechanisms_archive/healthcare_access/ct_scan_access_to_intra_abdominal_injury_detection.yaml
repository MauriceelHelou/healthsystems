direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CT scanning provides high diagnostic accuracy for identifying intra-abdominal
  injuries in blunt trauma patients'
- 'Step 2: Normal CT scan at admission effectively rules out clinically significant
  intra-abdominal pathology in hemodynamically stable patients'
- 'Step 3: High negative predictive value (99.8%) allows for safe discharge without
  prolonged observation, preventing unnecessary hospital resource utilization'
