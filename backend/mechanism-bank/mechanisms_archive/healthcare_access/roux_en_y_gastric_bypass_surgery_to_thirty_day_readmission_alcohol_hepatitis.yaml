direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: RYGB patients present with more severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (higher
  MELD-Na scores)'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate post-discharge resources and monitoring fail to address unique
  needs of post-bariatric surgery patients with liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Altered metabolism and disease severity lead to complications requiring
  hospital readmission'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system lacks targeted interventions for this high-risk population
  at discharge'
