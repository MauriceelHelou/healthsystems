direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transplant programs implement restrictive listing criteria including mandatory
  abstinence periods specifically for ALD patients'
- 'Step 2: Restrictive criteria exclude patients who might derive clinical benefit
  from transplantation but cannot meet behavioral requirements'
- 'Step 3: Exclusion disproportionately affects patients with limited access to addiction
  treatment, mental health services, and social support'
- 'Step 4: Patients who die before meeting listing criteria or during abstinence requirement
  period are never evaluated in transplant outcome data, creating survival bias'
