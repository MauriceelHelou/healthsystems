mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universal SBIRT screening includes validated alcohol use assessment tools
  administered to all primary care patients regardless of presenting complaint'
- 'Step 2: Systematic screening detects hazardous and harmful alcohol use patterns
  that may not be volunteered by patients or identified through standard medical history'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention protocols provide clinical documentation framework specifically
  for alcohol-related concerns'
- 'Step 4: Increased provider awareness and documentation leads to formal DSM-IV alcohol
  abuse or dependence diagnosis on Medicaid claims'
