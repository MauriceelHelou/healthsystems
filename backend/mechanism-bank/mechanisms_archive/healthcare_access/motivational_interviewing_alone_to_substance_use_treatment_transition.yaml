mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Motivational interviewing session enhances individual readiness and motivation
  for behavior change following detoxification'
- 'Step 2: Increased motivation may improve intention to engage in substance use treatment'
- 'Step 3: However, without navigation support, structural barriers (transportation,
  insurance, appointment access) remain unaddressed'
- 'Step 4: Motivational interviewing alone may be less resource-intensive but not
  optimally effective without practical barrier removal'
