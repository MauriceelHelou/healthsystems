direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standard DUI programs designed without gender-specific considerations fail
  to address differential needs and trauma histories'
- 'Step 2: Women presenting with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and domestic
  violence history receive treatment focused primarily on alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Unaddressed mental health comorbidities and trauma undermine treatment
  effectiveness and recovery'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate treatment of root causes (trauma, mental health) perpetuates
  cycle of alcohol use and recidivism'
