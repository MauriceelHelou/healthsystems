- 'Step 1: Access to medications (likely pharmacotherapy for AUD such as naltrexone,
  acamprosate, or disulfiram) reduces physiological cravings and withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Medications modify neurobiological reward pathways and reduce reinforcing

  in behavioral and social recovery interventions'
