mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SSL implementation strategy provides didactic training to trauma center
  staff on validated AOD screening tools and protocols'
- 'Step 2: Performance feedback mechanisms enable trauma centers to monitor and adjust
  screening practices in real-time through EHR data'
- 'Step 3: Facilitation support helps trauma centers integrate screening workflows
  into routine adolescent trauma admission processes'
- 'Step 4: Systematic implementation across organizational levels creates structural
  capacity for consistent screening delivery to admitted adolescent trauma patients'
