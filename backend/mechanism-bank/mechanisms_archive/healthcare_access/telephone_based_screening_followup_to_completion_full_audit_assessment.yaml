- 'Step 1: Telephone outreach eliminates transportation barriers and time constraints
  that prevent patients from returning to clinic for follow-up assessment'
- 'Step 2: Remote access increases reach to working patients and those with caregiving
  responsibilities who cannot attend in-person appointments'
- 'Step 3: Trained counselors successfully contact patients at convenient times, facilitating
  completion of comprehensive alcohol use assessment'
- 'Step 4: 412 of 632 patients (65.2%) who screened positive completed full AUDIT
  via telephone, enabling risk stratification for appropriate intervention'
