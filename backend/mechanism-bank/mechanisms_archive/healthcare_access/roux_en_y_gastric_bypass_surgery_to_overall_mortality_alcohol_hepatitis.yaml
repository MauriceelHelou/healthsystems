direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: RYGB alters gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology, affecting alcohol
  metabolism and absorption patterns'
- 'Step 2: Post-RYGB patients develop more severe alcohol-associated hepatitis as
  evidenced by higher MELD-Na scores (15.1 vs 10.9)'
- 'Step 3: Increased disease severity and altered metabolism lead to accelerated liver
  damage progression'
- 'Step 4: Higher disease burden results in increased overall mortality after discharge
  from hospital'
