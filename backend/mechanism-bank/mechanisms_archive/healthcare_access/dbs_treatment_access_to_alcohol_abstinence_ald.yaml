mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Deep brain stimulation provides neurosurgical intervention targeting brain
  circuits involved in alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: DBS modulates neural pathways associated with addiction and craving reduction'
- 'Step 3: Successful DBS treatment results in sustained abstinence from alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Abstinence from alcohol prevents further liver damage and allows for liver
  function stabilization or improvement'

  description: DBS cost-effectiveness increases substantially for advanced ALD patients
    (fibrosis stage 3 or beyond) compared to general AUD patients, with cost-effectiveness
    achieved at 53% success rate for advanced ALD versus no cost-effectiveness for
    general AUD at any success rate

  description: For advanced decompensated ALD patients, DBS becomes cost-effective
    at even lower success rates (35% over one year) compared to compensated advanced
    ALD (53% over two years)

  description: Higher DBS success rates improve cost-effectiveness, with threshold
    analysis showing minimum success rates of 35-53% needed for cost-effectiveness
    depending on disease severity
