direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low SES individuals experience accumulated health disadvantages including
  higher baseline disease burden and delayed care-seeking'
- 'Step 2: Telephone triage systems less frequently direct low SES callers to face-to-face
  medical contact despite medical need'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to timely face-to-face evaluation delays diagnosis and treatment
  of serious conditions'
- 'Step 4: Delayed or missed interventions for acute conditions lead to disease progression
  and increased mortality risk'
- 'Step 5: Low SES callers experience higher 30-day mortality following telephone
  triage contact'
