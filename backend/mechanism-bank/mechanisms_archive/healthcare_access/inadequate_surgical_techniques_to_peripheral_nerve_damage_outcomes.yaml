direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current surgical approaches and autograft procedures represent the clinical
  standard but have inherent limitations in replicating natural nerve architecture'
- 'Step 2: These conventional methods fail to adequately restore nerve number, myelin
  thickness, and axon characteristics needed for full functional recovery'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate regeneration leads to persistent peripheral neuropathy symptoms
  including pain and functional deficits'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience considerable decline in quality of life due to incomplete
  nerve restoration'
