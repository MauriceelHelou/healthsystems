- 'Step 1: Robust implementation infrastructure provides organizational resources,
  workflows, and support systems needed to operationalize systematic screening protocols'
- 'Step 2: Infrastructure enables integration of screening tools into electronic health
  record systems and clinical workflows'
- 'Step 3: Adequate infrastructure ensures clinician training, decision support, and
  capacity to conduct systematic screening during primary care visits'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced organizational capacity reduces barriers to delivering universal
  screening across patient populations'
