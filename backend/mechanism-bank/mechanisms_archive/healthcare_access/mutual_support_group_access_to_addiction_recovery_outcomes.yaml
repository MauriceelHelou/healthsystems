- 'Step 1: Trained facilitators provide structured mutual support group sessions using
  Self-Management and Recovery Training methodology'
- 'Step 2: Group participation enables peer support, shared recovery experiences,
  and collective self-management strategies'
- 'Step 3: Routine outcome monitoring through mHealth app (Smart Track) provides feedback
  to participants on recovery progress'
- 'Step 4: Tailored feedback and systematic tracking improve engagement with recovery
  processes and self-efficacy'
- 'Step 5: Sustained participation in structured mutual support leads to improved
  alcohol/drug use outcomes, mental health, and self-reported recovery'
