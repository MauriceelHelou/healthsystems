direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems implement alcohol screening but fail to integrate brief
  intervention protocols into clinical workflows'
- 'Step 2: Pregnant persons who screen positive for current alcohol use (approximately
  80% screened but only 16% receive intervention) do not receive counseling or support'
- 'Step 3: Without intervention, knowledge of alcohol use by provider does not translate
  to behavior change support for pregnant person'
- 'Step 4: Preventable alcohol-related adverse outcomes including birth defects and
  developmental disabilities may occur'
