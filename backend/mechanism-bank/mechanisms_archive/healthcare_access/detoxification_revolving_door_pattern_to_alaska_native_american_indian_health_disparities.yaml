direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Detoxification clinics manage acute intoxication and withdrawal but patients
  are discharged without adequate transition support to ongoing treatment'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers prevent successful transition to alcohol treatment,
  creating repeated cycles of discharge and readmission'
- 'Step 3: Alaska Native and American Indian populations experience disproportionate
  exposure to this revolving door pattern due to systemic barriers'
- 'Step 4: Chronic cycling through detoxification without sustained treatment perpetuates
  substance use disorders and associated health inequities'
