mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentin and baclofen combination provides effective symptom management
  for mild AWS without respiratory depression risk of benzodiazepines'
- 'Step 2: Effective alternative treatment reduces need for escalation to benzodiazepines
  and associated intensive monitoring requirements'
- 'Step 3: Lower escalation rates reduce transfers to higher levels of care (ICU or
  specialized units), maintaining patients in general acute care settings'
