direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: X-waiver authorization allows clinicians to legally prescribe buprenorphine
  in office-based settings'
- 'Step 2: Increased number of waivered clinicians expands geographic availability
  of evidence-based medication treatment'
- 'Step 3: Office-based treatment reduces barriers compared to specialty opioid treatment
  programs (reduced stigma, integrated care)'
- 'Step 4: However, only 36% of waivered clinicians actually prescribe, limiting realized
  impact on treatment access'
