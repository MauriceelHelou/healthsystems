- 'Step 1: Symptom-triggered approach administers medication only when withdrawal
  symptoms meet protocol thresholds'
- 'Step 2: Conservative dosing prevents prolonged sedation and medication accumulation'
- 'Step 3: Patients transition off protocol more efficiently when symptoms resolve
  without unnecessary medication'
- 'Step 4: Median protocol duration of 44.9 hours (IQR 22.4-77.2) indicates relatively
  brief treatment course'
