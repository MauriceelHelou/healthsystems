direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Occupational health services provide universal access to screening across
  socioeconomic and ethnic groups, removing traditional barriers to alcohol intervention
  services'
- 'Step 2: Electronic screening identifies hazardous drinkers (25% of participants)
  who would not typically seek help for their drinking'
- 'Step 3: Personalized feedback increases awareness and motivation to change drinking
  behavior (13% reported motivation to change)'
- 'Step 4: Follow-up at three months (64% completion rate) provides accountability
  and sustained engagement with behavior change'
