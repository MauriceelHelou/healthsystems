direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol use disorder diagnosis face stigma and discrimination
  in healthcare settings'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers may withhold or delay HCV treatment referrals based
  on misconceptions about alcohol use and treatment eligibility'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers in healthcare systems (e.g., insurance requirements,
  provider gatekeeping) disproportionately affect patients with substance use disorder
  diagnoses'
- 'Step 4: Patients with alcohol use disorder encounter reduced access to DAA treatment
  despite clinical guidelines recommending treatment regardless of alcohol use'
