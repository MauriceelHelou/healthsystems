- 'Step 1: Limited mental health service availability in rural and remote areas constrains
  service options for youth populations'
- 'Step 2: Distance and availability challenges create structural barriers to preferred
  face-to-face consultation access'
- 'Step 3: Reduced availability necessitates reliance on alternative delivery methods
  (telehealth) or foregone care'
- 'Step 4: Overall mental health service utilization patterns shaped by availability
  constraints rather than optimal care preferences'
