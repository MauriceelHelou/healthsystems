- 'Step 1: Robotic surgical technology enables minimally invasive liver transplant
  procedures with enhanced precision and dexterity'
- 'Step 2: Minimally invasive approach reduces surgical trauma, blood loss, and tissue
  disruption compared to open surgery'
- 'Step 3: Reduced surgical trauma accelerates post-operative recovery and mobilization'
- 'Step 4: Faster recovery enables earlier hospital discharge and reduced length of
  stay'
