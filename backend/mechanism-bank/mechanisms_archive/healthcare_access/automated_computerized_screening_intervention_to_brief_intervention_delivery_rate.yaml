mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Automated computerized relational agent eliminates reliance on busy primary
  care staff to deliver brief interventions'
- 'Step 2: System standardizes screening and intervention delivery without adding
  burden to clinical workflows'
- 'Step 3: Automated system ensures consistent delivery of brief interventions to
  all patients with positive screens'
- 'Step 4: Increased rate of brief intervention delivery occurs without requiring
  additional clinician time or resources'
