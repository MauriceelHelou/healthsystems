mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community-based MOUD access connects previously disengaged individuals
  to formal healthcare system for first time'
- 'Step 2: Improved care coordination and case management identifies previously unaddressed
  medical conditions requiring inpatient treatment'
- 'Step 3: Stabilization on MOUD enables individuals to tolerate and access needed
  hospital-based care they previously avoided'
- 'Step 4: Increased hospital utilization reflects appropriate care-seeking rather
  than emergency crisis management'
