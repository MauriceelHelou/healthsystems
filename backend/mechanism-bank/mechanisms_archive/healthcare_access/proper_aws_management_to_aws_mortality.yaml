- 'Step 1: Implementation of evidence-based AWS management protocols including validated
  assessment tools (CIWA-Ar) enables systematic monitoring of withdrawal severity'
- 'Step 2: Protocol-driven care ensures appropriate pharmacotherapy selection and
  dosing based on withdrawal severity and progression'
- 'Step 3: Systematic management prevents life-threatening complications including
  severe delirium tremens, autonomic instability, and withdrawal seizures'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of severe complications directly reduces mortality in the 5-10%
  of patients who would otherwise develop serious medical problems'
