category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Locating outpatient clinics in the largest communities and in decentralized
  patterns reduces average travel time for populations across the service area'
- 'Step 2: Reduced travel distances overcome the distance decay effect that creates
  barriers to outpatient mental health service utilization'
- 'Step 3: Placing services closer to where people live ensures remote areas are not
  insufficiently supplied with mental health care'
- 'Step 4: Improved geographic distribution of services creates more equitable access
  patterns across rural and urban populations'
