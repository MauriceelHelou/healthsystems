- 'Step 2: Missed primary care leads to unmanaged chronic conditions and delayed
  care for acute symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Conditions progress to severity requiring emergency intervention'
- 'Step 4: Emergency department becomes default care access point (ambulances available
  regardless of transportation)'
- 'Step 5: Cyclical pattern develops as ED care does not establish ongoing care relationships'

  interpretation: Individuals with 4+ annual ED visits have 9 times higher prevalence
    of transportation barriers than those with no ED visits (11.9% vs 1.3%), indicating
    transportation barriers drive ED-dependent care patterns

description: Transportation barriers are strongly associated with emergency department
  utilization patterns. Those with 4+ annual ED visits are 9 times more likely to
  report transportation barriers compared to those with no ED visits. This reflects
  a structural pattern where lack of transportation prevents primary care access but
  emergency care remains accessible via ambulance, creating costly and suboptimal
  care patterns.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: healthcare_system_design
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: ED-dependent care patterns resulting from transportation barriers
    reflect healthcare system design that provides emergency access universally while
    primary care access depends on individual transportation resources. This creates
    inequitable care patterns that are more costly and less effective. Structural
    solutions include community health centers, mobile health units, and medical transportation
    programs.
assumptions:
- ED utilization measured as annual visit frequency
- Transportation barriers self-reported in NHIS
- Association is bidirectional (barriers cause ED use; chronic conditions causing
  ED use also cause barriers)
limitations:
- Cross-sectional data limits causal inference
- Self-reported transportation barriers may underestimate true prevalence
- Does not distinguish appropriate from inappropriate ED use
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: ED utilization patterns vary by primary care availability, transit
    infrastructure, and ambulance response patterns.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas with limited primary care may show higher ED-dependent patterns
  - Urban areas with accessible hospitals but poor transit show similar patterns
