  node_name: Jail MOUD Availability
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural counties experience higher and increasing rates of opioid-related
  deaths compared to urban counties'
- 'Step 2: Rural areas have fewer healthcare providers, addiction specialists, and
  treatment facilities per capita'
- 'Step 3: Rural jails reflect community-wide healthcare infrastructure deficits and
  lack specialized addiction treatment resources'
- 'Step 4: Despite greater need based on opioid death rates, rural jails are significantly
  less likely to offer MOUD, creating treatment-need mismatch'
