mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinical decision units in emergency departments provide short-stay observation
  and treatment capacity for conditions traditionally requiring inpatient admission'
- 'Step 2: Availability of CDU beds with nursing staff trained in symptom-triggered
  therapy enables management of alcohol withdrawal in ED setting'
- 'Step 3: Structured STT protocol allows safe discharge after median 22 hours when
  withdrawal symptoms stabilized'
- 'Step 4: Only 3% of patients required escalation to general hospital admission,
  avoiding inpatient placement for 97% of alcohol withdrawal cases'
