direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SAP block provides regional anesthesia alternative to systemic opioid analgesia
  for rib fracture pain'
- 'Step 2: Effective nerve blockade reduces baseline pain intensity requiring less
  supplemental opioid medication'
- 'Step 3: Patients receiving SAP block require median 0 morphine milligram equivalents
  (MME) compared to 20 MME in standard therapy group'
- 'Step 4: Reduced opioid consumption decreases risk of opioid-related adverse effects
  and dependency'
