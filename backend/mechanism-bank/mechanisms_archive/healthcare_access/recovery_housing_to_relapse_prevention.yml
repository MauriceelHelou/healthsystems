mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recovery housing (sober living homes) provides substance-free living environment removing alcohol
  access and use triggers'
- 'Step 2: Peer accountability through house rules, drug testing, and community expectations supports
  abstinence'
- 'Step 3: Stable housing addresses fundamental need while individual develops coping skills and rebuilds
  life in recovery'
- 'Step 4: Peer support from housemates provides 24/7 encouragement, modeling, and early relapse intervention'
- 'Step 5: Extended residence (6-12 months) during vulnerable early recovery period dramatically reduces
  relapse and supports transition to independent living'

  equity_implications: 'Recovery housing is evidence-based but systematically inaccessible to those who
    need it most. NIMBY zoning restricts recovery housing in many communities, concentrating homes in
    disinvested neighborhoods. Most recovery housing is private-pay ($500-$2,000/month), excluding low-income
    individuals. Medicaid doesn''t cover room and board, creating access barriers. Quality is unregulated
    in most states, allowing exploitation. Criminal records from addiction create housing barriers compounding
    need. The recovery housing access gradient reflects policy choices about: zoning exclusion vs. inclusion,
    Medicaid coverage of recovery supports, housing quality regulation, and whether stable housing is
    recognized as addiction treatment infrastructure. Limited access particularly harms individuals experiencing
    homelessness, criminal justice involvement, and poverty—populations with greatest relapse risk. Addressing
    this requires: zoning reform protecting recovery housing, Medicaid demonstration projects covering
    housing, quality certification standards, public funding for affordable recovery housing, and challenging
    housing discrimination.'
assumptions:
- Recovery housing refers to peer-run, voluntary, substance-free communal living
- Residents maintain abstinence and participate in mutual support/treatment
- Mechanism operates through environmental control, peer support, and stability
limitations:
- Quality and structure of recovery housing varies enormously; unregulated sector has quality concerns
- Individual readiness and motivation affect outcomes; housing alone insufficient without engagement
- Limited research on optimal models, length of stay, and populations served
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Recovery housing availability and regulation varies dramatically by state policies
    and local zoning
  relevant_geographies:
  - States with certification standards (e.g., Florida, Massachusetts) have more regulated quality
  - NIMBY zoning in affluent communities restricts recovery housing, concentrating in disinvested areas
  - Urban areas have more recovery housing options than rural areas
  - Some states fund affordable recovery housing through criminal justice or treatment systems
