- 'Step 1: Limited investment in IPV support services and alcohol treatment infrastructure
  creates resource scarcity'
- 'Step 2: Geographic or economic inaccessibility of services prevents survivors from

  learned helplessness'
- 'Step 4: Survivors anticipate futility of help-seeking and cease attempts to access
  support'
