  providing clear medication guidance to prescribers'
- 'Step 2: Gabapentin offers effective alcohol withdrawal symptom management with
  potentially lower abuse potential than benzodiazepines'

  in outpatient settings rather than requiring inpatient monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Expanded outpatient treatment capacity increases access to withdrawal management
  services'
