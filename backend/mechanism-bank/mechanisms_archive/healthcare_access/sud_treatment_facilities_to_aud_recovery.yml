mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher treatment facility density reduces geographic barriers and travel time to access addiction
  services'
- 'Step 2: Greater facility availability enables timely treatment entry when individual motivation is
  high, capturing critical windows'
- 'Step 3: Multiple facility options allow individuals to find treatment philosophies and approaches matching
  their preferences'
- 'Step 4: Facility density enables step-down continuum of care from residential to intensive outpatient
  to outpatient maintenance'
- 'Step 5: Accessible ongoing treatment and recovery support services facilitate sustained remission and
  reduce AUD prevalence'

description: Higher substance use disorder treatment facility density improves alcohol use disorder recovery
  outcomes by reducing access barriers, enabling timely treatment entry, providing treatment options,
  and supporting continuum of care.

  equity_implications: 'Treatment facility distribution is not market-driven but reflects policy and investment
    decisions that create treatment deserts. Rural areas and low-income communities have severe facility
    shortages while affluent areas have abundant private treatment options. Federal and state funding
    for community addiction treatment has been decimated while private luxury rehabs serve those with
    resources. Facility deserts concentrate in communities of color experiencing highest addiction burden
    from structural inequities. Geographic access barriers compound insurance and stigma barriers. The
    facility density-recovery gradient reflects policy choices about public treatment investment, facility
    licensing, zoning for recovery housing, and Medicaid reimbursement rates. High untreated AUD in treatment
    deserts represents structural abandonment. Addressing this requires: massive public investment in
    community treatment infrastructure, loan forgiveness for addiction providers serving underserved areas,
    Medicaid rate increases, and zoning reform for treatment facilities and recovery housing.'
assumptions:
- Facility density measured as facilities per capita within geographic area (county/region)
- Assumes facilities offer outpatient, intensive outpatient, and/or residential services
- Access requires both geographic proximity and financial affordability
limitations:
- Facility density alone insufficient; quality, capacity, and insurance acceptance matter
- Individual barriers (stigma, motivation, co-occurring disorders) affect utilization
- Telehealth may reduce importance of physical facility density for some services
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Treatment facility density varies dramatically, creating treatment deserts in rural
    areas and underserved communities
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas have severe facility shortages, often <1 facility per 100,000 population
  - Urban areas have higher facility density but deserts exist in low-income neighborhoods
  - States with robust public treatment systems (e.g., Oregon) show better geographic coverage
  - Affluent suburbs have disproportionate facility density serving private-pay clientele
