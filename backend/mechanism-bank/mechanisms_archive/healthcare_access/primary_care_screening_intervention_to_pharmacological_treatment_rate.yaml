direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systematic screening identifies patients with alcohol problems who may
  benefit from pharmacological treatment'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare professional training includes clear treatment directives for
  different levels of alcohol problems'
- 'Step 3: Primary care setting enables direct prescribing of alcohol medications
  (Disulfiram, Naltrexone, Acamprosate, Nalmefene)'
- 'Step 4: Early identification allows intervention before problems escalate to requiring
  specialized care'
- 'Step 5: Increased prescribing rates reflect expanded access to evidence-based pharmacological
  interventions'
