direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insufficient staffing levels at SerD (outpatient addiction centers) reduce
  capacity to provide comprehensive services'
- 'Step 2: Limited staff availability restricts the number of patients who can receive
  HCV screening, referral, and treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Practitioners are unable to follow protocol recommendations due to time
  and resource constraints'
- 'Step 4: Less than 50% of PWID patients receive appropriate HCV care despite availability
  of effective medications and universal health care'

  description: Practitioners who follow protocol recommendations are able to deliver
    all four services (screening, referral, treatment, harm reduction) to >50% of
    patients, suggesting that adherence to protocols can partially mitigate understaffing
    barriers
