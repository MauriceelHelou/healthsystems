  node_name: Service Utilization and Recovery Outcomes
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater spatial proximity of substance use treatment and mutual aid services
  in socially deprived communities reduces geographic barriers to access'
- 'Step 2: Reduced travel distance and time may lower transportation costs and logistical
  barriers for individuals seeking services'
- 'Step 3: However, availability does not guarantee accessibility—individuals in socially
  deprived areas face other structural barriers including lack of motor vehicle access,
  inflexible work schedules, childcare responsibilities, and stigma'
- 'Step 4: The net effect on actual service utilization and recovery outcomes remains
  uncertain and requires investigation of the relationship between availability, access,
  and individual client outcomes'
