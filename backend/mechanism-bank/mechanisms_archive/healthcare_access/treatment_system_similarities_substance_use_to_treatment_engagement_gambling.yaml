direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Treatment systems for addiction are primarily designed based on substance
  use disorder models'
- 'Step 2: People with gambling disorders encounter barriers largely similar to those
  with substance use disorders but also experience specific unique barriers'
- 'Step 3: Generic addiction treatment approaches fail to address gambling disorder-specific
  needs and barriers'
- 'Step 4: Mismatch between treatment design and patient needs reduces treatment engagement
  and effectiveness'
- 'Step 5: Poor treatment engagement perpetuates untreated gambling disorders and
  associated negative outcomes'
