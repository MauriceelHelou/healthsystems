direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system implements mandatory alcohol screening protocols across
  all adult primary care settings'
- 'Step 2: Screening is conducted during routine primary care visits, embedded in
  standard workflow rather than requiring patient self-referral'
- 'Step 3: Universal screening approach identifies patients with unhealthy alcohol
  use who would otherwise go undetected, including those with hypertension and type
  2 diabetes'
- 'Step 4: Positive screens trigger standardized pathways to brief intervention and
  treatment referral'
