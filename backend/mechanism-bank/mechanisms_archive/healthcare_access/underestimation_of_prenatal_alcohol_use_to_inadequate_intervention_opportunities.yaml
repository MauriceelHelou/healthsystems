mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Questionnaire-based screening underestimates actual prevalence of prenatal
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers fail to identify at-risk pregnancies requiring intervention
  and support'
- 'Step 3: Women continue alcohol consumption without receiving cessation counseling
  or harm reduction services'
- 'Step 4: Missed opportunities for early intervention increase cumulative fetal alcohol
  exposure and associated developmental risks'
