  node_id: mat_provider_shortage
  node_name: Limited Access to MAT Prescribers
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural areas have lower population density and reduced healthcare workforce,
  limiting number of providers offering specialized services like MAT'
- 'Step 2: Federal regulatory requirements (DATA 2000 waivers) restrict which providers
  can prescribe buprenorphine, further limiting rural capacity'
- 'Step 3: Limited number of MAT prescribers in rural areas face capacity constraints,
  creating waitlists and forcing patients to travel long distances'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers compound to create median travel distance of 48.8 miles
  to actual MAT prescribers despite closer geographic proximity to potential prescribers'
