- 'Step 1: Early transplantation policies eliminate mandatory sobriety waiting periods
  for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis'
- 'Step 2: Patients receive timely access to transplantation based on disease severity
  rather than arbitrary time requirements'
- 'Step 3: Transplantation occurs before disease progression to irreversible organ
  failure or death'
- 'Step 4: Overall favorable long-term outcomes are achieved even without enforced
  abstinence periods'
