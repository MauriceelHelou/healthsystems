mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nalmefene acts as an opioid antagonist similar to naltrexone, blocking
  endogenous opioid reward pathways'
- 'Step 2: Opioid receptor blockade reduces the pleasurable and reinforcing effects
  of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Diminished reinforcement leads to decreased motivation for heavy drinking
  episodes'
- 'Step 4: Consistent medication availability and use results in reduced frequency
  and intensity of heavy drinking'
