- 'Step 1: Cost-effectiveness analysis provides evidence for insurance coverage decisions
  and healthcare resource allocation'
- 'Step 2: Demonstration of cost-effectiveness at $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold
  supports coverage approval for interventions'
- 'Step 3: Insurance coverage and healthcare system adoption increase accessibility
  of effective treatments'
- 'Step 4: Greater treatment accessibility for advanced ALD patients improves population-level
  health outcomes through increased abstinence rates'

  description: Different willingness-to-pay thresholds across healthcare systems and
    payers determine whether treatments are deemed cost-effective and therefore accessible
