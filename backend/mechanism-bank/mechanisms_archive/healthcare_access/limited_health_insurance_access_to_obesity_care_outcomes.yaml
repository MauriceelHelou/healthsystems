  and public health insurance across racial groups'
- 'Step 2: Limited health insurance coverage creates financial barriers to accessing
  preventive care and obesity treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to healthcare services limits opportunities for early intervention,
  weight management programs, and treatment of obesity-related comorbidities'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate healthcare access contributes to worse obesity outcomes and
  higher mortality risk'
