direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medicolegal death investigation systems operate independently from healthcare
  electronic health record systems, creating data silos'
- 'Step 2: SUDORS definitions rely on limited data sources (scene investigation, next-of-kin
  interviews) that systematically miss housing status documented in clinical encounters'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare billing codes, address data, and clinical notes contain rich
  housing status information that remains inaccessible to public health surveillance'
- 'Step 4: Fragmented data systems produce artificially low estimates of housing instability
  prevalence (10.5% vs true 41.5%), distorting burden estimates'
