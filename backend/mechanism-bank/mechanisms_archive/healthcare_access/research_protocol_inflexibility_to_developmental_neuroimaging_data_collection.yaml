direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional neuroimaging research protocols require in-person assessments
  in specialized facilities with MRI equipment and trained staff'
- 'Step 2: Pandemic safety concerns, facility closures, and travel restrictions create
  barriers to accessing research sites for neuroimaging and neurocognitive testing'
- 'Step 3: Rigid protocol requirements without adaptive alternatives (remote assessments,
  mobile units) result in missed data collection windows during critical developmental
  periods in adolescence and young adulthood'
- 'Step 4: Loss of longitudinal data points compromises ability to characterize alcohol
  effects on brain development trajectories and neurocognitive outcomes across developmental
  stages'
