mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Benzodiazepines are used as standard treatment for alcohol withdrawal despite
  clear evidence base'
- 'Step 2: Benzodiazepines produce multiple adverse effects including blunting of
  cognition, interactions with depressant drugs, and disrupted sleep patterns'
- 'Step 3: Additional risks include abuse liability, craving, delirium, and dementia'
- 'Step 4: These adverse effects create barriers to safe withdrawal completion and
  ongoing treatment engagement'
