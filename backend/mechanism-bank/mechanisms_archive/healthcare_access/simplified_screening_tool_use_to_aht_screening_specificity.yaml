direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Analysis revealed one predictor variable in 4-variable tool lowered specificity
  without improving sensitivity'
- 'Step 2: Elimination of non-contributory variable from clinical decision rule reduces
  false positive rate'
- 'Step 3: Simplified 3-variable tool maintains high sensitivity while substantially
  increasing specificity from 29% to 84%'
- 'Step 4: Improved specificity reduces unnecessary investigations and interventions
  for families while maintaining case detection'
