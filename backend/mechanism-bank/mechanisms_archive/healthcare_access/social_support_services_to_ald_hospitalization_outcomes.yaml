mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare institution implements systematic screening by care coordinators
  for all ALD patients'
- 'Step 2: Care coordinators identify needs for rehabilitation counseling and post-discharge
  coordination'
- 'Step 3: Provision of social support services addresses structural barriers to recovery
  (housing, transportation, healthcare access)'
- 'Step 4: Equal access to support services mitigates the impact of neighborhood-level
  social vulnerability on clinical outcomes'
- 'Step 5: Hepatic decompensation, critical care needs, readmission, and mortality
  show no significant difference by SVI'
