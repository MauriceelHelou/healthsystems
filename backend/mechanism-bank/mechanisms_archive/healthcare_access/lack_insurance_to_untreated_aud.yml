mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of insurance creates financial barrier to accessing addiction treatment which is expensive
  ($5,000-$30,000 for residential programs)'
- 'Step 2: Uninsured individuals avoid screening and early intervention in primary care due to cost concerns'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to medications for alcohol use disorder (naltrexone, acamprosate) which require
  prescriber visits and pharmacy costs'
- 'Step 4: Delayed treatment seeking results in progression to severe AUD with medical complications requiring
  expensive acute care'
- 'Step 5: Cycling through emergency departments and hospitals for complications without receiving underlying
  addiction treatment perpetuates untreated AUD'

  equity_implications: 'Tying healthcare access to employment and ability to pay is a deliberate policy
    choice, not natural law. The US is unique among wealthy nations in allowing insurance status to determine
    addiction treatment access. Uninsured rates concentrate in states refusing Medicaid expansion, disproportionately
    harming low-income communities of color. The insurance-treatment gap reflects political decisions
    to prioritize private insurance industry profits over universal health coverage. Mental Health Parity
    laws exist but are poorly enforced, allowing insurers to deny addiction care. High untreated AUD among
    uninsured populations represents policy violence—predictable suffering from refusal to guarantee healthcare
    as right. Addressing this requires: Medicare for All, Medicaid expansion in all states, robust parity
    enforcement, and challenging profit-driven healthcare that treats addiction care as discretionary
    rather than essential.'
assumptions:
- Assumes market-rate treatment costs prohibitive for uninsured low-income individuals
- Limited safety-net capacity cannot meet need from uninsured population
- Insurance status assessed as primary coverage, not episodic emergency Medicaid
limitations:
- Some uninsured individuals access treatment through sliding-scale clinics or mutual aid
- Even insured face barriers from inadequate coverage and prior authorization denials
- Treatment access encompasses more than insurance (geographic access, cultural competence matter)
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Uninsured rates and treatment access vary dramatically by state Medicaid policies and
    safety-net capacity
  relevant_geographies:
  - Medicaid expansion states show 40-50% lower uninsured rates and higher treatment utilization
  - Texas and Florida have highest uninsured populations and large treatment access gaps
  - Rural areas lack addiction treatment facilities regardless of insurance status
  - Urban areas with FQHCs and public hospitals provide more safety-net treatment options
