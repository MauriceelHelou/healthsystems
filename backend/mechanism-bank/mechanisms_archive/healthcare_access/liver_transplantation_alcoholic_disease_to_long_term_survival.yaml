- 'Step 1: Patients with alcoholic liver disease receive liver transplantation, replacing
  failed organ with functioning liver'
- 'Step 2: Transplantation reverses end-stage liver disease and prevents death from
  liver failure'
- 'Step 3: Post-transplant care and immunosuppression maintain graft function'
- 'Step 4: Very good long-term survival outcomes are achieved despite unique health
  concerns including malignancy and metabolic complications'
