direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater drug dependence severity increases the complexity and intensity
  of healthcare needs for both substance use and co-occurring mental health conditions'
- 'Step 2: More severe dependence may trigger greater stigma and discrimination from
  healthcare providers, creating barriers to accessing appropriate care'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers including service capacity constraints, long waitlists,
  and limited availability of specialized substance use treatment programs disproportionately
  affect those with more severe dependence'
- 'Step 4: The combination of increased need, stigma-based barriers, and structural
  service limitations results in higher rates of unmet healthcare needs among those
  with more severe drug dependence'
