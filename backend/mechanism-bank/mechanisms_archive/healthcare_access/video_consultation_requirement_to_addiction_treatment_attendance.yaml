direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Video consultations require access to technology (smartphone, computer,
  reliable internet) that may be unavailable to patients with substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Digital divide and technical barriers disproportionately affect socioeconomically
  disadvantaged populations common in addiction treatment populations'
- 'Step 3: Technical difficulties or unfamiliarity with video platforms creates additional
  access barriers beyond those of face-to-face visits'
- 'Step 4: Reduced attendance limits treatment engagement and continuity of care'
