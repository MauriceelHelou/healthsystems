mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability reduces access to routine cardiovascular care and specialist visits'
- 'Step 2: Delayed or missed preventive and management care leads to later-stage disease presentation'
- 'Step 3: Complex procedures require stable housing for pre-operative preparation and post-operative
  recovery'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare providers may defer elective procedures for patients without stable housing due
  to recovery concerns'

description: Veterans experiencing homelessness and unstable housing had lower rates of receiving certain
  cardiovascular procedures including coronary artery bypass graft, lower extremity revascularization,
  and carotid artery stenosis interventions.

  description: Complex procedures requiring post-operative care (coronary artery bypass graft, lower extremity
    revascularization, carotid artery stenosis interventions) show stronger associations with housing
    status
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how housing instability creates barriers to life-saving
    cardiovascular interventions. The pattern reflects structural inequities where housing policy failures
    translate directly into differential access to advanced medical procedures, potentially contributing
    to worse cardiovascular outcomes among vulnerable populations.
