mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare institutions establish standardized medication dosing protocols
  for alcohol withdrawal management in emergency department settings'
- 'Step 2: Protocols that incorporate phenobarbital enable provision of higher total
  medication doses (measured in lorazepam equivalents) compared to benzodiazepine-only
  protocols'
- 'Step 3: Higher medication doses provide more effective suppression of withdrawal
  symptoms through enhanced GABA-ergic neurotransmission'
- 'Step 4: Improved symptom control reduces physiological distress and stabilizes
  patients more completely before discharge'
