  node_name: AOD Service Accessibility for Indigenous Australians
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Organizational structures and policies within AOD services create procedural
  and systemic barriers for Indigenous Australians'
- 'Step 2: Inflexible appointment systems, intake processes, waiting lists, and service
  requirements misaligned with Indigenous community needs and realities limit initial
  access'
- 'Step 3: Geographic concentration of services in urban areas (as evidenced by NSW
  research concentration) creates distance barriers for Indigenous peoples in regional
  and remote areas'
- 'Step 4: Reduced accessibility results in delayed or foregone treatment, perpetuating
  substance use and associated health harms'
