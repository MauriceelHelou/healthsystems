mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Symptom-triggered therapy protocols replace fixed-schedule dosing approaches
  in alcohol withdrawal management'
- 'Step 2: Assessment-driven medication administration aligns benzodiazepine dosing
  with objective clinical need rather than predetermined schedules'
- 'Step 3: Dynamic dosing approach reduces both medication overexposure and undertreatment
  of withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Improved safety profile with reduced complications while using lower total
  medication doses'
