mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Robotic surgical platform provides enhanced visualization, precision, and
  minimally invasive access compared to open surgery'
- 'Step 2: Improved surgical precision reduces intraoperative tissue trauma, bleeding,
  and bile duct injury risk'
- 'Step 3: Minimally invasive approach decreases wound-related complications, infection
  risk, and surgical stress response'
- 'Step 4: Reduced surgical trauma and complications improve early post-transplant
  recovery trajectory'
