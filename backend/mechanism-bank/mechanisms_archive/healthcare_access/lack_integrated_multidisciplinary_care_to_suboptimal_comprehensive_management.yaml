direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems fail to implement integrated care models that combine
  hepatology and addiction medicine expertise'
- 'Step 2: Fragmented care structures separate treatment of liver disease from treatment
  of underlying alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 3: Patients receive incomplete management addressing only liver disease without
  adequate addiction treatment or vice versa'
- 'Step 4: Suboptimal comprehensive management results in poor long-term outcomes
  as abstinence from alcohol is not achieved alongside liver disease treatment'
