mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Finasteride inhibits 5-alpha reductase enzyme, reducing conversion of testosterone
  to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced DHT levels alter neurosteroid synthesis in the brain, affecting
  GABA-A receptor modulation'
- 'Step 3: Changes in neurosteroid levels and neurotransmitter systems disrupt mood
  regulation pathways'
- 'Step 4: Dysregulation of anxiety-related neurotransmitter systems increases risk
  of clinical anxiety disorders'
