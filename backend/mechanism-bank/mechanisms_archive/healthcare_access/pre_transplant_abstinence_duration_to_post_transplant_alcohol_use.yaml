mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Longer pre-transplant abstinence period allows for physiological stabilization
  and potential neurobiological recovery from alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 2: Extended abstinence provides opportunity for engagement with addiction
  treatment services and development of relapse prevention skills'
- 'Step 3: Structural requirement of >6 months abstinence serves as both selection
  criterion and therapeutic intervention period'
- 'Step 4: Greater abstinence duration prior to transplant reduces likelihood of return
  to any alcohol use following transplantation'
