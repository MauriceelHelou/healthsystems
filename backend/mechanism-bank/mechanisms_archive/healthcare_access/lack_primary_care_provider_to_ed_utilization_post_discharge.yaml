  continuous medical support for post-discharge complications and questions'
- 'Step 2: Without primary care access, survivors lack appropriate venue for non-emergency
  follow-up care and medication management'

  settings escalate or remain unresolved'
- 'Step 4: Survivors default to emergency department as only accessible point of care
  for post-discharge medical needs'
