direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medicaid expansion increases insurance coverage more rapidly among criminal
  justice-involved populations who had higher baseline uninsurance rates'
- 'Step 2: Expanded coverage provides criminal justice-referred individuals with similar
  insurance status to non-criminal justice populations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced financial barriers allow some criminal justice-referred individuals
  to access MOUD at rates closer to other populations'
- 'Step 4: The gap in treatment receipt between criminal justice-referred and other
  referral sources narrows, though does not close completely'
