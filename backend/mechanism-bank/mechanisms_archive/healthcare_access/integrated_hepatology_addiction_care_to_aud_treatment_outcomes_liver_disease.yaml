mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated care models build strong structural relationships between addiction
  professionals and hepatologists/liver disease providers'
- 'Step 2: Strong referral systems and care coordination reduce barriers to accessing
  specialized addiction treatment for liver disease patients'
- 'Step 3: Co-management allows optimization of both liver disease treatment and AUD
  treatment simultaneously, addressing medical complexity'
- 'Step 4: Improved care coordination increases treatment engagement, reduces loss
  to follow-up, and enables comprehensive disease management'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced treatment engagement and comprehensive care improve both addiction
  recovery outcomes and liver disease outcomes'
