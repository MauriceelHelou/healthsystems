direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated trauma systems incorporate pediatric readiness standards across
  all levels of care from prehospital through definitive treatment'
- 'Step 2: System-wide pediatric readiness ensures training, staffing, education,
  and equipment availability at all trauma center designation levels'
- 'Step 3: Coordinated pediatric protocols across the trauma continuum improve handoffs,
  reduce treatment delays, and ensure appropriate care at each stage'
- 'Step 4: Comprehensive system integration reduces gaps in pediatric trauma care,
  improving overall morbidity and mortality outcomes for injured children'
