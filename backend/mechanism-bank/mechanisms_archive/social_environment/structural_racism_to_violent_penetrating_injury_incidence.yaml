category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical and contemporary policies (redlining, discriminatory lending,
  disinvestment) concentrate communities of color in resource-poor neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: These neighborhoods experience higher unemployment, poverty, limited educational
  opportunities, and reduced access to violence prevention resources'
- 'Step 3: Economic marginalization and social disorganization create conditions for
  interpersonal violence'
- 'Step 4: Young Black men disproportionately experience violent penetrating injuries
  as both perpetrators and victims within structurally disadvantaged contexts'
