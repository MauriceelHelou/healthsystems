direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness limits access to food storage, preparation facilities, and
  cooking equipment'
- 'Step 2: Food choices become constrained to shelf-stable, processed, or fast food
  options available through emergency food systems'
- 'Step 3: Financial constraints and lack of transportation reduce access to grocery
  stores with fresh, nutritious foods'
- 'Step 4: Resulting dietary pattern shows lower diet quality as measured by healthy
  eating indices'
