mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Household composition challenges limit capacity for health management and environmental control'
- 'Step 2: Disability status increases vulnerability to respiratory exposures and reduces mobility to
  avoid hazards'
- 'Step 3: Complex household needs compete with respiratory health priorities for limited resources'
- 'Step 4: Social isolation and caregiving burdens delay healthcare seeking for respiratory symptoms'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how household structure and disability interact with
    broader social systems to create health vulnerabilities. It recognizes how structural barriers limit
    options for vulnerable households rather than blaming household composition itself, focusing on systemic
    supports needed for complex households and disabled individuals.
