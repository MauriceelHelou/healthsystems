description: Housing instability, as measured in the Western 9 psychosocial screening tool, contributes
  to increased hospital readmission risk through multiple pathways affecting care continuity and health
  management
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces housing instability to health outcomes through systemic barriers
    in healthcare delivery and social support systems rather than individual failures
