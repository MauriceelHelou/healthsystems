mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol dependence is hypothesized to promote disinhibition and impaired
  decision-making in individuals with psychopathic traits'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol use creates situational contexts that increase risk for sexual
  and violent offending behaviors'
- 'Step 3: However, in this population of incarcerated sex offenders in treatment,
  MAST scores did not significantly predict recidivism outcomes within 5 years'

  description: MAST scores did not significantly contribute to recidivism prediction
    in this sample of offenders undergoing treatment, suggesting treatment participation
    may attenuate the alcohol-recidivism relationship found in other studies
