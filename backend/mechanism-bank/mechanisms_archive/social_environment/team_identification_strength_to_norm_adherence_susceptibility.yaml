mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students develop varying levels of psychological identification with their
  club sport team over time'
- 'Step 2: Stronger team identification increases the salience and importance of team-related
  social norms'
- 'Step 3: Higher identification amplifies conformity pressures and motivation to
  align behavior with group standards'
- 'Step 4: At timepoints with stronger identification, students become more susceptible
  to perceived team drinking norms'
- 'Step 5: This dynamic susceptibility leads to increased adherence to both descriptive
  and injunctive drinking norms'
