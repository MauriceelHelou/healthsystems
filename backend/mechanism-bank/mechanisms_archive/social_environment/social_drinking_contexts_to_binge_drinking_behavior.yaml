- 'Step 1: Campus and community environments provide spaces where alcohol consumption
  is normalized (parties, bars, social gatherings)'
- 'Step 2: Peer presence in these contexts creates social norms and expectations around
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Availability of these contexts provides regular opportunities for binge
  drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: Sustained pattern of binge drinking behavior develops and is maintained
  through repeated environmental exposure'
