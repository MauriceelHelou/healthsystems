direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to violence and trauma (including intimate partner violence, sexual
  assault, child abuse, political and community violence, criminal violence, structural
  violence) creates psychological distress and disrupts emotional regulation capacities'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to trauma-informed mental health services, particularly
  for marginalized populations, leaves trauma unaddressed'
- 'Step 3: Individuals develop maladaptive coping mechanisms including substance use
  to manage trauma symptoms and emotional dysregulation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic substance use develops into substance use disorder requiring clinical
  treatment'
