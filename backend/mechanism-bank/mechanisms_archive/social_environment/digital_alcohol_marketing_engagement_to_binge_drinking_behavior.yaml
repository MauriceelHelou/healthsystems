direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social media alcohol marketing often portrays high-intensity drinking occasions
  and party contexts, normalizing excessive consumption patterns'
- 'Step 2: User engagement with alcohol content on social media (liking, sharing)
  creates social identity associations with drinking culture and heavy drinking contexts'
- 'Step 3: Digital engagement amplifies exposure to peer drinking content through
  algorithmic feeds and social network effects, creating perceived norms that heavy
  drinking is common and acceptable'
- 'Step 4: These reinforced social norms and identities associated with drinking culture
  lead to adoption of binge drinking patterns, particularly among youth'
