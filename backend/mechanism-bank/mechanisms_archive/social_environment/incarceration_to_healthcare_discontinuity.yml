- 'Step 1: Incarceration removes individuals from community-based healthcare relationships
  and insurance coverage'
- 'Step 2: Prison healthcare is often inadequate and not integrated with community
  systems'
- 'Step 3: Upon release, immediate gaps occur as Medicaid enrollment takes weeks
  and employment-based insurance requires job acquisition'
- 'Step 4: Criminal record creates employment discrimination, limiting access to
  employer-sponsored insurance'
- 'Step 5: Housing instability post-release further disrupts care continuity and
  medication access'

    description: Medicaid enrollment typically delayed weeks to months post-release;
      many states terminate rather than suspend during incarceration
  sample_size: 12686
  interpretation: Incarceration creates healthcare discontinuity manifesting as 30%
    higher ED use and 23% higher hospitalization for chronic disease, plus 3.5-fold
    elevated mortality risk in first two weeks post-release

description: Incarceration creates healthcare discontinuity through multiple structural
  mechanisms including insurance termination, disruption of provider relationships,
  inadequate prison healthcare, and post-release barriers to care. This manifests
  as elevated ED utilization (IRR 1.30), hospitalization (IRR 1.23), and dramatically
  elevated mortality risk in the weeks following release (RR 3.5 in first two weeks).
  Systemic solutions require Medicaid continuity, discharge planning, and reentry
  healthcare linkage.

  equity_implications: Healthcare discontinuity from incarceration disproportionately
    affects Black and low-income communities due to mass incarceration patterns rooted
    in systemic racism. The healthcare system and criminal legal system are not coordinated,
    creating preventable gaps in care. Solutions require Medicaid continuity policies,
    institutional discharge planning, and healthcare system coordination with reentry
    services.
assumptions:
- Healthcare discontinuity includes insurance gaps, provider disruption, and medication
  access
- Incarceration includes jail and prison stays of varying duration
- Post-release period is highest risk for healthcare-related adverse outcomes
limitations:
- Selection effects (factors leading to incarceration also affect health)
- Data on incarceration history often self-reported and underestimated
- Prison healthcare quality varies substantially across facilities
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Healthcare discontinuity varies by state Medicaid policy, prison
    healthcare quality, and availability of reentry services.
  relevant_geographies:
  - States with Medicaid expansion provide better post-release coverage
  - States with suspension (vs. termination) policies enable faster coverage
  - Counties with strong reentry programs show better continuity
