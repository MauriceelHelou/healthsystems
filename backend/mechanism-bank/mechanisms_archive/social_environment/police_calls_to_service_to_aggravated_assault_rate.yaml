mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher police calls to service indicate elevated levels of neighborhood
  disorder, conflict, and underlying social instability'
- 'Step 2: Police presence and activity may reflect or exacerbate community tensions
  and adversarial relationships between residents and authorities'
- 'Step 3: Neighborhoods with frequent police calls experience heightened surveillance
  and enforcement that can increase stress and conflict without addressing root causes'
- 'Step 4: The combination of underlying disorder, police presence without violence
  abatement, and community stress contributes to elevated aggravated assault rates'
