direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young sport consumers are exposed to alcohol brands through sponsorship
  of sporting events, teams, and athletes'
- 'Step 2: Positive image attributes from the sponsored sporting event (e.g., excitement,
  success, athleticism) transfer to the sponsoring alcohol brand through repeated
  association'
- 'Step 3: Consumers develop perception of implied endorsement, assuming teams/athletes
  favor the sponsor brand by virtue of the sponsorship relationship'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced brand image and perceived endorsement increase positive attitudes
  toward alcohol brands and normalize alcohol consumption in sport contexts'
- 'Step 5: Increased positive brand attitudes and normalization lead to increased
  hazardous alcohol consumption patterns among young sport consumers'
