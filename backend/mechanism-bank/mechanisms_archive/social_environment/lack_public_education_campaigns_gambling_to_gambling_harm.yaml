direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of public health campaigns normalizes sports betting as a harmless
  recreational activity rather than a risk behavior'
- 'Step 2: Young men lack awareness of gambling risks, harms, and warning signs comparable
  to education about drugs and alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Without risk awareness, young men continue engaging in sports betting without
  recognizing developing harmful patterns'
- 'Step 4: Gambling behaviors escalate without early intervention or self-recognition
  of problematic use'
