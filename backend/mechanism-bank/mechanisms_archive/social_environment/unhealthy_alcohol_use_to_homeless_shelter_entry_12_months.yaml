mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unhealthy alcohol use often reflects broader structural stressors including
  poverty, unemployment, trauma exposure, and lack of mental health services'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol use intersects with discriminatory housing policies and landlord
  screening practices that create barriers to housing retention'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to integrated addiction treatment and housing support services
  in healthcare systems fails to prevent housing loss'
- 'Step 4: Structural shortage of affordable housing and inadequate social safety
  nets increase vulnerability to homelessness among those with alcohol problems'

  description: After adjusting for past shelter use, AUDIT scores no longer significantly
    predicted future shelter entry, indicating housing history reflects deeper structural
    vulnerabilities than current alcohol use severity
