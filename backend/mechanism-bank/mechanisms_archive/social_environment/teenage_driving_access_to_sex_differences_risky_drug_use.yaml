direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Driving access differentially affects mobility patterns and social network
  access by sex due to gender-stratified peer networks and supervision norms'
- 'Step 2: Female teenagers may experience different changes in spatial access to
  drug markets and substance-using peer groups compared to males when gaining driving
  independence'
- 'Step 3: Gender-specific social contexts and peer dynamics shape how increased mobility
  translates into drug use opportunities and overdose risk'
- 'Step 4: Sex differences in drug overdose mortality emerge as structural result
  of how transportation access interacts with gendered social environments'
