category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus SRV prevention programs fail to include LGBTQ+ students in curriculum,
  materials, and outreach despite evidence of elevated risk'
- 'Step 2: LGBTQ+ students lack access to culturally relevant prevention education
  and protective resources tailored to their relationship dynamics and experiences'
- 'Step 3: Absence of LGBTQ+-affirming prevention creates knowledge gaps about consent,
  healthy relationships, and help-seeking in LGBTQ+ contexts'
- 'Step 4: LGBTQ+ students remain vulnerable to SRV without institutional support
  structures that recognize and address their specific risk factors'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of SRV victimization persist among LGBTQ+ college students
  compared to heterosexual/cisgender peers'
