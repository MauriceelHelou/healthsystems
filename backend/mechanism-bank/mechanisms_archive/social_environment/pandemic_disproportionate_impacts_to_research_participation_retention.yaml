direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates disproportionate health, economic, and social
  burdens on communities typically underrepresented in research (racial/ethnic minorities,
  low-income populations)'
- 'Step 2: These disproportionate impacts include higher disease burden, job loss,
  caregiving demands, technology access barriers, and transportation challenges'
- 'Step 3: Increased stressors and barriers reduce capacity and resources available
  for research participation among already underrepresented groups'
- 'Step 4: Without targeted retention efforts, longitudinal developmental neuroimaging
  studies lose diverse participants, compromising study validity and health equity
  insights'
