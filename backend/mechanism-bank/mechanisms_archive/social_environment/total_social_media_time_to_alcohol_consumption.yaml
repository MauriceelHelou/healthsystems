direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative exposure to multiple social media platforms during the transition
  to college increases overall visibility of peer social activities involving alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure across platforms amplifies perceptions of how frequently
  and how much same-sex peers drink'
- 'Step 3: Elevated perceived drinking norms become internalized as standard college
  behavior'
- 'Step 4: Students increase their own alcohol consumption to align with inflated
  perceptions of peer behavior'

  description: Total daily social media time predicted alcohol consumption among men
    but not women. This sex-specific pattern suggests differential susceptibility
    to social media influence on drinking norms and behaviors.
