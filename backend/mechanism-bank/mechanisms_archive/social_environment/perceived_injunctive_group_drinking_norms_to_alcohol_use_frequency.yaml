direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students form perceptions about what their peer group approves of or considers
  acceptable regarding alcohol consumption (injunctive norms)'
- 'Step 2: These injunctive norms (perceived group approval) are positively associated
  with individual drinking at the between-person level, showing stable associations
  across individuals'
- 'Step 3: Within-person analysis reveals strong contemporaneous associations between
  perceived approval norms and drinking frequency at each timepoint'
- 'Step 4: Prospective within-person associations demonstrate that changes in perceived
  injunctive norms predict future changes in alcohol use frequency, providing evidence
  for conformity mechanisms'
- 'Step 5: Students adjust their drinking behavior over time to align with what they
  perceive their peer group approves of, demonstrating social conformity processes'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Injunctive norms (approval-based) demonstrate prospective conformity
    effects while descriptive norms (behavior-based) do not, suggesting approval norms
    are more influential for future behavior change
- name: social_group_cohesion
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Club sport teams represent cohesive social groups where approval and
    acceptance may be particularly important, potentially strengthening conformity
    to injunctive norms
- name: temporal_lag
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Three-month lag between measurements allows for detection of prospective
    conformity effects as students adjust behavior to align with perceived group approval
    over time
