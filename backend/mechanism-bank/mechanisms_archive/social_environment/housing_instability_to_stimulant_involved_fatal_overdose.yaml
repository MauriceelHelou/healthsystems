direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates chronic stress, environmental chaos, and reduced
  access to stable healthcare relationships'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing reduces ability to maintain harm reduction supplies,
  safe consumption spaces, and medication storage'
- 'Step 3: Housing instability increases exposure to drug market violence and contaminated
  drug supply through reliance on survival networks'
- 'Step 4: Unstable housing reduces likelihood of emergency response when overdose
  occurs due to consumption in isolated or unsafe locations'
- 'Step 5: Healthcare systems systematically underdetect housing instability, preventing
  targeted interventions and increasing overdose mortality risk'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Linking surveillance data to EHR increased detected housing instability
    from 10.5% to 41.5%, revealing a nearly 4-fold undercount in standard surveillance
    systems. This suggests the true association is much stronger than traditional
    surveillance suggests.
- name: safety_net_healthcare_utilization
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Individuals with stimulant-involved overdoses who accessed safety-net
    hospitals had higher detected rates of housing instability, indicating that healthcare
    system contact patterns moderate detection and potentially intervention opportunities
- name: surveillance_data_source
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Reliance on SUDORS definitions alone dramatically undercounted housing
    instability (10.5% vs 41.5%), weakening observed associations in standard public
    health surveillance and preventing appropriate resource allocation
