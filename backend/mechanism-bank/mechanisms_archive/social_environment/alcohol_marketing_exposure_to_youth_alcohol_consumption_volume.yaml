  node_name: Youth Alcohol Consumption Volume
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Among youth who already consume alcohol, marketing exposure reinforces
  drinking behavior and creates brand loyalty through repeated exposure to promotional
  messages'
- 'Step 2: Marketing portrays heavier drinking patterns and promotes consumption occasions,
  increasing perceived norms around frequency and quantity of drinking'
- 'Step 3: Brand-specific marketing creates preferences for particular alcohol products
  and encourages trial of new brands and product types'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative marketing effects lead to increased frequency of drinking occasions
  and higher volumes consumed per occasion among current youth drinkers'
