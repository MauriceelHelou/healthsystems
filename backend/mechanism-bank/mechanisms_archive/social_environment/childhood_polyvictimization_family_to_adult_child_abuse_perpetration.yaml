direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple types of victimization within the family environment create adverse
  developmental conditions during childhood'
- 'Step 2: Polyvictimization disrupts normative socialization processes and models
  violence as an acceptable family interaction pattern'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative trauma from multiple victimization types impairs emotion regulation,
  parenting skills, and stress management capacities'
- 'Step 4: These developmental impacts create vulnerability to perpetrating abuse
  when assuming parenting roles in adulthood, perpetuating intergenerational transmission
  of violence'
