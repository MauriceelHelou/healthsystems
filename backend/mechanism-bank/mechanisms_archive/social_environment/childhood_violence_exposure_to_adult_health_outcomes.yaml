- 'Step 1: Violence against children (physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect)
  creates adverse childhood experiences that disrupt normal developmental processes'
- 'Step 2: These traumatic exposures become embedded through biological, psychological,
  and social pathways across the life course'
- 'Step 3: Retrospective measurement of these childhood exposures allows identification
  of long-term health effects in adulthood'
- 'Step 4: Valid and reliable measurement instruments are essential for establishing
  the magnitude and nature of these long-term effects on adult physical and mental
  health outcomes'
