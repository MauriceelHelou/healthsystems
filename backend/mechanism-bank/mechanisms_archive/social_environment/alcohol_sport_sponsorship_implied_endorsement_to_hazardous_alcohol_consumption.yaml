direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sponsorship relationships create perceived connections between respected
  athletes/teams and alcohol brands in consumer consciousness'
- 'Step 2: Consumers interpret sponsorship as implied endorsement, assuming that athletes
  and teams favor or approve of the sponsoring alcohol brand'
- 'Step 3: Implied endorsement leverages the trust, admiration, and parasocial relationships
  consumers have with sports figures to enhance alcohol brand credibility'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced brand credibility and perceived athlete approval normalize alcohol
  consumption and reduce perceived risks associated with hazardous drinking'
- 'Step 5: Normalization and reduced risk perception lead to increased alcohol consumption
  among sport consumers who trust their athletic role models'
