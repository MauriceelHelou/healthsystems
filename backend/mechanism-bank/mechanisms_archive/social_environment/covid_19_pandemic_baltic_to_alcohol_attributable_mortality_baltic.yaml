  node_name: 100% Alcohol-Attributable Mortality in Baltic Countries
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Baltic countries enter COVID-19 pandemic with higher baseline alcohol consumption
  levels compared to other European countries'
- 'Step 2: Pandemic crisis conditions (lockdowns, economic disruption, healthcare
  service interruptions) disproportionately affect populations with existing heavy
  drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Larger pool of heavy drinkers in Baltic countries experience intensified
  drinking during crisis due to stress, isolation, and reduced access to treatment
  services'
- 'Step 4: Higher concentration of severe alcohol use disorder in population leads
  to substantially elevated rates of fully attributable deaths (alcoholic liver disease,
  alcohol poisoning, etc.)'
