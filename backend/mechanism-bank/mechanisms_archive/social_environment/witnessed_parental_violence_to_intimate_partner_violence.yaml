direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood exposure to father-to-mother violence normalizes violence as
  a conflict resolution strategy and relationship pattern'
- 'Step 2: Intergenerational transmission occurs through learned behavioral scripts
  and trauma-related neurobiological changes affecting stress response systems'
- 'Step 3: Witnessing parental violence shapes expectations about partner relationships
  and may reduce recognition of warning signs or ability to exit violent relationships'
- 'Step 4: Childhood trauma exposure increases vulnerability to revictimization through
  altered threat perception, attachment patterns, and reduced access to protective
  resources'

  description: The combination of childhood violence exposure and current partner
    alcohol use may compound risk through multiple pathways, as alcohol use strongly
    predicts IPV (aOR=3.81) and may interact with intergenerational transmission patterns.
