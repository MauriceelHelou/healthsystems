  node_name: Implicit Attitudes Toward Alcohol
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incidental exposure to alcohol brand advertising during dynamic sporting
  events creates repeated visual contact with brand imagery'
- 'Step 2: Mere exposure effect occurs through passive processing of advertising stimuli
  embedded in sports content'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive associations between alcohol brand and positive sports context
  strengthen through implicit learning mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Implicit attitudes toward the advertised brand become more positive, even
  controlling for baseline alcohol usage patterns'
- 'Step 5: Positive implicit attitudes generalize from specific brand to alcohol in
  general'

    associations may enhance the implicit attitude formation process
