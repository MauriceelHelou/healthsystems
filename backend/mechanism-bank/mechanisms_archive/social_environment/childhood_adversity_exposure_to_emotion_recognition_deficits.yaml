mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood adversities (including caregiver abuse, maternal psychopathology,
  family instability, financial stress, neighborhood disadvantage) were hypothesized
  to disrupt social-emotional development'
- 'Step 2: Repeated or chronic exposure to adversity from birth to age 8 was expected
  to impair the development of emotion recognition skills'
- 'Step 3: However, in this population-based sample, no association was found between
  any form of adversity exposure and emotion recognition deficits as measured by DANVA
  at age 8.5 years'
- 'Step 4: Results suggest possible immutability of emotion recognition skills in
  general population samples, contrasting with findings from clinical and high-risk
  samples'
