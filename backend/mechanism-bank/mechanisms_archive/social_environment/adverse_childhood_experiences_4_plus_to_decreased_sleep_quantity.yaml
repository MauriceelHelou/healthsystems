direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood adversity (abuse, neglect, family dysfunction) creates lasting
  neurobiological and psychological vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 2: COVID-19 lockdown restrictions create environmental stressors including
  social isolation, economic uncertainty, and disrupted routines'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with ACE histories have reduced capacity to regulate stress
  responses and adapt to environmental disruptions'
- 'Step 4: Stress dysregulation manifests as disrupted sleep patterns and reduced
  sleep quantity'
