direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol availability and consumption during weekend and nighttime
  hours creates temporal clustering of intoxicated individuals in social settings'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol intoxication impairs judgment, increases aggression, and reduces
  conflict resolution capacity in social interactions'
- 'Step 3: Violent confrontations occur with higher frequency during these periods,
  leading to acute injuries requiring emergency care'
- 'Step 4: Emergency departments experience significantly higher presentations for
  violence-related trauma during weekend and nighttime periods'
