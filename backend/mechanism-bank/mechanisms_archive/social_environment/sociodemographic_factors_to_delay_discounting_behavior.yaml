mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sociodemographic factors (including poverty, parental education, neighborhood
  disadvantage, racial discrimination) create differential exposures to chronic stress
  and resource scarcity'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress and scarcity affect neurodevelopment, particularly in prefrontal
  cortex regions responsible for executive function and future-oriented thinking'
- 'Step 3: Resource scarcity creates rational adaptation toward immediate rewards
  when future outcomes are uncertain or inaccessible'
- 'Step 4: These structural conditions manifest as steeper delay discounting behavior
  independent of family psychopathology history'
