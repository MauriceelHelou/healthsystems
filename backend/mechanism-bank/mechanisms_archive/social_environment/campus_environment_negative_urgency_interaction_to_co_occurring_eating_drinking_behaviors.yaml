  node_name: Co-occurring Disordered Eating and Binge Drinking
direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus environment lacks integrated programs recognizing that disordered
  eating and problematic alcohol use frequently co-occur through shared underlying
  mechanism (negative urgency)'
- 'Step 2: Siloed campus services (eating disorder programs separate from substance
  use programs) fail to address common root cause of negative affect dysregulation'
- 'Step 3: Female students engage in both behaviors as parallel maladaptive coping
  strategies without institutional intervention addressing the shared mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring behaviors compound health risks without comprehensive campus
  prevention approach'

  description: Negative urgency is significant predictor of both binge drinking and
    disordered eating; integrated programs addressing this shared vulnerability factor
    would be most effective
