mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-SVI neighborhoods have concentrated disadvantage including poverty,
  unemployment, and limited healthcare access'
- 'Step 2: These structural conditions create chronic stress and limited resources
  for health maintenance'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol outlet density is typically higher in disadvantaged neighborhoods
  due to zoning policies'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to preventive care and addiction treatment services in high-SVI
  areas'
- 'Step 5: Individuals in high-SVI areas experience higher rates of progression to
  severe ALD requiring hospitalization'
