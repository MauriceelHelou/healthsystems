mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students use perceptions of same-sex peer drinking as reference points
  for what constitutes acceptable and typical alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Inflated perceptions of peer drinking create social pressure to conform
  to perceived group norms'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own drinking behavior upward to match what they believe
  is normative among their peer group'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol consumption becomes reinforced through perceived social
  acceptance and integration'
