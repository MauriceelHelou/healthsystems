- 'Step 1: Sports betting advertisements feature multiple characters engaged in social
  interactions (friendship bonding scenarios)'
- 'Step 2: Beer consumption is specifically integrated into these social bonding narratives
  within the betting context'
- 'Step 3: The association between social sports viewing, friendship bonding, and
  beer drinking becomes normalized through repeated exposure'
- 'Step 4: Environmental cues linking social sports betting contexts with beer consumption
  increase likelihood of beer drinking behavior'
