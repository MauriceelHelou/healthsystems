direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism, colonial dispossession, and intergenerational trauma
  create conditions of social and economic marginalization for Indigenous populations'
- 'Step 2: These structural conditions concentrate Indigenous persons in environments
  with limited resources, higher alcohol outlet density, and inadequate social services'
- 'Step 3: Indigenous ethnicity is an independent risk factor for prior interpersonal
  violence presentations, indicating recurrent exposure to violence'
- 'Step 4: Evidence of alcohol intake combined with Indigenous ethnicity predicts
  both incident and recurrent interpersonal violence injuries requiring hospitalization'
