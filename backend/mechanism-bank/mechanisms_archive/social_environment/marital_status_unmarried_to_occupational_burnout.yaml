direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unmarried GPs may have less social support and fewer emotional resources
  outside of work to buffer occupational stress'
- 'Step 2: Without partner support, work-related stressors may have greater psychological
  impact and fewer outlets for emotional processing'
- 'Step 3: Limited social support networks reduce resilience to chronic workplace
  demands and emotional challenges'
- 'Step 4: Reduced buffering capacity and support leads to higher susceptibility to
  emotional exhaustion and depersonalization'
