- 'Step 1: Higher quality parental care provides emotional support and secure attachment
  during childhood development'
- 'Step 2: Secure attachment and positive parental bonding reduce vulnerability to
  substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 3: Protective parental environment mediates genetic risk factors for cannabis
  use initiation'
- 'Step 4: Environmental protective factors can override genetic predisposition to
  reward deficiency syndrome behaviors'
