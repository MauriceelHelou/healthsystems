- 'Step 1: Incarceration disrupts employment, housing, and social connections, creating chronic stress'
- 'Step 2: Prison healthcare is often inadequate, leading to delayed diagnosis and poor disease management'
- 'Step 3: Post-release barriers (employment discrimination, housing restrictions) perpetuate economic
  instability'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare access barriers post-release due to insurance gaps and provider discrimination'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated disadvantage manifests as accelerated chronic disease progression and complications'

description: Criminal legal system exposure is associated with worse chronic disease outcomes including
  diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions. Among those with diabetes, incarceration
  history is associated with higher ED and inpatient utilization, reflecting both disease severity and
  barriers to primary care access.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: institutional
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Mass incarceration disproportionately affects Black and low-income communities
    due to systemic racism in policing, prosecution, and sentencing. The health consequences of incarceration
    are concentrated in already marginalized populations, compounding existing health inequities. Criminal
    legal reform and decarceration are necessary to address root causes.
assumptions:
- Criminal legal system exposure includes any arrest, conviction, or incarceration
- Chronic disease outcomes include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease
- Mechanism operates through both direct (healthcare disruption) and indirect (socioeconomic) pathways
limitations:
- Selection effects difficult to address (factors leading to incarceration may also affect health)
- Data on incarceration history often limited in health datasets
- Most research from US context with unique criminal legal system
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Incarceration rates, prison healthcare quality, and post-release support vary dramatically
    by state and county.
  relevant_geographies:
  - States with high incarceration rates show population-level health impacts
  - Counties with better reentry services show improved post-release outcomes
  - States with Medicaid expansion provide better continuity of care
