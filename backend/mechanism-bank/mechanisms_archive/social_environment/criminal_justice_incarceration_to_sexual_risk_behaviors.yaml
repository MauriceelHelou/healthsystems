direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incarceration physically restricts access to sexual partners and opportunities
  for sexual activity through confinement'
- 'Step 2: Post-release period involves reintegration challenges and supervised release
  conditions that may limit social interactions'
- 'Step 3: Reduced sexual activity and fewer sexual partners lead to decreased overall
  sexual risk behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Among those engaging in sexual activity post-release, participation in
  healthcare systems increases viral suppression rates, further reducing transmission
  risk'
