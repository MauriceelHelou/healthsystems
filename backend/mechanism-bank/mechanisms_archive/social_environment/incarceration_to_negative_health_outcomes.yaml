direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prison environments create conditions for inadequate sleep through structural
  risk factors (noise, stress, lack of control, environmental hazards)'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate sleep in the form of insomnia and poor sleep quality becomes
  prevalent (affecting up to 88.2% of prison population)'
- 'Step 3: Sleep deprivation and poor sleep quality are established precursors to
  multiple negative health outcomes including cardiovascular disease, mental health
  disorders, immune dysfunction, and mortality'
- 'Step 4: Concentrated exposure to sleep-disrupting conditions in prison populations
  produces elevated rates of associated negative health outcomes'
