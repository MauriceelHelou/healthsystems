  node_name: Early Drinking as Marker of Broader Risk-Taking
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Population-level interventions including policy changes, alcohol marketing
  restrictions, and shifting social norms reduced overall youth drinking prevalence'
- 'Step 2: As alcohol consumption became less normative among teenagers, experimentation
  shifted from a common developmental behavior to an indicator of vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Youth who initiate drinking early in a context where most peers abstain
  increasingly represent those with multiple risk factors (family dysfunction, socioeconomic
  stress, exposure to marketing)'
- 'Step 4: Early drinking thus becomes a progressively more powerful marker of broader
  risk-taking tendencies and vulnerability to multiple adverse outcomes'
