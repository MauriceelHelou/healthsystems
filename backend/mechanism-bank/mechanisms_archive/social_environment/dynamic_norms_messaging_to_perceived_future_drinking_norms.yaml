direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dynamic norms messaging communicates that drinking behavior is decreasing
  over time among peers'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to information about shifting social norms shapes cognitive representations
  of future peer behavior'
- 'Step 3: Students recalibrate their expectations about what drinking levels will
  be normative in the future'
- 'Step 4: Perceived future drinking norms decrease as students internalize the message
  that peer drinking is declining'
