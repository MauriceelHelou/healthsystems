direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Major sporting events create concentrated contexts where alcohol is heavily
  marketed and served without consistent service policies across hospitality providers'
- 'Step 2: Lack of coordinated alcohol service standards and training among event
  hospitality providers leads to inconsistent monitoring and control of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Immersive brand experience environment normalizes excessive alcohol consumption
  as part of the event culture'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol intoxication among attendees creates unsafe environment
  and increases risk of violence and negative health outcomes'
