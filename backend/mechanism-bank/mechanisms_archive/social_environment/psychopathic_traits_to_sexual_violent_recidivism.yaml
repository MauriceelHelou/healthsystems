mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychopathic characteristics measured by PCL-R reflect interpersonal, affective,
  and behavioral traits associated with reduced empathy and impulse control'
- 'Step 2: These traits increase propensity for antisocial behavior and reduce responsiveness
  to conventional behavioral deterrents'
- 'Step 3: Psychopathy scores significantly predict sexual and violent reoffending
  within 5 years of release from incarceration'
- 'Step 4: The effect is amplified when combined with substance use dependencies'
