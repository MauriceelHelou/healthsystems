direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher tourist pressure in neighborhoods increases commercial activity
  oriented toward alcohol consumption (bars, restaurants, nightlife venues)'
- 'Step 2: Tourism-oriented areas normalize recreational alcohol consumption and create
  permissive social environments around drinking'
- 'Step 3: Increased visibility of public drinking behaviors and reduced social controls
  in tourist-heavy areas'
- 'Step 4: Adolescents in these neighborhoods experience greater exposure to drinking
  culture leading to higher rates of binge drinking'
