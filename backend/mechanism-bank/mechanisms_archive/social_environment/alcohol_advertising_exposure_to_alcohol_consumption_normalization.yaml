- 'Step 1: Industry asserts that strong advertising regulations are not necessary,
  influencing policy to maintain weak or voluntary advertising controls'
- 'Step 2: Weak regulations allow widespread alcohol marketing across multiple media
  platforms and environments'
- 'Step 3: Population exposure to alcohol advertising normalizes drinking, influences
  consumption patterns, and shapes cultural norms around alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Increased population-level consumption and normalized heavy drinking patterns
  lead to elevated alcohol-related harms'
