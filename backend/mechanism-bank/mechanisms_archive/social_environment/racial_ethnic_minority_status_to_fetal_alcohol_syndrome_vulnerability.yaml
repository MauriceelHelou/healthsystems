  node_name: Increased FAS Vulnerability at Equivalent Alcohol Exposure
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential exposure to chronic stressors, environmental
  toxins, food insecurity, and healthcare barriers for racial/ethnic minorities'
- 'Step 2: Cumulative disadvantage affects maternal nutritional status, metabolic
  function, and physiological stress responses during pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to quality prenatal care delays detection and intervention
  for alcohol use during pregnancy'
- 'Step 4: At equivalent alcohol exposure levels, White, Black, and AI/AN mothers
  show 10-13% increased risk of FAS compared to reference groups'
