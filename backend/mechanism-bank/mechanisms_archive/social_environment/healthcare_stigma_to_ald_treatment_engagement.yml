description: Institutional stigma within healthcare systems creates barriers to effective ALD treatment
  through discriminatory provider attitudes that reduce patient engagement and care quality.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism demonstrates how cultural attitudes embedded in healthcare institutions
    create systematic treatment barriers. Stigma is institutionalized through medical training, organizational
    culture, and policy frameworks that moralize addiction. Equity implication: Marginalized populations
    face intersectional stigma, experiencing compounded discrimination based on alcohol use plus race,
    class, or other identities.'
