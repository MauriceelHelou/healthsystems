- 'Step 1: Commercial alcohol industry creates marketing environments with high-volume
  alcohol advertisement exposure targeting youth audiences'
- 'Step 2: Adolescent exposure to alcohol advertisements increases through unregulated
  or weakly regulated marketing channels'
- 'Step 3: Marketing exposure creates normalization of heavy drinking patterns and
  promotes high-volume consumption'
- 'Step 4: Youth who have not previously engaged in binge drinking initiate this higher-risk
  drinking pattern within 12-24 months of exposure'
