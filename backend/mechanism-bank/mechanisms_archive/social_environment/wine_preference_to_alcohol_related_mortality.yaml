to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_related_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Mortality
direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Wine preference may serve as a marker for higher socioeconomic status and
  associated protective social contexts'
- 'Step 2: Wine consumption is often embedded in meal-centered, moderate drinking
  patterns rather than episodic heavy drinking'
- 'Step 3: Polyphenols and other bioactive compounds in wine may provide some metabolic
  or cardiovascular protection'
- 'Step 4: Social contexts of wine drinking (e.g., with meals, in social settings)
  may promote slower consumption and better metabolic processing'
- 'Step 5: Wine preference may reflect broader lifestyle patterns including diet quality,
  healthcare access, and stress management that buffer alcohol-related harm'
