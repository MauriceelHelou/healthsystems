  mechanism to connect with SGM peers during COVID-19 isolation'

  become inaccessible due to shelter-in-place mandates'
- 'Step 3: Peer networks adapt by organizing social drinking via social networking
  sites as alternative form of social connection'
- 'Step 4: Virtual social drinking provides simultaneous functions: coping mechanism
  for stress, combat against isolation and boredom, and maintenance of SGM community
  bonds'
- 'Step 5: Social drinking behavior becomes normalized and prominent within online
  SGM peer networks during shelter-in-place period'
