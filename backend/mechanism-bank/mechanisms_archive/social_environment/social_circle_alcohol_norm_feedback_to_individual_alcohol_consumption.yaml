direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students receive specific, one-time feedback about the actual distribution
  of alcohol consumption within their clearly defined social circle'
- 'Step 2: This feedback provides accurate information that contrasts with overestimated
  perceptions of peer drinking'
- 'Step 3: The corrective information potentially reduces perceived normative pressure
  to drink at elevated levels'
- 'Step 4: However, the intervention did not clearly affect estimation accuracy or
  alcohol consumption, suggesting the feedback mechanism was insufficient to overcome
  existing social influences'

  description: Network-based, individually-adjusted social circle feedback is more
    specific than general peer feedback but still showed limited effectiveness for
    alcohol norms
- name: feedback_frequency
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: One-time feedback may be insufficient; repeated exposure might be necessary
    for behavioral change

  direction: u_shaped
  strength: weak
  description: Feedback may be more effective for those who overestimate norms most
    severely, but could potentially increase consumption among those who underestimate
