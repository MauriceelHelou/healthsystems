- 'Step 1: Parental AUD impairs parenting capacity through intoxication, preoccupation with substance
  use, and emotional unavailability'
- 'Step 2: Household chaos and unpredictability create emotionally unsafe environment (household dysfunction
  ACE)'
- 'Step 3: Economic instability from addiction-related job loss and spending increases household hardship
  and neglect risk'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of emotional/physical abuse during intoxication and intimate partner violence
  exposure'
- 'Step 5: Children experience multiple ACE domains: household substance use, abuse, neglect, and often
  parental separation/incarceration'

structural_competency:

  equity_implications: The intergenerational transmission of trauma through parental addiction reflects
    systematic failure to support families experiencing addiction. Rather than providing accessible treatment,
    childcare, economic support, and family services, the response is often punitive child removal that
    compounds trauma. Parents of color with addiction face disproportionate child welfare involvement
    and termination of parental rights. The pathway from parent AUD to child ACEs is not inevitable but
    reflects policy choices to criminalize and separate families rather than provide treatment and support.
    High ACE rates in certain communities represent intergenerational accumulation of structural harm
    including historical trauma, poverty, and treatment inaccessibility. Interrupting this cycle requires
    family-centered treatment, economic support, home visiting programs, and addressing root causes that
    generate parent addiction in the first place.
assumptions:
- Parental AUD measured during child-rearing years (child ages 0-18)
- ACEs include the 10 standard categories from original ACE Study
- Mechanism assumes limited access to family-centered treatment and support
limitations:
- Not all children of parents with AUD experience high ACEs; protective factors matter
- Severity of parental AUD and co-occurring disorders affects child impact
- Standard ACE measure may not capture full range of addiction-related adversities
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Child protective services involvement and family support access vary dramatically by
    region and resource availability
  relevant_geographies:
  - Communities with family-centered addiction treatment show better child outcomes
  - Areas with robust home visiting and parent support reduce ACE accumulation
  - Regions with punitive child welfare approaches increase trauma from family separation
  - Rural areas with treatment deserts leave families without intervention options
