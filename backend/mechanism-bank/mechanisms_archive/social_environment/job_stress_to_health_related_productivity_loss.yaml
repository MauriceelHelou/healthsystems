mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Job stress in R&D work environments creates direct psychological and physical
  strain on workers'
- 'Step 2: Chronic occupational stress impairs sleep quality, creating insomnia and
  sleep disturbances (mediating pathway)'
- 'Step 3: Both direct stress effects and sleep-mediated pathways reduce worker cognitive
  function and health status'
- 'Step 4: Combined direct and indirect effects lead to increased health-related productivity
  loss including absenteeism and presenteeism'
