direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Athletic participation at college matriculation creates social group membership
  with established team cultures and bonding rituals that often include alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Athletes are exposed to heightened peer drinking norms specific to athletic
  team environments where drinking may be normalized as stress relief or celebration'
- 'Step 3: Team social structures create frequent opportunities for alcohol consumption
  through team events, parties, and informal gatherings'
- 'Step 4: Athletic status may confer perceived invulnerability or special status
  that reduces perceived consequences of heavy drinking'
