  and hyperarousal'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to trauma-informed mental health services leaves violence-related distress untreated'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol use emerges as accessible self-medication for trauma symptoms and sleep disturbance'
- 'Step 5: Escalating drinking develops into binge pattern as maladaptive coping for ongoing violence
  exposure and unresolved trauma'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: policy
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: 'High violent crime is not random but concentrates in communities experiencing
    structural abandonment and disinvestment. Decades of segregation, discriminatory policing, limited
    economic opportunity, and defunded social services create conditions where violence flourishes. Communities
    of color face both higher violence exposure and greater policing that criminalizes trauma responses.
    The violence-alcohol pathway represents how structural violence (policy-driven inequity) produces
    interpersonal violence, which then generates individual suffering manifesting as substance use. High
    drinking in violence-exposed communities reflects rational coping responses to intolerable conditions.
    Addressing this requires root-cause interventions: economic opportunity, violence prevention programs,
    community investment, and trauma-informed services—not increased criminalization that compounds trauma.'
assumptions:
- Violence exposure includes both direct victimization and witnessing violence
- Mechanism operates through trauma and chronic stress pathways
- Assumes limited access to mental health treatment in high-violence areas
limitations:
- Not all violence-exposed individuals increase drinking; resilience factors matter
- Bidirectional relationship may exist (alcohol use can increase violence risk)
- Individual trauma history and other stressors compound violence effects
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Violent crime concentrates in specific neighborhoods experiencing cumulative structural
    disadvantage
  relevant_geographies:
  - Historically segregated urban neighborhoods show concentrated violence and trauma exposure
  - Communities experiencing deindustrialization and disinvestment have elevated violence
  - Areas with strong community-based violence intervention programs show reduced trauma-alcohol pathways
  - Native American communities face violence from historical trauma and jurisdictional gaps in law enforcement
