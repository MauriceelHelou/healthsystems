- 'Step 1: College transition creates opportunities and constraints for social network
  formation based on institutional structures (dormitories, Greek life, campus activities)'
- 'Step 2: Students with higher social integration become more embedded in peer networks
  during this transition period'
- 'Step 3: Greater embeddedness in peer networks increases exposure to and internalization
  of prevailing peer drinking norms'
- 'Step 4: Social integration predicts whether students maintain stable peer norms
  versus shift to new peer norm profiles'
