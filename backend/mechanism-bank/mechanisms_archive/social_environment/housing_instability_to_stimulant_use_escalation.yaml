to_node:
  node_id: stimulant_use_escalation
  node_name: Stimulant Use Escalation
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates chronic physiological stress response activation
  and trauma exposure'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing reduces access to non-drug-based coping mechanisms (safe
  sleep, social support, routine healthcare)'
- 'Step 3: Stimulants provide functional utility for housing-unstable individuals
  (staying awake for safety, appetite suppression, energy for survival activities)'
- 'Step 4: Street-based drug markets near shelters and encampments increase stimulant
  availability and normalize use patterns'
- 'Step 5: Progressive physiological tolerance and structural barriers to treatment
  escalate use patterns toward fatal overdose risk'

  description: Housing instability creates structural barriers to accessing stimulant
    use disorder treatment (lack of stable address, phone, transportation), allowing
    use escalation without intervention
