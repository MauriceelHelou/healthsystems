mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher social vulnerability reflects concentrated disadvantage including
  poor housing, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to basic services'
- 'Step 2: Vulnerable communities face geographic and economic barriers to accessing
  prenatal care and skilled birth attendance'
- 'Step 3: Social vulnerability correlates with lower health literacy, delayed care-seeking,
  and inadequate social support during pregnancy'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effects of social vulnerability increase risk of maternal complications
  and reduce capacity to respond to obstetric emergencies'
