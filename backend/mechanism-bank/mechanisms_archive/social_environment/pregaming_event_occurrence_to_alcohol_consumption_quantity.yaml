direction: positive

- 'Step 1: Pregaming events create social and physical environments with alcohol-promoting
  stimuli and peer drinking norms'
- 'Step 2: These environments provide contextual cues that facilitate increased alcohol
  consumption prior to main events'
- 'Step 3: The social nature of pregaming normalizes higher drinking quantities as
  part of the preparatory ritual'
- 'Step 4: Individuals consume greater volumes of alcohol during pregaming compared
  to non-pregaming drinking occasions'
