direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Initial lockdown measures disrupt established patterns of social drinking
  behavior'
- 'Step 2: Extended period without regular social drinking contexts allows new behavioral
  patterns to develop'
- 'Step 3: Post-lockdown environment maintains some restrictions or altered social
  norms around gatherings'
- 'Step 4: Regular binge drinkers show sustained reductions in alcohol consumption
  comparable to non-binge drinkers even 6 months post-lockdown'
