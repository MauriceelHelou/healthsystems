  node_name: Self-Stigma of Seeking Mental Health Help
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cultural and social gender norms construct expectations around emotional
  expression and vulnerability (e.g., masculinity norms discouraging help-seeking)'
- 'Step 2: Male nursing students internalize these norms as standards for acceptable
  behavior within their gender identity'
- 'Step 3: Seeking mental health help is perceived as violating gender role expectations,
  particularly around self-reliance and emotional stoicism'
- 'Step 4: This perceived violation generates heightened self-stigma specifically
  among males regarding help-seeking behaviors'
