direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic created widespread workplace disruptions, economic uncertainty,
  and social isolation affecting workers across all sectors'
- 'Step 2: Small employers (97.5% of establishments employing 52% of private workers)
  had limited capacity to respond to exacerbated worker mental health needs'
- 'Step 3: Increased stressors combined with reduced access to workplace support services
  led to increased burden of behavioral health disorders'
- 'Step 4: Workers at small employers faced disproportionate mental health impacts
  due to lack of Employee Assistance Programs and other support resources'
