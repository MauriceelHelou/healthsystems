direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pandemic amplifies existing gendered divisions of labor, concentrating
  caregiving, home schooling, and emotional labor on women'
- 'Step 2: Immediate risks with tangible consequences (viral transmission, family
  wellbeing, managing lockdown) become prioritized'
- 'Step 3: Future health risks with delayed consequences (breast cancer from alcohol)
  become discounted or fade from cognitive view'
- 'Step 4: Women recalibrate their temporal horizons of risk management toward immediate
  survival and coping'
- 'Step 5: Long-term preventive health behaviors become deprioritized relative to
  immediate psychosocial needs'
