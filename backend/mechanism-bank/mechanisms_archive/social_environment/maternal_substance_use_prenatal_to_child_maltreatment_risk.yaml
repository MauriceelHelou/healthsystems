direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal substance use during pregnancy reflects inadequate access to substance
  use treatment and prenatal care services'
- 'Step 2: Substance use impairs maternal capacity for infant care and increases stress
  in caregiving environment'
- 'Step 3: Children are identified by child protection services at birth or early
  life as requiring intervention'
- 'Step 4: Increased surveillance and referrals lead to child protection involvement
  and potential out-of-home care placement'
