direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social stigma around mental health creates cultural norms that frame mental
  health problems as personal weakness or moral failing'
- 'Step 2: Internalized stigma and fear of social judgment create psychological barriers
  to acknowledging mental health needs'
- 'Step 3: Attitudinal barriers lead to avoidance or delay in seeking professional
  mental health treatment despite symptom burden'
- 'Step 4: Low uptake of effective treatment results in persistent mental health problems
  and increased disease burden in youth populations'
