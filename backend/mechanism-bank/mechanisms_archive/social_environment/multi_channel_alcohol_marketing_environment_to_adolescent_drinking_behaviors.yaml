mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry utilizes multiple marketing channels simultaneously (television,
  websites, radio, in-store displays) creating comprehensive exposure environment
  for youth'
- 'Step 2: Different marketing channels operate through distinct mechanisms: television
  affects initiation, while web and radio affect drinking escalation among those already
  experimenting'
- 'Step 3: Channel-specific effects create cumulative exposure pathways that reach
  youth at different stages of drinking trajectory, from initiation through escalation'
- 'Step 4: Unregulated marketing environment allows systematic and sustained exposure
  across multiple platforms, normalizing alcohol use throughout adolescent development'
