- 'Step 1: Higher education increases access to stable employment with health benefits and safe working conditions'
- 'Step 2: Education provides health knowledge and cognitive resources for navigating healthcare systems'
- 'Step 3: Higher income from education enables access to healthier housing, food, and neighborhoods'
- 'Step 4: Educational attainment shapes social networks and social support resources'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative advantage across domains produces lower mortality risk throughout adulthood'

description: Educational attainment demonstrates a consistent dose-response relationship with all-cause mortality across 59 countries. A landmark 2024 Lancet meta-analysis of 603 studies found each additional year of education reduces mortality risk by approximately 1.9%, with effects persisting but attenuating with age. The relationship operates through multiple pathways including employment, income, health behaviors, and healthcare access.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: structural
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Educational attainment reflects upstream structural factors including school funding inequity, residential segregation, and intergenerational wealth transfers. Discriminatory policies (redlining, school segregation) created persistent educational disparities. Policy should address educational quality and access rather than individual attainment alone.
assumptions:
- Educational attainment measured as completed years of formal education
- Mortality includes all causes of death
- Mechanism operates through multiple interdependent pathways
limitations:
- Selection effects may confound estimates (healthier children may attain more education)
- Educational quality varies within attainment levels
- Credential effects may differ from knowledge/skill effects
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effect size varies by country development level and healthcare system
  relevant_geographies:
  - High-income Asia-Pacific shows strong education-mortality gradient
  - United States shows persistent and widening disparities
  - Nordic countries with universal systems may show weaker gradients
