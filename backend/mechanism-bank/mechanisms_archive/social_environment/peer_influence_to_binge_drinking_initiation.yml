mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peer drinking behavior creates normative expectations about alcohol use among adolescents and
  young adults'
- 'Step 2: Social pressure and desire for peer acceptance motivate participation in drinking activities'
- 'Step 3: Observational learning from peers models binge drinking as acceptable or desirable social behavior'
- 'Step 4: Drinking contexts (parties, social gatherings) provide opportunities and encouragement for
  high-volume consumption'
- 'Step 5: Repeated participation in peer drinking leads to habituation, tolerance, and established binge
  drinking pattern'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: institutional
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: 'Peer influence on youth drinking operates within structural contexts that shape
    opportunities and norms. Alcohol industry marketing deliberately targets youth and normalizes binge
    drinking through social media and event sponsorship. Colleges permit drinking cultures that generate
    billions in alumni donations while externalizing health costs. Communities with few youth development
    resources leave young people with limited substance-free social options. Weak enforcement of underage
    drinking laws in white affluent communities contrasts with criminalization in communities of color.
    High youth binge drinking reflects policy choices about alcohol marketing regulation, campus alcohol
    policies, investment in youth programming, and enforcement equity. Reducing peer-driven initiation
    requires structural interventions: marketing restrictions, campus policy reform, universal youth development
    access, and enforcement focused on industry supply rather than youth criminalization.'
assumptions:
- Peer influence strongest during adolescence and young adulthood (ages 13-25)
- Mechanism operates through both active peer pressure and passive modeling
- Social network composition affects individual drinking behavior
limitations:
- Individual susceptibility to peer influence varies by personality and family factors
- Selection effects exist (youth choose peers with similar drinking attitudes)
- Peer influence can also reduce drinking when peer norms are protective
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Peer drinking norms vary by community culture, youth programming availability, and
    enforcement context
  relevant_geographies:
  - College towns show concentrated youth binge drinking during academic year
  - Communities with robust youth programming (sports, arts, employment) show lower initiation
  - Rural areas with limited structured activities may show higher peer-driven drinking
  - Affluent communities with weak underage drinking enforcement normalize youth binge drinking
