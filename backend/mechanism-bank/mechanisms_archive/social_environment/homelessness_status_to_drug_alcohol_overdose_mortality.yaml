direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates conditions of chronic stress, trauma exposure, and
  psychological distress that increase substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing limits access to addiction treatment programs and
  harm reduction services'
- 'Step 3: Street-based substance use occurs in unmonitored environments without access
  to emergency medical response or overdose prevention resources'
- 'Step 4: Combination of untreated addiction, lack of social support, and unsafe
  consumption environments increases fatal overdose risk'
