mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peer recovery support (mutual aid groups, recovery coaches) provides non-judgmental community
  of shared experience'
- 'Step 2: Regular social contact with recovery-oriented peers offers accountability, encouragement, and
  modeling of sober living'
- 'Step 3: Recovery social networks replace substance-using social circles, removing drinking triggers
  and enabling cues'
- 'Step 4: Peer support provides practical assistance (transportation, employment leads, coping strategies)
  during stressful periods'
- 'Step 5: Strong recovery-supportive relationships increase self-efficacy and sustain motivation, reducing
  relapse and maintaining remission'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: institutional
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: While peer support is evidence-based, access is inequitably distributed. Mutual
    aid meetings concentrate in affluent areas while underserved communities lack options. Professional
    peer support services are rarely Medicaid-reimbursed, creating access barriers for low-income individuals.
    Transportation barriers in car-dependent areas prevent participation. Recovery housing has proliferated
    in some regions but faces NIMBY zoning resistance. Culturally specific recovery supports (BIPOC, LGBTQ+,
    women-only) are scarce. The effectiveness of peer support paradoxically highlights how social isolation
    and lack of community connection drive addiction in the first place—conditions created by structural
    arrangements. Universal access to peer recovery support requires Medicaid reimbursement, transportation
    assistance, zoning reform for recovery housing, and community investment in culturally responsive
    programming.
assumptions:
- Peer support includes both formal services (peer recovery coaches) and informal networks (mutual aid)
- Mechanism operates through social influence, practical support, and identity transformation
- Assumes voluntary participation rather than coerced attendance
limitations:
- Individual heterogeneity in response to peer support; not universally effective
- Quality and philosophy of peer support programs vary widely
- May be less effective without concurrent professional treatment for severe AUD
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Peer support availability varies dramatically by community resources, Medicaid policies,
    and cultural acceptance
  relevant_geographies:
  - Urban areas have greater diversity of mutual aid options (AA, SMART, Refuge Recovery, etc.)
  - Rural areas often lack regular meetings within reasonable travel distance
  - States with Medicaid peer support services show broader access beyond volunteer meetings
  - Recovery housing concentrates in certain cities/neighborhoods with variable quality and regulation
