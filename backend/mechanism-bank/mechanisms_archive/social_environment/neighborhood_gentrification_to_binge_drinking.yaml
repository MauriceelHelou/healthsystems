direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gentrification brings influx of capital and higher socioeconomic status
  residents into historically-disinvested neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Neighborhood transformation creates social and financial pressures on existing
  residents through rising costs, displacement threats, and community disruption'
- 'Step 3: These stressors and community changes contribute to increased psychological
  distress and coping behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Residents respond to gentrification-related stress through increased excessive
  alcohol consumption and binge drinking'

  description: Gentrification is significantly associated with binge drinking among
    residents living in neighborhood <5 years (AOR=1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.93), but shows
    no association among those living in neighborhood ≥5 years. Suggests newer residents
    experience greater impact from gentrification pressures
