direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Initial violent injury indicates exposure to structural conditions and
  environments where violence is prevalent'
- 'Step 2: Trauma from violence may lead to psychological distress, hypervigilance,
  or other trauma responses that affect interactions'
- 'Step 3: Lack of systemic interventions to change underlying structural conditions
  (housing, economic security) leaves survivors in same high-risk environments'
- 'Step 4: Continued exposure to same structural vulnerabilities maintains elevated
  risk of repeated violence'
