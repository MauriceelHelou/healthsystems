- 'Step 1: Family and social commitments create time demands that compete with sleep
  opportunity and schedule'
- 'Step 2: Caregiving responsibilities, household management, and social obligations
  reduce available time for sleep and disrupt sleep timing'
- 'Step 3: Time constraints result in reduced sleep duration, irregular sleep schedules,
  and increased sleep latency'
- 'Step 4: Chronic sleep restriction and schedule irregularity degrade overall sleep
  quality and associated health outcomes'
