direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Professional development component delivers ongoing social media posts
  on advanced RBS skills and support from experienced servers over 12 months'
- 'Step 2: Regular exposure to RBS content and peer support reinforces training concepts
  and provides problem-solving resources during the 3-5 year gap between required
  retraining'
- 'Step 3: Servers develop increased confidence in their ability to apply RBS skills
  in real-world situations through continued skill building and social support'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced self-efficacy translates to more consistent application of service
  refusal practices when encountering intoxicated patrons'
