direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential access to prenatal and postpartum
  OUD treatment services for Black birthing individuals'
- 'Step 2: Black individuals with OUD experience systemic barriers to receiving MOUD
  and comprehensive care components during prenatal and postpartum periods'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to evidence-based OUD treatment increases risk of overdose
  events, emergency department visits, and acute inpatient stays'
- 'Step 4: Systemic barriers persist through the postpartum transition period, resulting
  in higher rates of OUD-related hospital use among Black postpartum individuals'

  description: Postpartum OUD-related hospital events were less frequent for individuals
    receiving versus not receiving postpartum MOUD within 30 days prior to the event,
    suggesting MOUD receipt moderates the disparity
