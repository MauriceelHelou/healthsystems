  node_name: Elevated Industry Prevalence of Employee Stress
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mining industry sector characteristics include physically hazardous work,
  remote/isolated locations, demanding production schedules, and high-pressure environments'
- 'Step 2: Industry-wide structural conditions create elevated exposure to occupational
  stressors across the mining workforce'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to sector-specific stressors (physical danger, isolation,
  shift work, production pressure) accumulates psychological burden'
- 'Step 4: Sector-wide stress exposure patterns result in ''elevated industry prevalence
  of stress'' compared to other employment sectors'
