direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical trauma, forced relocation, and ongoing structural discrimination
  create cumulative stress and limited economic opportunities in AI/AN communities'
- 'Step 2: Geographic isolation on reservations limits access to prenatal care, mental
  health services, and substance use treatment programs'
- 'Step 3: Intergenerational trauma and lack of culturally appropriate support services
  contribute to higher rates of substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: AI/AN mothers experience highest average alcohol exposure during pregnancy
  (mean 42.62 grams among those with FAS babies)'
