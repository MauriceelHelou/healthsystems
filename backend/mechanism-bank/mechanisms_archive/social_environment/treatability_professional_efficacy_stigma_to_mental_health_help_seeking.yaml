direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stigmatized beliefs about treatability and professional efficacy become
  embedded in community narratives and social norms'
- 'Step 2: These beliefs reduce perceived value and effectiveness of professional
  mental health treatment within the community'
- 'Step 3: Reduced belief in treatment efficacy creates structural disincentives for
  help-seeking, particularly among high-stigma demographic groups'
- 'Step 4: Lower help-seeking rates result in delayed or absent treatment access and
  poorer mental health outcomes'
