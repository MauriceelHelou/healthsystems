  node_name: Heavy Episodic Drinking (3+ drinks per occasion) Among Older Adults
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal changes over time alter normative drinking patterns, not just
  frequency but also quantity consumed per occasion'
- 'Step 2: Structural factors including marketing, retail practices, and social settings
  normalize higher consumption quantities'
- 'Step 3: Social environments increasingly accommodate and encourage consumption
  of multiple drinks per occasion'
- 'Step 4: Increased probability of consuming three or more drinks on typical drinking
  days'
