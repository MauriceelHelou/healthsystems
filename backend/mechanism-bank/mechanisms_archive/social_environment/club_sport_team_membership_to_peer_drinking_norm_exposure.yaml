direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Institutional structures in colleges organize students into intact social
  groups through club sport team participation'
- 'Step 2: These teams create proximal social environments with frequent interaction,
  shared activities, and group identity formation'
- 'Step 3: Team membership concentrates students'' exposure to specific peer groups
  whose attitudes and behaviors become particularly salient'
- 'Step 4: The cohesive nature of sport teams amplifies the visibility and salience
  of peer drinking behaviors and approval patterns'
- 'Step 5: Students become embedded in normative contexts where peer group drinking
  norms are highly accessible and influential'
