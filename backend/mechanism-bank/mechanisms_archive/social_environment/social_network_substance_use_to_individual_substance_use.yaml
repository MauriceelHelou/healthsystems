- 'Step 1: Social networks provide norms, opportunities, and social contexts for substance
  use behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Network members'' substance use patterns shape individual access to substances
  and normalization of use'
- 'Step 3: Changes in network substance use characteristics over time predict subsequent
  changes in individual substance use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Specific network characteristics (proximity, location met, social support)
  differentially influence particular substance types'
