category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Income segregation concentrates low-income populations in specific geographic
  areas with limited healthcare infrastructure and hospital capacity'
- 'Step 2: Segregated low-income neighborhoods experience higher population density
  and multigenerational housing, facilitating viral transmission'
- 'Step 3: Spatial segregation by income creates differential access to public health
  information, testing sites, and vaccination centers'
- 'Step 4: Income-segregated areas have reduced political power and resource allocation,
  leading to inadequate public health response infrastructure during pandemic'
