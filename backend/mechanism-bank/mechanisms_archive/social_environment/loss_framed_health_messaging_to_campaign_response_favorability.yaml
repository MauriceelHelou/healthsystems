direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public health campaigns deploy loss-framed messages emphasizing negative
  consequences of irresponsible drinking'
- 'Step 2: In social environments with unhealthy peer norms, loss-framed messages
  are less effective at activating deviance regulation'
- 'Step 3: Students may perceive loss-framed messages as aligned with existing unhealthy
  norms rather than motivating distancing from them'
- 'Step 4: This results in less favorable responses to campaign advertisements compared
  to gain-framed approaches'
