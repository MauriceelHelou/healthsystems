direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice policies criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol
  use disorders (public intoxication, alcohol-related violence, driving violations)'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with alcohol use disorders face barriers to community-based
  treatment due to cost, stigma, and limited service availability'
- 'Step 3: Untreated alcohol use disorders contribute to behaviors that increase criminal
  justice contact'
- 'Step 4: Prison systems concentrate individuals with alcohol use disorders without
  providing adequate treatment infrastructure or post-release continuity of care'
