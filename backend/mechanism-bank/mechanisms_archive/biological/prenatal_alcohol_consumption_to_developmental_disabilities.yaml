direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during pregnancy affects developing fetal brain structures
  and neural pathways'
- 'Step 2: Disruption of neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and myelination processes
  occurs'
- 'Step 3: Altered brain development manifests as cognitive, behavioral, and developmental
  impairments'
- 'Step 4: These neurological impacts persist as long-term developmental disabilities
  throughout childhood and beyond'
