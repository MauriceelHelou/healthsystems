direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol consumption at age 40 initiates long-term neurotoxic cascades
  affecting brain structure'
- 'Step 2: Sustained or cumulative effects of early alcohol exposure continue to impact
  brain aging trajectories through mid-life'
- 'Step 3: Progressive brain atrophy and structural deterioration accumulate over
  22 years following initial exposure period'
- 'Step 4: By age 62, continued advanced brain aging is measurable as older predicted
  brain age, though effect magnitude diminishes from age 56'

    the alcohol-brain aging association, indicating heritable factors moderate this
    long-term relationship
