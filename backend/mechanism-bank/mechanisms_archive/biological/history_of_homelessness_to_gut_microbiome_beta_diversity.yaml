direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness leads to altered dietary patterns with lower healthy eating
  index scores'
- 'Step 2: Poor diet quality and food insecurity change the composition and diversity
  of gut microbial communities'
- 'Step 3: Co-occurring alcohol and substance use disorders associated with homelessness
  further disrupt microbiome composition'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress, environmental exposures, and reduced healthcare access
  compound microbiome alterations'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effects result in significantly different beta diversity (between-sample
  microbial community differences) compared to never-homeless individuals'
