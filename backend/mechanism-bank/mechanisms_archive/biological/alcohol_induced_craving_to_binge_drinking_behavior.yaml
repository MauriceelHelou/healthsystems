to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking_behavior
  node_name: Binge Drinking Behavior
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure triggers craving through activation of mesolimbic reward
  pathways'
- 'Step 2: Elevated craving increases motivation to continue alcohol consumption within
  a drinking session'
- 'Step 3: In high-risk individuals with genetic vulnerability, alcohol-induced craving
  drives consumption to binge levels (≥80 mg% BAC)'
- 'Step 4: Similar craving responses between high-risk and heavy drinkers explain
  similar rates of achieving binge-level exposure'
