direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of family members with AUD indicates greater genetic loading
  and shared familial risk factors'
- 'Step 2: Increased genetic susceptibility affects neurobiological reward pathways
  and impulse control mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Combined genetic and environmental familial exposures increase vulnerability
  to developing AUD'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative familial risk factors manifest as clinical AUD diagnosis'
