- 'Step 1: Risky alcohol consumption in HCV-infected patients accelerates progression
  from early to advanced fibrosis stages'
- 'Step 2: Continued alcohol-related hepatocyte injury and inflammation drive bridging
  fibrosis formation'

- 'Step 4: End-stage fibrotic remodeling results in cirrhosis with loss of normal
  liver architecture'
