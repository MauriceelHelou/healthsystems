direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher daily alcohol amounts (>2 drinks/day) exceed cardioprotective threshold'
- 'Step 2: Heavy alcohol consumption causes direct myocardial toxicity, oxidative
  stress, and inflammatory damage'
- 'Step 3: Chronic heavy drinking impairs cardiovascular function and damages vascular
  endothelium'
- 'Step 4: These cumulative effects increase risk of multiple cardiovascular disease
  outcomes'
