direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Daidzein reduces plasma glucose levels in diabetic animals'
- 'Step 2: Anti-hyperglycemic effect combined with NOX-4 inhibition reduces oxidative
  nerve damage'
- 'Step 3: Reduced oxidative stress improves nerve conduction velocity and sensory
  function'
- 'Step 4: Improvements manifest as reduced mechanical hyperalgesia, allodynia, and
  improved tail withdrawal and response latency'
