direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-risk status predicts binge drinking patterns similar to heavy drinkers
  despite lower baseline consumption'
- 'Step 2: Comparable alcohol-induced craving responses suggest shared neurobiological
  vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Repeated binge drinking episodes driven by craving may lead to neuroadaptation
  and tolerance'
- 'Step 4: Progressive neurobiological changes in genetically vulnerable individuals
  increase likelihood of transition to alcohol use disorder'
