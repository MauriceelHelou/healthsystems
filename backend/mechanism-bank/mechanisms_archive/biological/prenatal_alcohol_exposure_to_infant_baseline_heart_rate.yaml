direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure occurs during fetal development affecting cardiovascular
  system formation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol crosses placental barrier and affects fetal cardiac development
  and autonomic nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Developmental changes result in altered cardiac function measurable as
  elevated baseline heart rate in infancy'

moderators:
- name: age_at_heart_rate_measurement
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: When controlling for precise age at measurement using individual patient
    data, the elevated heart rate finding was nullified, with age-matched infants
    showing similar baseline heart rates regardless of PAE (p > 0.05)
- name: gestational_age_at_birth
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: When restricting analysis to full-term infants (excluding premature
    births), differences in baseline heart rate between PAE and control groups were
    eliminated
- name: birth_weight_for_gestational_age
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: When excluding infants who were small for gestational age, differences
    in baseline heart rate between PAE and control groups were no longer observed
- name: control_group_selection
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Studies with control infants showed elevated heart rate in PAE group,
    but few studies included appropriate control groups, limiting the strength of
    this finding
