direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IL-17A and related cytokines (CCL20) are produced by Th17 cells in response
  to chronic inflammatory stimuli'
- 'Step 2: IL-17 signaling promotes recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to
  pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Sustained IL-17-mediated inflammation drives fibrosis and tissue remodeling
  in the pancreas'
- 'Step 4: Chronic IL-17 pathway activation distinguishes chronic pancreatitis from
  acute and recurrent disease states'
