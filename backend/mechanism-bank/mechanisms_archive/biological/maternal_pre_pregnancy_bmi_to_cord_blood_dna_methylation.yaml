direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity creates an altered intrauterine
  metabolic environment during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: This altered metabolic milieu affects fetal epigenetic programming during
  critical developmental windows'
- 'Step 3: Epigenetic modifications occur at specific CpG sites in fetal DNA, altering
  gene expression patterns'
- 'Step 4: These modifications are measurable in cord blood at birth, representing
  persistent epigenetic changes'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: After accounting for the interplay of maternal BMI and smoking, the
    number of associated CpG sites increased from 8 to 481, suggesting smoking modifies
    the epigenetic effects of maternal BMI
