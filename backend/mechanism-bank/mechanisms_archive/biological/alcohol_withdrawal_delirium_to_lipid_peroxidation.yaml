  node_name: Alcohol Withdrawal Complicated by Delirium
to_node:
  node_id: lipid_peroxidation
  node_name: Lipid Peroxidation
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol withdrawal complicated by delirium intensifies free radical processes
  and lipid peroxidation reactions'
- 'Step 2: Increased diene conjugates and thiobarbituric acid products indicate autocatalytic
  self-accelerating lipid peroxidation'
- 'Step 3: Lipid peroxidation damages cell membrane integrity and elasticity'
- 'Step 4: Reduced activity of lipid-dependent membrane-bound enzymes compromises
  cellular function'

  description: Combined thoracic, abdominal, and skeletal trauma creates additional
    oxidative stress that amplifies lipid peroxidation processes beyond that caused
    by alcohol withdrawal alone

  description: Hypoxia from trauma (pneumothorax, hemothorax) significantly deepens
    biochemical disorders and intensifies lipid peroxidation
