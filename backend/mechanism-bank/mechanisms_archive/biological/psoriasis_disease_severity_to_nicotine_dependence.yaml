direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased psoriasis severity creates chronic stress, psychological distress,
  and reduced quality of life'
- 'Step 2: Psychological burden and co-occurring mental health problems (depression,
  anxiety) increase vulnerability to substance use'
- 'Step 3: Nicotine use serves as stress-coping mechanism and self-medication for
  psychological symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Chronic nicotine use patterns develop into dependence in context of ongoing
  disease-related stress'
