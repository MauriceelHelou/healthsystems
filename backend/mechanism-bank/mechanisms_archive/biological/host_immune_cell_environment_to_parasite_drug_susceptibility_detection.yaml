direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parasite susceptibility to antimony compounds is mediated through host
  immune cells, particularly macrophages, where parasites reside'
- 'Step 2: Primary human macrophages and PBMCs reflect individual patient immune function
  variability, which affects detection of inherent parasite drug resistance'
- 'Step 3: Standardized U937 macrophage cell lines provide more consistent immune
  cell environment, reducing host variability'
- 'Step 4: U937 macrophages more effectively discern Sb-resistance through parasite
  survival assays compared to primary human host cells with variable immune function'
