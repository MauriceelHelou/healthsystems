mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: In ischemic heart disease, reduced LVEF reflects extent of myocardial infarction
  and non-viable scar tissue'
- 'Step 2: Ischemic cardiomyopathy is associated with ongoing coronary insufficiency
  and risk of recurrent ischemic events'
- 'Step 3: Progressive ischemia-driven ventricular remodeling creates substrate for
  ventricular arrhythmias'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects of reduced contractility, recurrent ischemia, and arrhythmia
  risk create strong continuous relationship between lower LVEF and mortality in ischemic
  HF'

  description: Significant interaction between HF etiology and LVEF-mortality relationship
    (p=0.0010). In ischemic HF and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, continuous inverse
    association between LVEF and mortality was observed, but not in hypertensive,
    valvular, or other HF types.
