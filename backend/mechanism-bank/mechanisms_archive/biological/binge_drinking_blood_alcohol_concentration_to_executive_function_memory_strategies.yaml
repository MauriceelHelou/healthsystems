direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Repeated high blood alcohol concentration episodes during adolescence cause
  structural and functional alterations in prefrontal cortex regions responsible for
  executive functioning'
- 'Step 2: These neurodevelopmental disruptions impair the ability to spontaneously
  generate and implement effective mnemonic strategies'
- 'Step 3: Reduced executive control capacity limits strategic encoding and organizational
  processes during learning tasks'
- 'Step 4: Adolescent binge drinkers demonstrate less efficient use of memory strategies
  compared to non-binge drinking peers'
