direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients present with lower systolic blood pressure at hospital admission
  but experience significant elevation (≥20 mm Hg) by discharge'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood pressure increases vascular stress and wall tension, potentially
  compromising vessel integrity at catheterization access sites'
- 'Step 3: Higher systolic pressure increases hydrostatic pressure gradient across
  vessel walls and puncture sites'
- 'Step 4: Increased vascular pressure combined with antiplatelet therapy required
  post-PCI elevates bleeding risk at access sites and systemically over 3-year follow-up'
