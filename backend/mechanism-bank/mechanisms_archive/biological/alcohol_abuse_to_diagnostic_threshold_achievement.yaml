direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes recurrent pancreatic inflammation and progressive
  fibrosis'
- 'Step 2: Fibrotic changes increase pancreatic stiffness measurable by point-shear
  wave elastography'
- 'Step 3: Elevated shear wave velocity above diagnostic threshold (>1.2 m/s) indicates
  non-hereditary chronic pancreatitis'
- 'Step 4: Achievement of diagnostic threshold enables clinical identification and
  staging of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis'
