mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol intake acts as a significant risk factor across multiple
  physiological systems'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol impairs judgment and coordination leading to injuries and risky
  sexual behavior'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol compromises immune function increasing susceptibility to infections'
- 'Step 4: Chronic alcohol exposure damages cardiovascular, oncologic, and hepatic
  systems leading to CVD, cancer, and liver disease'
