to_node:
  node_id: wernickes_encephalopathy
  node_name: Wernicke's Encephalopathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine deficiency disrupts cellular energy metabolism in neurons due
  to impaired glucose utilization'
- 'Step 2: Neural tissues with high metabolic demands (mammillary bodies, thalamus,
  brainstem) are preferentially affected'
- 'Step 3: Disruption of neurotransmitter systems occurs secondary to metabolic dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Acute neuropsychiatric symptoms manifest as Wernicke''s Encephalopathy
  including confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia'
