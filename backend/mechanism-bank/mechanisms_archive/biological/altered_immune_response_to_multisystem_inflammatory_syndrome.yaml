direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Some children develop dysregulated immune responses following SARS-CoV-2
  infection'
- 'Step 2: Intense inflammatory cascade is triggered weeks after initial infection'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation affects multiple organ systems simultaneously'
- 'Step 4: Clinical manifestation as MIS-C with cardiac, gastrointestinal, and other
  system involvement'
