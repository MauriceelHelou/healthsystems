mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insomnia disrupts sleep architecture and circadian rhythms, increasing
  physiological stress'
- 'Step 2: Chronic sleep deprivation dysregulates stress response systems and increases
  negative affect'
- 'Step 3: Individuals use alcohol as self-medication for sleep initiation due to
  its sedative properties'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol further fragments sleep and worsens insomnia, creating a bidirectional
  reinforcing cycle'
- 'Step 5: Repeated alcohol use for sleep leads to tolerance, dependence, and progression
  to Alcohol Use Disorder'
