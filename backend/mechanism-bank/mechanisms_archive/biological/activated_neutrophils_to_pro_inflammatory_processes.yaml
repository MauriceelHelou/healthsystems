direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neutrophils become activated and accumulate in inflammatory lung tissues'
- 'Step 2: Activated neutrophils release inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and reactive
  oxygen species'
- 'Step 3: These inflammatory products amplify local and systemic inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 4: Sustained neutrophil activation perpetuates chronic inflammatory state'
