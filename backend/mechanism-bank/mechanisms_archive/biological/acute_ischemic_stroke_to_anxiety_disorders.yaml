mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stroke-induced damage to amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal regions
  disrupts fear regulation and threat assessment circuits'
- 'Step 2: Neuroinflammation and neurotransmitter dysregulation (particularly GABA
  and serotonin) increase anxiety vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Acute medical trauma and hospitalization create psychological stress activating
  anxiety responses'
- 'Step 4: Functional disability and uncertainty about recovery amplify anxiety symptoms
  in early post-stroke period'
