  node_name: Inflammatory Head Mass of Pancreas (IMP)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes recurrent pancreatic inflammation and
  tissue damage'
- 'Step 2: Persistent inflammatory processes lead to fibrosis and structural changes
  in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory changes concentrate in pancreatic head region forming mass-like
  lesions'
- 'Step 4: Inflammatory head mass develops as manifestation of chronic pancreatitis
  rather than malignant transformation'

moderators:
- name: age
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: IMP patients were significantly younger (mean 41.3 years) compared
    to malignancy patients (49.3 years), suggesting alcohol-related IMP develops earlier
    in life
- name: sex
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Male sex associated with IMP (89.7% vs 65% in malignancy group), likely
    reflecting higher alcohol consumption patterns among males
