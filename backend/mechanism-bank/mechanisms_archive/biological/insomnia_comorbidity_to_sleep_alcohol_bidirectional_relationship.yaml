  node_name: Bidirectional Sleep-Alcohol Relationship
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol Use Disorder creates neurobiological changes that disrupt sleep
  architecture and circadian rhythms'
- 'Step 2: At least 40% of individuals with AUD develop comorbid insomnia due to alcohol''s
  effects on sleep maintenance and REM sleep'
- 'Step 3: Chronic insomnia may perpetuate or worsen alcohol use as individuals attempt
  to self-medicate sleep problems'
- 'Step 4: The bidirectional nature creates a self-reinforcing cycle where neither
  condition can fully resolve without addressing both'
