direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tyramine formulated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) is injected into shrimp'
- 'Step 2: PEG formulation prolongs the bioavailability and duration of tyramine in
  the hemolymph'
- 'Step 3: Extended tyramine exposure activates prolonged immune cell proliferation'
- 'Step 4: Increased hemocyte production leads to elevated total hemocyte count maintained
  over extended period'
