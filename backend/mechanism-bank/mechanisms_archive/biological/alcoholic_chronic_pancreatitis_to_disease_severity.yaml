  node_name: Chronic Pancreatitis Disease Severity (M-ANNHEIM Score)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis progresses with increasing pancreatic
  fibrosis and tissue remodeling'
- 'Step 2: Progressive fibrosis increases pancreatic stiffness measurable by shear
  wave velocity'
- 'Step 3: Elevated pancreatic stiffness correlates with development of CP-typical
  complications including pain, morphological changes, and need for hospitalization'
- 'Step 4: Accumulation of complications and functional impairment increases overall
  disease severity as measured by M-ANNHEIM score'
