direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to hepatotoxic effects through acetaldehyde
  accumulation and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 2: Sustained alcohol exposure triggers hepatic inflammation and stellate cell
  activation'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis develops leading to cirrhosis and other chronic liver
  diseases'
- 'Step 4: The burden is highest among individuals older than 55 years, reflecting
  cumulative exposure effects'
