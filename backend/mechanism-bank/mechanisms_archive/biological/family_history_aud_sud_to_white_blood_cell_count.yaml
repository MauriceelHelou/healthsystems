- 'Step 1: Family history of AUD/SUD disrupts neuroendocrine regulation systems'
- 'Step 2: Disrupted neuroendocrine function alters immune system regulation'
- 'Step 3: Immune dysregulation leads to increased circulating leukocytes (WBC, neutrophils,
  monocytes)'
- 'Step 4: Elevated WBC counts manifest prior to onset of AUD/SUD in at-risk individuals'
