direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe hypercalcemia causes direct nephrotoxicity through calcium deposition
  in renal tubules (nephrocalcinosis)'
- 'Step 2: Acute pancreatitis triggers systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
  with hemodynamic instability and renal hypoperfusion'
- 'Step 3: Combined insults of hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury from pancreatitis
  lead to progressive renal damage'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or delayed treatment results in irreversible nephron loss and
  progression to end-stage renal failure'
