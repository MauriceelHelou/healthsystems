to_node:
  node_id: viral_infection_susceptibility
  node_name: Viral Infection Susceptibility
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zinc deficiency impairs immune cell function and reduces cellular defense
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Weakened immune responses reduce the body''s ability to prevent viral entry
  and replication'
- 'Step 3: Compromised antiviral defenses increase susceptibility to various viral
  pathogens'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced vulnerability manifests as higher infection rates and severity
  of viral diseases'
