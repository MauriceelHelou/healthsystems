direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dynamic AFP response (difference between maximum and final pre-transplant
  AFP level) reflects biological responsiveness of tumor to treatment'
- 'Step 2: Favorable AFP-R indicates tumor with less aggressive biological characteristics
  and better treatment response'
- 'Step 3: NYCA score incorporating AFP-R stratifies patients into risk categories
  with distinct recurrence rates'
- 'Step 4: Low-risk category shows 9.5% 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence,
  acceptable-risk 20.5%, and high-risk 40.5%'
