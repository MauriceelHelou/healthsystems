direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Untreated or inadequately treated Wernicke encephalopathy causes progressive
  brain damage'
- 'Step 2: Neurological damage extends to areas controlling memory and cognitive function'
- 'Step 3: Irreversible and long-lasting brain lesions develop leading to Korsakoff
  syndrome'
- 'Step 4: Korsakoff dementia becomes a permanent medical condition with severe cognitive
  impairment'
