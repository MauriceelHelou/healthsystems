direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of addiction reflects intergenerational transmission of
  both genetic variants and shared environmental exposures'
- 'Step 2: Inherited genetic vulnerabilities (as identified through trio sequencing
  of subject and two family members) predispose to altered neurobiological reward
  pathways'
- 'Step 3: Family environment may include modeling of substance use behaviors, reduced
  protective factors, and accumulated stress from addiction-related family disruption'
- 'Step 4: Combined genetic and environmental familial factors increase risk for developing
  severe addiction profiles including polysubstance dependence (alcohol, opioids,
  nicotine)'
