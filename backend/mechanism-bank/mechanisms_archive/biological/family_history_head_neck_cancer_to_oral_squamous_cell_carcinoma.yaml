direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of head and neck cancer suggests specific inherited genetic
  variants affecting head and neck tissue susceptibility'
- 'Step 2: Genetic polymorphisms in alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase
  genes may increase vulnerability to alcohol-related carcinogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Inherited variants in xenobiotic metabolism genes affect processing of
  tobacco carcinogens'
- 'Step 4: Gene-environment interactions between genetic susceptibility and alcohol/tobacco
  exposure increase oral cancer risk'
