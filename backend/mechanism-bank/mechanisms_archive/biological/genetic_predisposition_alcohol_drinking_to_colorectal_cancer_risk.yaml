direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants influence propensity for alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol consumption leads to metabolic byproducts and oxidative
  stress'
- 'Step 3: These biological changes increase mutagenesis and cellular damage in colorectal
  tissue'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative damage increases risk of colorectal cancer development'
