to_node:
  node_id: fetal_alcohol_syndrome
  node_name: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Continuous alcohol exposure throughout all three trimesters provides sustained
  teratogenic exposure during critical periods of fetal development'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and disrupts cellular differentiation,
  neuronal migration, and organogenesis across multiple developmental windows'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged exposure affects craniofacial development, brain structure formation,
  and growth trajectories'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative damage manifests as the characteristic features of FAS including
  facial dysmorphology, growth deficits, and central nervous system abnormalities'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Type of alcohol consumed (beer, wine, or liquor) was identified as
    an important predictor variable, suggesting different beverage types may have
    differential effects on FAS risk
- name: maternal_age
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Maternal age scored highly in overall feature importance for FAS prediction,
    indicating age-related factors modify risk
- name: maternal_race
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Race was identified as highly important in FAS prediction models, reflecting
    structural inequities in exposure, diagnosis, or vulnerability
