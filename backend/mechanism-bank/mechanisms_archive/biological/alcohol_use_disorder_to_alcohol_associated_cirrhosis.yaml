  node_id: alcohol_associated_cirrhosis
  node_name: Alcohol-Associated Cirrhosis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sustained heavy alcohol consumption in AUD populations causes repeated
  hepatic injury and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation leads to progressive fibrosis as hepatic stellate
  cells deposit collagen'
- 'Step 3: Advanced fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis with architectural distortion
  and nodular regeneration'
- 'Step 4: Among AUD populations, 12.9% develop cirrhosis compared to 0.3% in general
  populations'
