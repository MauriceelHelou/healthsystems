mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of illicit substance use (reported by 12% of participants)
  reflects generalized familial risk for substance-related behaviors'
- 'Step 2: This familial substance use history increases Transmissible Liability Index
  scores in offspring'
- 'Step 3: Higher TLI scores indicate broader behavioral disinhibition and risk-taking
  propensities'
- 'Step 4: These behavioral characteristics increase risk for alcohol use and problems
  during the high school to college transition'
