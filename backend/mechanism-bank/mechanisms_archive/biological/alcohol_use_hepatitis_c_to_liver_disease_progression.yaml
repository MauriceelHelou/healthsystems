- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) creates dual
  hepatotoxic exposure'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol potentiates HCV-related liver inflammation and oxidative stress
  through synergistic mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Combined exposure accelerates hepatic fibrosis progression and increases
  risk of cirrhosis development'
- 'Step 4: This results in accelerated negative liver-related outcomes compared to
  HCV or alcohol alone'
