direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep disruption and insomnia alter circadian rhythm regulation and hunger
  hormone signaling (leptin and ghrelin)'
- 'Step 2: Poor sleep quality increases nighttime wakefulness, creating opportunities
  for night-eating episodes'
- 'Step 3: Sleep deprivation impairs prefrontal cortex function, reducing cognitive
  control over eating impulses'
- 'Step 4: Chronic sleep disturbance exacerbates emotional dysregulation and stress
  response, triggers maladaptive eating as coping mechanism'
