direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-associated hepatitis causes acute-on-chronic liver failure with
  higher MELD-Na scores'
- 'Step 2: Higher disease severity leads to multi-organ dysfunction including more
  severe AKI'
- 'Step 3: Combined hepatic and renal dysfunction creates systemic complications'
- 'Step 4: Increased mortality risk within 90 days, though largely mediated by disease
  severity'

  description: MELD-Na score is a strong confounder; when adjusted for MELD-Na, age
    and sex, the association between AH and mortality becomes non-significant, suggesting
    disease severity mediates much of the mortality risk
