direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption (≥40 g/day ethanol) causes direct hepatotoxic
  effects in patients with chronic HCV infection'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol potentiates HCV-related hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Sustained hepatocellular injury leads to progressive fibrogenesis and extracellular
  matrix deposition'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative fibrotic changes result in advanced fibrosis stages in liver
  tissue'
