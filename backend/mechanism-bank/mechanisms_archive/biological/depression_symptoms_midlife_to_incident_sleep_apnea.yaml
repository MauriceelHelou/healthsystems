  node_name: Incident Sleep Apnea
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression symptoms, particularly non-somatic symptoms, alter sleep architecture
  and respiratory control'
- 'Step 2: Chronic sleep disturbances affect upper airway muscle tone and neural control
  of breathing'
- 'Step 3: Over decades, progressive changes in sleep physiology and possible weight
  gain contribute to airway collapse'
- 'Step 4: Clinical sleep apnea develops requiring medical diagnosis and treatment'

- name: non_somatic_depression_symptoms
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: When somatic symptoms were excluded, sleep apnea was the only condition
    that remained significantly associated (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.60), indicating
    non-somatic depression symptoms specifically predict sleep apnea
- name: body_mass_index
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: BMI was controlled for and association remained, suggesting depression
    effect on sleep apnea operates beyond weight-mediated pathways
