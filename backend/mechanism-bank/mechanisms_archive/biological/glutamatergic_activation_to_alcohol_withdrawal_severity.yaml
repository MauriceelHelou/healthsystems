direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes adaptive up-regulation of glutamate
  receptors in the central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol cessation removes inhibitory effects on excitatory neurotransmission'
- 'Step 3: Up-regulated glutamate receptors produce excessive excitatory signaling'
- 'Step 4: Unopposed glutamatergic activation drives severity of withdrawal symptoms
  including potential life-threatening manifestations'
