  node_id: driving_impairment
  node_name: Driving Performance Impairment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol at 0.05% BAC enters the bloodstream and affects central nervous
  system functioning'
- 'Step 2: Neural impairment reduces psychomotor control and cognitive processing
  speed'
- 'Step 3: Degraded neural function manifests as increased variability in lane keeping
  and speed control'
- 'Step 4: Impaired driving performance increases crash risk in urban driving environments'
