  node_id: high_frequency_mixed_aud
  node_name: High-Frequency Mixed AUD Pattern
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic factors influence neurobiological pathways affecting alcohol metabolism,
  reward sensitivity, and impulse control'
- 'Step 2: High genetic vulnerability (61-65% heritability) interacts with environmental
  exposures to produce more severe, persistent AUD patterns'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with high genetic loading experience more rapid progression
  to severe, multi-system AUD involving medical, criminal, and social service systems'
- 'Step 4: High-frequency mixed pattern emerges characterized by multiple registration
  types (four or more) across healthcare and criminal justice systems'
