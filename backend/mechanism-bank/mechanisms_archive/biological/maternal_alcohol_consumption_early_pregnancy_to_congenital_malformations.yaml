mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption during early gestation exposes developing embryo to
  teratogenic effects at critical developmental stages'
- 'Step 2: Teratogenic alcohol exposure disrupts cellular differentiation and organogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted developmental processes lead to structural malformations in forming
  organs and systems'
- 'Step 4: Congenital malformations manifest as permanent structural defects'
