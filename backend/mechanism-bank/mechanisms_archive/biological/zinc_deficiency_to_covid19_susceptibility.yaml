  node_name: COVID-19 Susceptibility
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zinc deficiency compromises immune cell function critical for antiviral
  defense'
- 'Step 2: Impaired immune signaling reduces ability to mount effective response against
  SARS-CoV-2'
- 'Step 3: Weakened cellular immunity increases vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection
  and replication'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced susceptibility leads to higher COVID-19 infection rates and potentially
  more severe outcomes'
