direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sarcopenia reflects severe muscle wasting and protein-energy malnutrition
  common in advanced cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Muscle depletion indicates metabolic derangement and reduced physiologic
  reserve'
- 'Step 3: Reduced reserve capacity decreases ability to respond to acute stressors
  such as infection or hepatic injury'
- 'Step 4: Impaired stress response increases susceptibility to acute-on-chronic liver
  failure'
