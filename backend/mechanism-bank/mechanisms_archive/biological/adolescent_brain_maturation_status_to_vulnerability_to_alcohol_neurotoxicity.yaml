direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The adolescent brain undergoes critical developmental processes including
  synaptic pruning, myelination, and prefrontal-subcortical circuit refinement'
- 'Step 2: These ongoing neurodevelopmental processes create windows of heightened
  neuroplasticity and vulnerability to environmental insults'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol exposure during these sensitive periods disrupts normal developmental
  trajectories more severely than in fully mature brains'
- 'Step 4: Incomplete brain maturation amplifies the neurocognitive impacts of binge
  drinking on executive functioning and verbal memory systems'
