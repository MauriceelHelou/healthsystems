  node_id: sural_nerve_damage

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive nerve fiber damage increases clinical symptom burden (pain,
  numbness, paresthesias)'
- 'Step 2: Greater axonal loss corresponds to more severe sensory symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Reduced sural nerve action potential amplitudes reflect degree of large
  sensory fiber degeneration'
- 'Step 4: Higher NSS scores correlate with lower sural nerve amplitudes through shared
  underlying nerve damage'
