  node_id: phagocytic_activity
  node_name: Phagocytic Activity
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tyramine-PEG formulation provides prolonged biogenic amine stimulation
  to hemocytes'
- 'Step 2: Extended tyramine exposure enhances hemocyte activation and cellular immune
  responses'
- 'Step 3: Activated hemocytes demonstrate increased phagocytic capacity to engulf
  pathogens'
- 'Step 4: Sustained phagocytic activity provides prolonged cellular defense against
  bacterial infections'
