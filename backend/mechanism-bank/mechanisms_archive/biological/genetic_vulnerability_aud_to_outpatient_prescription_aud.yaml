to_node:
  node_id: outpatient_prescription_aud
  node_name: Outpatient/Prescription AUD Pattern
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower genetic vulnerability (20% heritability for both sexes) combined
  with predominantly environmental influences shapes less severe AUD presentation'
- 'Step 2: Environmental and social factors (80% of variance) drive AUD development
  in context of lower biological predisposition'
- 'Step 3: Less severe symptom profile facilitates access to and engagement with outpatient
  medical care rather than crisis services'
- 'Step 4: Outpatient/prescription pattern emerges with mix of outpatient medical
  visits and prescription medication management'
