to_node:
  node_id: hepatorenal_syndrome
  node_name: Hepatorenal Syndrome
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advanced liver cirrhosis causes portal hypertension and activation of vasodilatory
  mechanisms in splanchnic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Systemic vasodilation leads to reduced effective arterial blood volume
  and activation of vasoconstrictor systems (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, sympathetic
  nervous system)'
- 'Step 3: Intense renal vasoconstriction occurs as compensatory mechanism, reducing
  renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate'
- 'Step 4: Progressive renal vasoconstriction results in functional kidney failure
  without structural kidney disease, manifesting as hepatorenal syndrome'
