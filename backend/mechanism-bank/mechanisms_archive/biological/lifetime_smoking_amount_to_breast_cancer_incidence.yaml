  node_name: Breast Cancer Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predisposition to higher lifetime smoking amount increases cumulative
  exposure to tobacco carcinogens'
- 'Step 2: Carcinogens cause DNA damage and epigenetic modifications in breast tissue'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated genetic mutations lead to malignant transformation of breast
  cells'
- 'Step 4: Both estrogen receptor-positive and estrogen receptor-negative tumors develop
  through carcinogenic pathways'
