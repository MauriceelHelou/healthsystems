  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)
to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_associated_liver_disease
  node_name: Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease (ALD)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption from AUD leads to hepatic metabolism of ethanol
  and production of toxic metabolites (acetaldehyde)'
- 'Step 2: Toxic metabolites induce hepatocyte injury, oxidative stress, and inflammatory
  responses in liver tissue'
- 'Step 3: Persistent inflammation and hepatocyte damage progresses to fibrosis, cirrhosis,
  and clinical ALD'

  description: Older adults (>70 years) show increasing ALD prevalence trends in the
    US (APC +0.54%) contrasting with declining global trends, suggesting age amplifies
    the AUD-to-ALD pathway

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: State-level variation with 40 states showing increased ALD prevalence
    suggests structural factors like alcohol policies, healthcare access, and social
    determinants vary by geography
