  node_name: Increased Risk for Alcoholism
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Blunted cortisol and heart rate reactivity reflects dysregulated stress
  response systems'
- 'Step 2: Dysregulated stress systems alter reward processing and risk-taking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Impaired stress responses may increase substance use as compensatory mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Combined with genetic vulnerability (family history), blunted reactivity
  increases alcoholism risk'
