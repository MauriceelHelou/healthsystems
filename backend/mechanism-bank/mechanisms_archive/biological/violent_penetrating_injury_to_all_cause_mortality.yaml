direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Initial violent penetrating injury causes immediate trauma, potential organ
  damage, and physiological stress'
- 'Step 2: Survivors experience long-term physical consequences including chronic
  pain, disability, and organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Psychological trauma (PTSD, depression, anxiety) affects health behaviors
  and physiological stress responses'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to comprehensive trauma recovery services and ongoing medical
  care in marginalized communities increases mortality risk'
- 'Step 5: Risk of violent re-injury further elevates mortality probability over time'
