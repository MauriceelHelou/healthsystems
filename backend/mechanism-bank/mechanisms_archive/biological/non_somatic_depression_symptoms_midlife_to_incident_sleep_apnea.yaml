- 'Step 1: Non-somatic depression symptoms (cognitive and emotional symptoms) affect
  sleep regulation and circadian rhythm systems'
- 'Step 2: Chronic disruption of sleep architecture and neural control mechanisms

  nervous system function during sleep'
- 'Step 4: Sleep apnea develops through mechanisms independent of weight gain or physical
  symptoms'
