direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated blood glucose levels in diabetic patients create a hyperglycemic
  metabolic environment'
- 'Step 2: Chronic hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress and accumulation of advanced
  glycation end products in nerve tissue'
- 'Step 3: These metabolic changes damage peripheral nerve fibers, particularly in
  distal extremities'
- 'Step 4: Progressive nerve damage manifests as diabetic peripheral neuropathy with
  symptoms including pain, tingling, and numbness'
