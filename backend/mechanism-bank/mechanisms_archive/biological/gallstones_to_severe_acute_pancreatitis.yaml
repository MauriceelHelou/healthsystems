direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gallstones obstruct the pancreatic duct or common bile duct'
- 'Step 2: Ductal obstruction causes reflux of bile and increased pancreatic ductal
  pressure'
- 'Step 3: Elevated pressure triggers premature activation of pancreatic enzymes including
  lipase within the pancreas'
- 'Step 4: Abnormal intrapancreatic enzyme activation leads to pancreatic autodigestion
  and acute inflammatory response'
- 'Step 5: Severe inflammatory cascade progresses to severe acute pancreatitis with
  significant mortality risk'
