  node_id: depression_incidence
  node_name: Depression Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder creates neurobiological changes including alterations
  in neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, dopamine, GABA) that regulate mood'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure induces inflammatory responses and oxidative stress
  affecting brain structure and function'
- 'Step 3: Type 2 diabetes diagnosis adds additional stress and disease burden for
  individuals with existing AUD'
- 'Step 4: Combined physiological burden of AUD and T2DM, along with pre-existing
  mental health vulnerabilities, increases susceptibility to depressive episodes'
