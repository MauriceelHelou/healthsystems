direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption alters cellular methylation patterns through metabolic
  intermediates'
- 'Step 2: Specific CpG sites (cg05593667 and cg10045354) at COLCA1/COLCA2 genes undergo
  methylation changes'
- 'Step 3: Methylation at these sites regulates expression of COLCA1/COLCA2 genes'
- 'Step 4: Altered gene expression affects cellular processes related to cancer susceptibility'
