  node_id: hepatocyte_dysfunction

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Repeated alcohol administration (20% ethanol at 2.92 g/kg daily) causes
  direct toxic effects on hepatocytes'
- 'Step 2: Duration-dependent alcohol exposure progressively impairs hepatocyte metabolic
  capacity'
- 'Step 3: Hepatocellular dysfunction manifests as altered metabolic parameters measurable
  in laboratory assays'
- 'Step 4: Impaired hepatocyte function reduces capacity to handle additional metabolic
  stress from acute pancreatitis'

  description: 30 days vs 60 days of chronic alcohol intoxication produces different
    degrees of hepatocyte impairment, with longer exposure causing more severe dysfunction
