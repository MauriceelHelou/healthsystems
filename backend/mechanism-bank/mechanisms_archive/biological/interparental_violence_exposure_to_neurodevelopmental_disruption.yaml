  node_id: neurodevelopmental_disruption
  node_name: Neurodevelopmental Disruption and Mental Health Impairment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Witnessing violence between parents creates repetitive exposure to threatening
  stimuli during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Chronic fear and distress activate stress response systems (HPA axis, autonomic
  nervous system) leading to sustained elevated cortisol and inflammatory markers'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged stress exposure during childhood disrupts normal brain development,
  particularly in regions governing emotion regulation, executive function, and stress
  response'
- 'Step 4: Structural and functional brain changes manifest as mental health disorders
  including depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms'
