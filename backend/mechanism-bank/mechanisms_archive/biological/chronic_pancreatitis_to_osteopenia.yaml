- 'Step 1: Chronic inflammation and fibrosis of pancreatic tissue reduces digestive
  enzyme production'
- 'Step 2: Enzyme deficiency causes maldigestion and malabsorption of macronutrients
  and micronutrients'
- 'Step 3: Chronic malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies lead to negative calcium
  balance'
- 'Step 4: Progressive bone mineral loss results in osteopenia as precursor to osteoporosis'
