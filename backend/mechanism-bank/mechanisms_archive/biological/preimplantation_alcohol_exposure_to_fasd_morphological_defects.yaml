mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute alcohol exposure at preimplantation stage (E2.5; 8-cell stage) disrupts
  early embryonic development'
- 'Step 2: Teratogenic effects of alcohol alter cellular differentiation and organ
  formation processes during critical developmental windows'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted developmental programming persists throughout gestation'
- 'Step 4: Long-term FASD-like phenotypes manifest by late gestation (E18.5) including
  growth restriction, brain malformations, and skeletal delays'

    reduces incidence and severity of alcohol-induced morphological defects

    even single acute exposure leads to long-term developmental consequences
