direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic pancreatitis causes progressive pancreatic exocrine insufficiency'
- 'Step 2: Reduced pancreatic enzyme secretion leads to maldigestion and malabsorption
  of nutrients'
- 'Step 3: Deficiencies in calcium, vitamin D, vitamin K, and overall protein-calorie
  malnutrition develop'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative nutritional deficits result in reduced bone mineral density
  manifesting as osteopathy'
