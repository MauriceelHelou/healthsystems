category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hyperglycemia creates metabolic dysfunction in patients with type 1 diabetes'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic dysfunction leads to damage of C and Aδ nerve fibers'
- 'Step 3: Initial demyelination and remyelination of large nerve fibers occurs'
- 'Step 4: Distal-to-proximal axonal loss develops with characteristic symptoms'
