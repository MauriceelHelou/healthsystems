  node_name: Neuronal Apoptosis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nerve injury triggers cellular stress responses in damaged neurons'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress activate apoptotic signaling
  cascades'
- 'Step 3: Programmed cell death leads to loss of neuronal tissue and impaired neural
  function'
- 'Step 4: Neural histological damage results in persistent sensory deficits'
