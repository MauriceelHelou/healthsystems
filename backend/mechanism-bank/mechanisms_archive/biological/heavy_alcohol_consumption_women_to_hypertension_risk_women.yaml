direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol consumption (above protective threshold) activates sympathetic
  nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Chronic heavy drinking increases cortisol and other stress hormones'
- 'Step 3: Heavy alcohol causes vascular endothelial dysfunction and increases arterial
  stiffness'
- 'Step 4: These mechanisms elevate blood pressure and increase hypertension risk'
