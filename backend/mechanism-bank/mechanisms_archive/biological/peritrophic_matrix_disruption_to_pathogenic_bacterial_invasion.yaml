  node_id: pathogenic_bacterial_invasion
  node_name: Pathogenic Bacterial Invasion of Hemolymph
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Physical disruption of the peritrophic matrix eliminates the structural
  barrier separating gut lumen from hemolymph'
- 'Step 2: Loss of barrier integrity allows pathogenic bacteria from gut microbiota
  to cross into internal tissues'
- 'Step 3: Pathogenic bacteria, including Enterobacter cloacae, invade the hemolymph
  (circulatory system)'
- 'Step 4: Bacterial translocation from gut to circulation establishes systemic infection'
