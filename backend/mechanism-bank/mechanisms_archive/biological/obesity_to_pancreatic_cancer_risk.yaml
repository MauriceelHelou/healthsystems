direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Obesity creates a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation with
  elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6)'
- 'Step 2: Adipose tissue dysfunction leads to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia,
  which promotes cell proliferation'
- 'Step 3: Elevated insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) activate signaling
  pathways that stimulate pancreatic cell growth and inhibit apoptosis'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and growth factor dysregulation
  create favorable conditions for malignant transformation in pancreatic tissue'
