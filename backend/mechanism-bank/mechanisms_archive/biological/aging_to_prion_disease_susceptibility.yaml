mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Aging alters the abundance and function of specific immune cell populations'
- 'Step 2: Age-related changes affect immune cell activation status in secondary lymphoid
  organs'
- 'Step 3: Modified immune responses in lymph nodes and spleen affect prion targeting
  and replication'
- 'Step 4: Altered immune surveillance increases susceptibility to prion disease transmission'
