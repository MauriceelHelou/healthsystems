  node_id: groove_pancreatitis
  node_name: Groove Pancreatitis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption causes direct toxic effects on pancreatic
  acinar cells in the pancreaticoduodenal groove region'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to inflammation and fibrosis in the groove
  area comprising the head of pancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct'
- 'Step 3: Progressive inflammatory changes result in chronic pancreatitis specifically
  localized to the groove anatomical region'
- 'Step 4: Persistent inflammation and structural changes manifest as groove pancreatitis
  with characteristic clinical presentation'
