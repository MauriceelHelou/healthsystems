  node_name: Court-Mandated Intervention Program Dropout Rate
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Deficits in decoding emotional facial signals impair social cognition and
  interpersonal functioning'
- 'Step 2: Reduced emotional processing capacity limits ability to understand and
  engage with intervention content focused on empathy and emotional regulation'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive errors and perseverative errors reduce learning capacity and
  behavioral flexibility needed for treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Impaired cognitive functioning, especially when combined with alcohol misuse,
  increases likelihood of intervention program dropout'

    creates particularly high dropout risk. Dropouts with high alcohol consumption
    showed significantly worse emotional decoding and more cognitive errors than other
