direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs in children and adolescents, initiating immune
  and inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 2: Viral infection triggers persistent multi-system pathophysiological changes
  affecting neurological, gastrointestinal, sensory, and other organ systems'
- 'Step 3: These systemic changes manifest as prolonged symptoms across multiple domains
  including neurocognitive function, pain, fatigue, and sensory alterations'
- 'Step 4: Symptom persistence extends well beyond acute infection phase (median 506-556
  days), affecting quality of life and overall health status'

  description: School-age children (6-11 years) showed 4 unique symptoms not present
    in adolescents, while adolescents (12-17 years) showed 3 unique symptoms. Symptom
    clustering patterns differed with 4 phenotypes in school-age children versus 3
    in adolescents. Symptom profiles emphasize neurocognitive, pain, and gastrointestinal
    symptoms in school-age children but change or loss in smell/taste, pain, and fatigue/malaise
    in adolescents.

  direction: persistence
  strength: moderate
  description: Median time between first infection and symptom survey was 506 days
    for school-age children and 556 days for adolescents, indicating prolonged symptom
    duration extending well beyond acute infection phase
