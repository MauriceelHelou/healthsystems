  node_name: Head Trauma and Injury Severity
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol intoxication impairs motor coordination, balance, and protective
  reflexes, increasing vulnerability to head injuries during violent confrontations'
- 'Step 2: Intoxicated individuals are more likely to fall or be unable to protect
  themselves during assault, resulting in direct head trauma'
- 'Step 3: Head injuries were the most common injury type in the violence group, requiring
  significantly more surgical wound care'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol intoxication complicates clinical assessment because mental status
  changes may be attributed to intoxication rather than brain injury, potentially
  delaying diagnosis and treatment'
