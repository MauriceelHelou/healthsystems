to_node:
  node_id: neuroinflammatory_amplification
  node_name: Neuroinflammatory Process Amplification
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Morphine administration in context of peripheral nerve injury interacts
  with ongoing inflammatory processes'
- 'Step 2: Rather than suppressing inflammation, morphine amplifies neuroinflammatory
  processes put into motion by nerve injury'
- 'Step 3: Amplified inflammation fails to restore function in nerve-injured animals
  (CCI rats show no improvement in running behavior)'
- 'Step 4: Effect is apparent only in sham rats where neuroinflammatory cascade is
  not already activated by injury'
