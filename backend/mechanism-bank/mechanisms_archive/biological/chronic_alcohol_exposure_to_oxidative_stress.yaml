to_node:
  node_id: oxidative_stress
  node_name: Oxidative Stress
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure and subsequent withdrawal lead to generation of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS)'
- 'Step 2: Elevated ROS production manifests as increased active products of thiobarbituric
  acid, diene conjugates, and 8-isoprostane'
- 'Step 3: Antioxidant system (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase)
  becomes depleted and insufficient'
- 'Step 4: Imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants results in oxidative stress
  with damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids'

moderators:
- name: polytrauma_presence
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Combined polytrauma with alcohol withdrawal syndrome results in more
    pronounced oxidative stress compared to either condition alone, as polytrauma
    independently generates oxidative stress that compounds alcohol-related effects
- name: time_since_admission
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Measurements on day 7 showed ongoing oxidative stress despite therapy,
    suggesting persistent pathology but potential moderation with appropriate treatment
