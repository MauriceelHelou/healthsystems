mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of internalizing problems (depression, anxiety) creates
  genetic and environmental predisposition in offspring'
- 'Step 2: This familial liability manifests as behavioral characteristics captured
  in the Transmissible Liability Index (TLI)'
- 'Step 3: These behavioral characteristics mediate the relationship between family
  psychopathology and adolescent risk behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Adolescents with higher TLI scores exhibit earlier alcohol initiation and
  increased alcohol use and problems during transition to college'
