direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inflammatory processes in the lungs create a pro-inflammatory microenvironment'
- 'Step 2: Activated neutrophils and inflammatory mediators accumulate in lung tissues'
- 'Step 3: The inflammatory milieu provides favorable conditions for cancer cell seeding
  and growth'
- 'Step 4: Pro-metastatic processes are enhanced, accelerating cancer spread to lungs'
