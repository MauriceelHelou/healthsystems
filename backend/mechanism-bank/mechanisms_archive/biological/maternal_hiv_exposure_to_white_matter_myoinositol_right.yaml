direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal HIV exposure affects bilateral white matter development through
  inflammatory mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Right hemisphere white matter tracts undergo critical development during
  prenatal and early postnatal periods'
- 'Step 3: Persistent glial activation in response to prenatal inflammatory exposure
  manifests as elevated myo-inositol'
- 'Step 4: Right parietal white matter shows highly significant elevation in myo-inositol
  ratios in exposed children'
