direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts development of brain regions supporting
  language processing and verbal learning'
- 'Step 2: Altered neural connectivity affects acquisition and consolidation of verbal
  knowledge'
- 'Step 3: Specific impairments in language-related neural networks manifest as vocabulary
  deficits'
- 'Step 4: Reduced vocabulary subtest scores in adolescence/young adulthood reflect
  crystallized verbal knowledge impairment'
