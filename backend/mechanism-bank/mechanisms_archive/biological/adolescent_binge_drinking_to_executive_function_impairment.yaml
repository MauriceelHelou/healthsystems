to_node:
  node_id: executive_function_impairment
  node_name: Executive Function Impairment
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking pattern involves alternating episodes of heavy alcohol consumption
  in short intervals with periods of abstinence during critical brain development
  period'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol preferentially affects the prefrontal cortex, which provides neural
  support for executive processes during adolescence'
- 'Step 3: Repeated alcohol exposure over time may overwhelm compensatory mechanisms
  in the developing adolescent brain'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative neurotoxic effects result in measurable deficits in working
  memory, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and self-control'

  description: Executive function deficits only observed in older age group (19-22
    years) with longer consumption history, suggesting cumulative neurotoxic effects
    over time

  strength: strong
  description: Control subjects only showed better executive performance than BD subjects
    in 19-22 age range, not in younger groups (13-15, 16-18)
