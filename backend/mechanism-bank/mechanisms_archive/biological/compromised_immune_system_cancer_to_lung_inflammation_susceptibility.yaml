mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cancer and its treatments compromise the immune system function'
- 'Step 2: Immunocompromised state reduces ability to fight pathogens and control
  inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 3: Reduced immune surveillance and dysregulated immune responses increase
  vulnerability to lung infections and inflammation'
