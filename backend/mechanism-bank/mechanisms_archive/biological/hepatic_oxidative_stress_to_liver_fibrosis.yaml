  node_id: liver_fibrosis
  node_name: Hepatic Fibrosis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oxidative stress causes direct hepatocellular injury and necrosis'
- 'Step 2: Damaged hepatocytes release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)'
- 'Step 3: DAMPs activate hepatic stellate cells and promote inflammatory cell infiltration'
- 'Step 4: Activated stellate cells produce excessive collagen and extracellular matrix'
- 'Step 5: Persistent oxidative stress perpetuates chronic inflammation and progressive
  fibrosis'
