direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ASCs are administered to damaged peripheral nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: ASCs secrete trophic factors and anti-inflammatory molecules'
- 'Step 3: Schwann cell differentiation and myelination programs are restored'
- 'Step 4: Axonal myelin sheaths regenerate and peripheral nerve morphology is remodeled'
- 'Step 5: Nerve function improves as measured by sciatic functional index'
