direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lipid metabolism disorders act as initiating metabolic factors alongside
  hyperglycemia'
- 'Step 2: Abnormal lipid profiles contribute to cellular oxidative damage and mitochondrial
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Disruption of peripheral nervous system structures including nerve axons
  and glial cells'
- 'Step 4: Development of peripheral nerve dysfunction with sensory and motor symptoms'
