direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Changes in intestinal permeability allow commensal organisms to cross the
  intestinal barrier'
- 'Step 2: Commensal organisms enter the pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Entry of organisms elicits innate immune responses in the pancreas'
- 'Step 4: Innate immune responses dominate and define pancreatic inflammation'
