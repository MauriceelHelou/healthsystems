mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pubertal hormonal changes alter estrogen and testosterone levels during
  adolescence'
- 'Step 2: These hormonal fluctuations modify immune system function and response
  patterns'
- 'Step 3: Altered immune function affects pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  infection'
- 'Step 4: Compromised immune response enables bacterial dissemination beyond lungs
  to form colonies in other organs'
