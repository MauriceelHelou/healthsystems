direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Single high-dose melatonin injection (100 mg/kg) is administered following
  peripheral nerve injury'
- 'Step 2: Melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects at the cellular level through
  antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Cellular protection prevents demyelination and myelin structural breakdown'
- 'Step 4: Myelin sheath integrity is preserved compared to vehicle control, as demonstrated
  histopathologically'
