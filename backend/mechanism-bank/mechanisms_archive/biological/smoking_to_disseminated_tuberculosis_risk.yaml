- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke exposure damages pulmonary epithelial cells and impairs mucociliary
  clearance'
- 'Step 2: Smoking disrupts immune cell function including macrophages and T-cells
  in respiratory system'
- 'Step 3: Compromised local and systemic immune responses reduce ability to control
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis'
- 'Step 4: Weakened immune containment allows bacterial dissemination to extrapulmonary
  sites'
