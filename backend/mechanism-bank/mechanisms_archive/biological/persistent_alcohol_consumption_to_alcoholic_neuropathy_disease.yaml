to_node:
  node_id: alcoholic_neuropathy_disease
  node_name: Alcoholic Neuropathy Disease
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persistent alcohol imbibing initiates multiple pathogenic pathways in the
  nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure triggers nerve damage through receptor downregulation
  and direct neurotoxic effects'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative damage evolves into the clinical entity of alcoholic neuropathy'
- 'Step 4: Disease progression is mediated through purinergic and orexinergic receptor
  dysfunction'
