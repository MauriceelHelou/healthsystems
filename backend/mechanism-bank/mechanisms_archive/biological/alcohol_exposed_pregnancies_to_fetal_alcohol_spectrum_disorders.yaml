direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure occurs when pregnant women consume alcohol, allowing
  ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde to cross the placental barrier'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts fetal cellular development, particularly affecting neural
  crest cell migration, brain development, and organ formation during critical developmental
  windows'
- 'Step 3: Teratogenic effects of alcohol exposure cause permanent structural abnormalities
  (birth defects), neurodevelopmental impairments (developmental disabilities), and
  cognitive deficits (learning disabilities)'
- 'Step 4: These impairments manifest as the spectrum of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
  (FASDs) with varying severity depending on exposure timing, dose, and duration'
