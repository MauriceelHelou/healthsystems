direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: In utero alcohol exposure disrupts development of attention-regulating
  brain circuits'
- 'Step 2: Structural changes occur in brain regions controlling attention and executive
  function'
- 'Step 3: Altered cerebral and regional brain volumes affect attentional processing'
- 'Step 4: Brain structure differences partially mediate attention deficit symptoms
  in middle childhood'
