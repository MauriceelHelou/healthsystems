  node_id: chronic_ethanol_intake
  node_name: Chronic Ethanol Intake
to_node:
  node_id: peripheral_neuropathy
  node_name: Peripheral Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic ethanol intake induces oxidative stress in peripheral nerve tissues
  through increased production of reactive oxygen species'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure triggers inflammatory mediator release that damages nerve
  axons and myelin sheaths'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulated metabolic processes from chronic alcohol consumption impair
  nerve cell function and regeneration'
- 'Step 4: Progressive nerve damage manifests as sensory changes in a characteristic
  ''stocking and glove'' pattern'
