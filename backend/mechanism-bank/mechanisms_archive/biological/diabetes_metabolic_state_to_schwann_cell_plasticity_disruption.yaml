direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Diabetes creates a hyperglycemic metabolic environment that affects peripheral
  nervous system cells'
- 'Step 2: The diabetic metabolic state induces changes in Schwann cell phenotype
  and function through altered cellular signaling'
- 'Step 3: Schwann cell plasticity becomes dysregulated, compromising their normal
  roles in neurodevelopment and nerve maintenance'
- 'Step 4: Loss of normal Schwann cell plasticity impairs their ability to support
  neuronal function and regeneration'
