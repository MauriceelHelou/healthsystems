to_node:
  node_id: thiamine_deficiency
  node_name: Thiamine Deficiency
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption impairs thiamine absorption in the gastrointestinal
  tract'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts thiamine phosphorylation and storage in the liver'
- 'Step 3: Reduced dietary intake in persons with alcohol use disorder further depletes
  thiamine reserves'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative depletion leads to systemic thiamine deficiency'
