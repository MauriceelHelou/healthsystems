  node_id: hypertension
  node_name: Hypertension
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Highest PHR quartile represents most severe combination of elevated platelet
  counts and low HDL-C'
- 'Step 2: Severe metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation creates maximal endothelial
  dysfunction and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Sustained vascular inflammation and reduced vascular compliance establish
  chronic hypertensive state'
- 'Step 4: Hypertension risk more than doubles compared to lowest PHR quartile'
