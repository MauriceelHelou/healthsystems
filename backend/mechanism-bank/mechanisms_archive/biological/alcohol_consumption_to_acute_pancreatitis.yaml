  node_id: acute_pancreatitis
  node_name: Acute Pancreatitis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure creates toxic metabolites that damage pancreatic acinar
  cells'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts digestive enzyme secretion and promotes premature enzyme
  activation within the pancreas'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory cascade is triggered leading to pancreatic tissue damage'
- 'Step 4: Acute pancreatitis develops with higher rates observed in males due to
  differential exposure patterns and biological susceptibility'
