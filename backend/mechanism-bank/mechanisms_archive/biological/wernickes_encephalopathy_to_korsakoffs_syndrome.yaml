direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Untreated or inadequately treated Wernicke''s Encephalopathy leads to permanent
  damage in neural networks'
- 'Step 2: Chronic thiamine deficiency causes irreversible neuronal loss and gliosis
  in memory-related brain structures'
- 'Step 3: Damage to mammillary bodies and thalamic nuclei disrupts memory consolidation
  pathways'
- 'Step 4: Persistent cognitive deficits emerge as Korsakoff''s Syndrome, characterized
  by anterograde and retrograde amnesia'
