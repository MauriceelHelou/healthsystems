mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Activated mast cells release reactive oxygen species and inflammatory mediators'
- 'Step 2: Mast cell activation suppresses Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway'
- 'Step 3: Reduced Nrf2/HO-1 activity decreases hepatic GSH, GSH-Px, and GR levels'
- 'Step 4: Diminished antioxidant capacity results in accumulated oxidative stress
  and hepatocellular damage'
