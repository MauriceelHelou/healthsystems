direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption directly impairs immune system function through multiple
  biological pathways'
- 'Step 2: Immune dysfunction is compounded by structural factors that limit awareness
  of alcohol''s immunological effects'
- 'Step 3: Low awareness among both people with and without HIV prevents protective
  behavioral modifications'
