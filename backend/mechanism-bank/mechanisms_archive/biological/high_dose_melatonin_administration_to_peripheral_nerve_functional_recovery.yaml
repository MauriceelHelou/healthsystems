direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Single high-dose melatonin injection preserves myelin sheath and prevents
  axonal loss at the cellular level'
- 'Step 2: Preserved neural architecture allows for improved nerve conduction and
  signal transmission'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced nerve conduction manifests as higher amplitude and field values
  on electrophysiological testing (ENMG)'
- 'Step 4: Improved electrophysiological function translates to accelerated functional
  recovery as measured by sciatic nerve functional index (SFI) at days 7, 14, and
  21'
