direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: M2b monocytes produce immunoregulatory cytokines that suppress antimicrobial
  immune responses'
- 'Step 2: These cells impair pathogen recognition and clearance mechanisms in innate
  immunity'
- 'Step 3: Compromised immune surveillance allows opportunistic pathogens to establish
  infection'
- 'Step 4: Reduced capacity to mount effective inflammatory responses against microbial
  challenges'
