direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic susceptibilities (including PRSS1 mutations and other germline
  variations) create baseline vulnerability in pancreatic protease/antiprotease systems'
- 'Step 2: Environmental toxins including tobacco and alcohol exposure add cumulative
  damage to already vulnerable pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Multiple or accumulating risk factors interact synergistically rather than
  additively'
- 'Step 4: Combined genetic and environmental burden exceeds compensatory mechanisms,
  triggering disease onset along the acute-chronic pancreatitis continuum'
