direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine deficiency disrupts glucose metabolism and energy production in
  neurons, particularly in the thalamus, mammillary bodies, and cerebellum'
- 'Step 2: Neuronal dysfunction leads to Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome characterized
  by delirium, memory impairment, cerebellar dysfunction, and oculomotor abnormalities'
- 'Step 3: Accumulation of neurological damage manifests as measurable deficits in
  cognitive assessment scores and coordination'
- 'Step 4: Without treatment, progressive thiamine deficiency causes permanent structural
  brain damage and persistent neurocognitive deficits'
