  node_name: Accelerated Liver Damage
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women experience enhanced hepatotoxic effects from alcohol due to biological
  sex differences including lower gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity, smaller
  liver size, and higher body fat percentage'
- 'Step 2: These factors result in higher blood alcohol concentrations and prolonged
  alcohol exposure per drink consumed'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced hepatotoxic exposure accelerates progression of alcohol-related
  liver injury at lower consumption levels compared to men'
- 'Step 4: This results in accelerated liver damage and worsened liver-related mortality
  in women compared to men at equivalent alcohol intake'
