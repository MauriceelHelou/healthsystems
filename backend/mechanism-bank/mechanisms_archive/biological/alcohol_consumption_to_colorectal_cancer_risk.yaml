direction: positive

- 'Step 1: Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen that accumulates
  in colorectal tissue'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde damages DNA and interferes with DNA methylation patterns in
  colonocytes'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol increases intestinal permeability and alters gut microbiome composition,
  promoting chronic inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation and accumulated genetic damage increase risk of adenoma
  formation and progression to colorectal cancer'
