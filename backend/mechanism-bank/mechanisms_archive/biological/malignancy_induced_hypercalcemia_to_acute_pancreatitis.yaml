direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Malignancies (multiple myeloma, rectal cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma)
  produce parathyroid hormone-related peptides or direct bone metastases leading to
  elevated serum calcium'
- 'Step 2: Hypercalcemia causes increased calcium deposition in pancreatic ducts and
  premature activation of pancreatic enzymes'
- 'Step 3: Elevated calcium activates trypsinogen to trypsin within pancreatic acinar
  cells, triggering autodigestion'
- 'Step 4: Pancreatic inflammation and necrosis develop, manifesting as acute pancreatitis'
