direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Continued alcohol consumption causes ongoing hepatotoxic injury and inflammation
  in liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: Persistent alcohol exposure prevents liver regeneration and healing even
  with medical therapies'
- 'Step 3: Progressive liver damage leads to worsening fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatic
  decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Poor long-term outcomes occur across the entire disease spectrum despite
  availability of effective medical therapies'
