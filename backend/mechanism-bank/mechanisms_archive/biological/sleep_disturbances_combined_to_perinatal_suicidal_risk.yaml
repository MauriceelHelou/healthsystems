direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Any form of sleep disturbance (insomnia or poor sleep quality) disrupts
  critical neurobiological recovery processes during the peripartum period'
- 'Step 2: Sleep disruption impairs neurocognitive function, emotional regulation,
  and stress resilience'
- 'Step 3: Biological vulnerability interacts with psychosocial stressors unique to
  the perinatal period'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effects increase risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors across
  the perinatal continuum'
