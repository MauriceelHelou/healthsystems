direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Spleen and stomach Qi dysfunction impairs gastrointestinal function and
  disrupts normal digestive processes'
- 'Step 2: Gastrointestinal dysfunction alters neurotransmitter regulation, reducing
  serum levels of 5-HT, 5-HIAA, NE, and DA'
- 'Step 3: Decreased neurotransmitter levels disrupt sleep-wake cycle regulation and
  circadian rhythm maintenance'
- 'Step 4: Dysregulated neurotransmitter systems increase insomnia occurrence, type
  variability, and severity as measured by PSQI scores'
