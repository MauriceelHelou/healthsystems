  node_id: benign_disease_course
  node_name: Relatively Benign Disease Course
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IMP represents inflammatory rather than malignant tissue transformation
  in context of chronic pancreatitis'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory masses maintain relatively stable growth patterns without
  aggressive metastatic potential'
- 'Step 3: Complications (biliary obstruction, portal vein thrombosis, gastric outlet
  obstruction) occur at moderate rates but are manageable'
- 'Step 4: High survival rates achieved with conservative management and selective
  surgical intervention'
