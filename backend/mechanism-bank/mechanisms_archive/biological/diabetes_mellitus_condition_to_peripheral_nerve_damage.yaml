direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Streptozotocin/high-fat diet induces diabetic metabolic state'
- 'Step 2: Hyperglycemic and metabolic dysregulation damages peripheral nerve fibers'
- 'Step 3: Reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density (8.46±1.98 fibers/mm in
  untreated DM)'
- 'Step 4: Altered sensory thresholds to mechanical and heat stimuli'
- 'Step 5: Degradation of sciatic nerve morphology including axonal and myelin damage'
