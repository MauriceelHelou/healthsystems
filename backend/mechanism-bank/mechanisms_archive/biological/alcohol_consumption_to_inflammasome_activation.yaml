to_node:
  node_id: inflammasome_activation
  node_name: Inflammasome Activation and Pyroptosis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption contributes to intestinal dysbiosis and increased gut
  permeability'
- 'Step 2: Translocation of Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial components across
  compromised intestinal barrier'
- 'Step 3: Pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α (elevated by alcohol exposure)
  trigger pyroptosis process'
- 'Step 4: Macrophages produce IL-1β and IL-18 which activate the inflammasome via
  NLRC4 pathway'
- 'Step 5: Inflammasome activation leads to pyroptotic cell death of thyroid cells'
