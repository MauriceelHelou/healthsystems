- 'Step 1: Acute esophageal necrosis causes severe mucosal damage with risk of complications'
- 'Step 2: Complications include perforation, stricture formation, and progression
  of necrosis'
- 'Step 3: High mortality results from combined effects of AEN complications, underlying
  comorbidities (cirrhosis), and post-cardiac arrest syndrome'
