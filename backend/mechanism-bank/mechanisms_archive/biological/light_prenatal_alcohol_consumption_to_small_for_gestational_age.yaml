direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-level alcohol exposure crosses the placenta and enters fetal circulation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol interferes with placental nutrient transfer and oxygen delivery
  to the developing fetus'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure disrupts fetal cellular growth and development processes'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effects result in reduced fetal growth velocity and lower birth
  weight relative to gestational age'
