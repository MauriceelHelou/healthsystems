direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains toxic compounds that promote oxidative stress and
  inflammatory responses in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Chronic smoking contributes to development and progression of chronic pancreatitis
  through direct toxic effects and vascular compromise'
- 'Step 3: Progressive pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis lead to loss of functional
  tissue and measurable pancreatic atrophy'
