to_node:
  node_id: trypsinogen_activation
  node_name: Intra-acinar Trypsinogen Activation
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol excess triggers stress and injury in pancreatic acinar cells'
- 'Step 2: Acinar cell stress leads to premature/inappropriate trypsinogen activation
  within cells'
- 'Step 3: Trypsinogen activation occurs in experimental models of acute and chronic
  pancreatitis'
- 'Step 4: However, trypsin acts as a mediator rather than primary culprit in disease
  pathogenesis'
