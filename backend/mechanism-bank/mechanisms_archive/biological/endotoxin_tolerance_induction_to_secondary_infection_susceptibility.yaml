  node_name: Secondary Infection Susceptibility
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Endotoxin tolerance is induced in myeloid cells following initial immune
  challenge'
- 'Step 2: Tolerance creates an immunosuppressive state with significantly reduced
  inflammatory capacity in innate immune cells'
- 'Step 3: Reduced inflammatory capacity impairs the ability to mount effective immune
  responses'
- 'Step 4: Impaired immune function leads to increased susceptibility to subsequent
  infections'
