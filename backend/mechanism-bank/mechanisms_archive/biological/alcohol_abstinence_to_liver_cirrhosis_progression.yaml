mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Abstinence from alcohol eliminates ongoing hepatotoxic exposure and metabolic
  stress on liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: Removal of inflammatory stimulus allows hepatic regeneration and halts
  further fibrotic progression'
- 'Step 3: Cessation of alcohol consumption reduces risk of acute-on-chronic liver
  failure events and decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Sustained abstinence improves eligibility for life-saving interventions
  including liver transplantation'
