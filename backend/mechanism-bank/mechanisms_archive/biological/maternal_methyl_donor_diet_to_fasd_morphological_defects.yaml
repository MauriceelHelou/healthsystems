direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal diet supplemented with methyl donors (folic acid, choline, betaine,
  vitamin B12) prior to conception and throughout gestation provides epigenetic substrates'
- 'Step 2: Methyl donor nutrients support one-carbon metabolism and methylation processes
  critical for normal embryonic development'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced availability of methyl donors protects against alcohol-induced
  disruptions to developmental programming'
- 'Step 4: Protective effects reduce incidence and severity of alcohol-induced morphological
  defects without altering DNA methylation of imprinting control regions'
