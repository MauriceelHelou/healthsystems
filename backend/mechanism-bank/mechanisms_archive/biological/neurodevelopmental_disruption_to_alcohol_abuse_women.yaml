direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Impaired neurodevelopment results in dysregulated stress response systems
  and compromised emotion regulation capacities'
- 'Step 2: Mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, PTSD) create chronic psychological
  distress and impaired coping abilities'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol provides temporary relief from distress through neurochemical effects
  on reward and stress pathways'
- 'Step 4: Dysregulated stress systems and reward circuitry increase vulnerability
  to developing alcohol dependence and abuse patterns'
