direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregaming behavior produces elevated blood alcohol concentrations before
  students attend main social events'
- 'Step 2: High blood alcohol levels impair judgment, coordination, and decision-making
  capacity'
- 'Step 3: Physiological impairment from elevated BAC increases risk of injuries,
  accidents, violence, and other negative health consequences'
