to_node:
  node_id: hypertensive_urgency_emergency
  node_name: Hypertensive Urgency or Emergency
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hypertension during alcohol withdrawal remains untreated or inadequately
  managed due to lack of recognition or access to care'
- 'Step 2: Sustained elevated blood pressure exceeds compensatory mechanisms and autoregulatory
  capacity of vascular beds'
- 'Step 3: Severe hypertension (urgency) develops or progresses to end-organ damage
  (emergency) affecting brain, heart, kidneys, or other organs'
- 'Step 4: Hypertensive emergency manifests with acute end-organ dysfunction requiring
  immediate intervention'
