  node_name: Neuropathic Pain and Quality of Life Impairment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peripheral nerve damage disrupts normal nerve structure and function'
- 'Step 2: Demyelination and axonal damage lead to aberrant pain signaling'
- 'Step 3: Chronic neuropathic pain develops that is difficult to treat'
- 'Step 4: Pain significantly impairs quality of life and functional capacity'
- 'Step 5: Direct and indirect medical costs accumulate from chronic pain management
  needs'
