description: Paternal overweight before conception creates metabolic-driven epigenetic changes in sperm
  that reduce lung function in offspring through intergenerational programming effects.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism reflects how food environments and economic constraints shape body
    weight, which then affects intergenerational health. Overweight results from structural factors including
    food deserts, time poverty, and built environments that discourage physical activity. Equity implication:
    Communities with limited access to healthy food and safe physical activity spaces experience higher
    rates of overweight and subsequent intergenerational respiratory impacts.'
