direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pathogen infection triggers immune response in adipose tissue'
- 'Step 2: Infection acts as metabolic trigger increasing adipocyte cell number and
  size'
- 'Step 3: Altered adipocyte metabolism and adipokine release patterns occur'
- 'Step 4: Sustained adipose tissue expansion contributes to obesity development'
