direction: neutral
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Approximately 60% of individuals with severe MDD or bipolar depression
  in this sample had comorbid alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Despite high prevalence of AUD, intranasal ketamine produced significant
  anti-fatigue effects across the full sample'
- 'Step 3: The group x time interaction for fatigue reduction did not differ based
  on AUD comorbidity status'
- 'Step 4: This suggests glutamatergic modulation by ketamine addresses fatigue mechanisms
  independent of alcohol-related neurobiological alterations'
