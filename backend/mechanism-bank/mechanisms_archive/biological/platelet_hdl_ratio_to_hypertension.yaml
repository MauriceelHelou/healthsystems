  node_id: platelet_hdl_ratio
  node_name: Platelet to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio (PHR)
to_node:
  node_id: hypertension
  node_name: Hypertension
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated platelet counts indicate increased inflammatory response and platelet
  activation, while low HDL-C reflects metabolic dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Combined PHR elevation signals concurrent inflammatory and metabolic pathways
  that promote endothelial dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation impair nitric oxide production
  and increase vascular resistance'
- 'Step 4: Increased vascular resistance and reduced vascular compliance lead to elevated
  blood pressure and hypertension'

  strength: strong
  description: When PHR is below 280, the risk of hypertension increases proportionally
    with PHR, suggesting a dose-response relationship up to this threshold

  strength: moderate
  description: Analysis adjusted for race as a covariate, suggesting potential differential
    effects by racial/ethnic groups

  strength: moderate
  description: Family Poverty Income Ratio (PIR) and education level were adjusted
    as covariates, indicating potential modification by socioeconomic factors
