- 'Step 1: TNF inhibitors dampen the innate immune response by blocking tumor necrosis
  factor pathways'
- 'Step 2: Reduced innate immunity increases susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens
  and reactivation of latent infections'
- 'Step 3: Mycobacterium tuberculosis exploits the immunosuppressed state, with TNF
  inhibitor recipients showing 12.5-59% of all infections attributed to M. tuberculosis'
