direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis indicates pre-existing alcohol exposure
  pattern and pancreatic vulnerability to alcohol toxicity'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol etiology suggests ongoing alcohol use disorder requiring structural
  intervention'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol exposure in susceptible pancreas perpetuates inflammatory
  cascade and prevents healing'
- 'Step 4: Persistent inflammation transitions to chronic pancreatitis through fibrotic
  remodeling'
