mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic ethanol intake disrupts cellular energy metabolism and nutrient
  processing in nerve cells'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic dysregulation impairs protein synthesis and cellular repair mechanisms
  in neurons and Schwann cells'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated metabolic dysfunction compromises nerve cell viability and
  axonal transport'
- 'Step 4: Progressive metabolic failure leads to nerve degeneration and neuropathic
  symptoms'
