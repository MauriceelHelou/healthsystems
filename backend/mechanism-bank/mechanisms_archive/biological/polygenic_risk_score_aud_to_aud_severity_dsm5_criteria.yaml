direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher polygenic risk scores reflect cumulative genetic variants associated
  with alcohol-related traits and neurobiological vulnerability'
- 'Step 2: Genetic predisposition influences both likelihood of developing AUD and
  progression to more severe presentations'
- 'Step 3: PRS shows dose-response relationship with number of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria
  met, indicating genetic influence on disorder severity'
- 'Step 4: Association persists after controlling for family history, suggesting distinct
  genetic architecture for AUD severity'
