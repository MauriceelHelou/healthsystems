direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol exposure during pregnancy (particularly around conception)
  enters maternal circulation and crosses placental barrier'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure triggers immune response in placental tissue'
- 'Step 3: Increased recruitment or proliferation of Hofbauer cells (fetal placental
  villi macrophages) occurs in response to alcohol-induced tissue stress'
- 'Step 4: Higher proportion of Hofbauer cells reflects altered placental immune microenvironment'
