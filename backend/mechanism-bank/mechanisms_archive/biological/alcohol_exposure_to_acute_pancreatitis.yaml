- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure causes pancreatic duct and exocrine acinar injury'
- 'Step 2: Pancreatic injury leads to improper secretion of digestive enzymes'
- 'Step 3: Digestive enzymes cause auto-digestion of pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 4: Auto-digestion triggers severe inflammatory response resulting in acute
  pancreatitis'
