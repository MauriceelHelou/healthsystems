  node_id: mast_cell_recruitment
  node_name: Hepatic Mast Cell Recruitment and Activation
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chemical toxin exposure (CCl4) causes direct hepatocellular injury'
- 'Step 2: Hepatic injury triggers release of chemotactic factors including SCF (stem
  cell factor)'
- 'Step 3: SCF binds to c-kit receptors, promoting mast cell recruitment to liver
  tissue'
- 'Step 4: Recruited mast cells become activated in the inflammatory hepatic microenvironment'
