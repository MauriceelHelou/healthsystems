  node_id: peripheral_neuropathy
  node_name: Peripheral Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol overconsumption leads to direct neurotoxic effects on peripheral
  nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism produces toxic metabolites that damage both large and
  small nerve fibers'
- 'Step 3: Nerve damage manifests as measurable peripheral neuropathy detectable through
  clinical scales'
- 'Step 4: Large fiber neuropathy and small fiber neuropathy develop with distinct
  clinical presentations'

  description: Clinical scales showed stronger correlation with large fiber neuropathy
    (LFN) than small fiber neuropathy (SFN), except for NSS which was more sensitive
    to SFN
