  node_id: alcohol_withdrawal_severity
  node_name: Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome Severity
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher blood PEth concentrations reflect greater cumulative alcohol exposure
  and chronic heavy drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol exposure leads to neuroadaptive changes including upregulation
  of excitatory neurotransmitter systems and downregulation of inhibitory systems'
- 'Step 3: Upon cessation of alcohol, the imbalance in neurotransmitter systems produces
  more severe physiological and psychological withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 4: PEth levels measured at admission predict the magnitude of withdrawal symptoms
  throughout detoxification'
