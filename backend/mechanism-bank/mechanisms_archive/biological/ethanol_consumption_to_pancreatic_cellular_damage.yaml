direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ethanol exposure directly contacts pancreatic acinar cells, ductal epithelium,
  and stellate cells'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol induces oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in pancreatic
  tissue'
- 'Step 3: Cellular damage occurs to multiple pancreatic cell types including acinar
  cells, ductal epithelium, and pancreatic stellate cells'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative cellular damage impairs pancreatic structure and function'
