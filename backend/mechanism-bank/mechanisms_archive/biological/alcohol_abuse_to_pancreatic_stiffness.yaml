  node_name: Pancreatic Stiffness (Shear Wave Velocity)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes direct toxic injury to pancreatic acinar
  cells and promotes inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Repeated inflammatory episodes lead to progressive fibrosis and deposition
  of extracellular matrix in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Fibrotic changes increase tissue stiffness, measurable as elevated shear
  wave velocity on elastography'
- 'Step 4: Increased pancreatic stiffness reflects underlying chronic pancreatitis
  pathology'
