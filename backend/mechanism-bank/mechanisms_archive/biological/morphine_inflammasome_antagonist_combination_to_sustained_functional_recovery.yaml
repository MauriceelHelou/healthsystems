direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Combined therapy with morphine plus TLR4 antagonist ((+)-naloxone) or P2X7
  antagonist (A438079) delivered systemically'
- 'Step 2: Antagonists block critical receptors for NLRP3 inflammasome activation,
  suppressing inflammatory damage at multiple sites (injured sciatic nerve, dorsal
  root ganglia, spinal cord, potentially higher levels)'
- 'Step 3: Systemic administration enables intervention across neuraxis rather than
  single site (as with intrathecal delivery), providing more comprehensive anti-inflammatory
  effects'
- 'Step 4: Brief treatment course produces rapid and persistent return of nerve-injured
  animals to sham levels of voluntary physical activity, lasting 5+ weeks after dosing
  cessation'
