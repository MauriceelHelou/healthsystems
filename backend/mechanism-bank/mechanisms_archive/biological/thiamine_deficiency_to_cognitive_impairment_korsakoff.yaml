direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine deficiency disrupts glucose metabolism in neurons, particularly
  affecting mammillary bodies, thalamus, and periventricular regions'
- 'Step 2: Initial acute Wernicke''s encephalopathy develops with confusional state,
  ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia'
- 'Step 3: Without immediate high-dose thiamine replacement, acute encephalopathy
  progresses to structural brain damage'
- 'Step 4: Permanent neuronal loss in memory circuits leads to Korsakoff psychosis
  with irreversible anterograde amnesia, confabulation, and cognitive deficits'
