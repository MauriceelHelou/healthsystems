  node_name: Lifetime Amount of Smoking
to_node:
  node_id: rectal_cancer_incidence
  node_name: Rectal Cancer Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predisposition to higher lifetime smoking increases cumulative
  carcinogen exposure'
- 'Step 2: Tobacco carcinogens reach rectal tissue through systemic circulation and
  potentially through direct contact'
- 'Step 3: Carcinogenic compounds induce mutations in rectal epithelial cells'
- 'Step 4: Progressive accumulation of mutations leads to neoplastic transformation
  and rectal carcinoma development'
