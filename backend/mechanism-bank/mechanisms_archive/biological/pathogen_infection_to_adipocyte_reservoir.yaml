direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pathogens infect and colonize adipose tissue cells'
- 'Step 2: Adipocytes serve as cellular reservoirs for pathogen replication and persistence'
- 'Step 3: Adipocytes play active role in harboring pathogens rather than passive
  storage'
- 'Step 4: Pathogen persistence in adipose tissue contributes to chronic infection
