  node_name: Binge Drinking Pattern (vs Regular Consumption)
to_node:
  node_id: prefrontal_cortex_damage
  node_name: Prefrontal Cortex Alterations
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking pattern involves alternating heavy consumption episodes
  with abstinence periods, creating cyclical peaks of high blood alcohol concentration'
- 'Step 2: This intermittent exposure pattern produces more severe neurotoxic stress
  on developing prefrontal cortex compared to steady regular consumption'
- 'Step 3: Prefrontal cortex undergoes critical development during adolescence and
  is particularly vulnerable to alcohol-induced structural and functional alterations'
- 'Step 4: Binge pattern-specific damage results in more pronounced impairment of
  prefrontal-dependent executive functions than regular drinking patterns'
