- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during pregnancy affects placental function and nutrient
  transfer'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts fetal growth patterns and organ development'
- 'Step 3: These disruptions manifest as adverse outcomes during the perinatal period
  including preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth'
- 'Step 4: Timing and dose of exposure influence severity and type of adverse outcomes'
