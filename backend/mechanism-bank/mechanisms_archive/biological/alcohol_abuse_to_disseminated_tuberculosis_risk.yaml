- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption impairs immune system function and cellular
  immunity'
- 'Step 2: Compromised immune response reduces ability to contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  infection within lungs'
- 'Step 3: Weakened immune surveillance allows bacterial dissemination through lymphatic
  and hematogenous routes'
- 'Step 4: Bacteria establish colonies in extrapulmonary sites leading to disseminated
  tuberculosis'
