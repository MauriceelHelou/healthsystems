  node_id: deficient_brain_growth
  node_name: Deficient Brain Growth
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ethanol crosses blood-brain barrier and interferes with neuronal proliferation,
  migration, and differentiation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts neurotrophic factor signaling and induces oxidative stress
  in developing brain tissue'
- 'Step 3: Cell death and impaired synaptogenesis result in reduced brain volume and
  structural abnormalities'
- 'Step 4: Deficient brain growth manifests as microcephaly or structural brain malformations'
