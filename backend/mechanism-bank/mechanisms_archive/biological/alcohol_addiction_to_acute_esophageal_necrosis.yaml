  node_name: Acute Esophageal Necrosis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use damages gastric and esophageal mucosa through direct
  toxic effects'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol increases gastric acid production and impairs lower esophageal
  sphincter function'
- 'Step 3: Severe gastroesophageal reflux exposes esophageal tissue to corrosive gastric
  contents'
- 'Step 4: Combined with vascular compromise from other comorbidities, severe reflux
  injury progresses to ischemic necrosis'
