direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Metformin administration in diabetic conditions modulates metabolic pathways
  affecting nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: Preserved intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) compared to untreated
  diabetes'
- 'Step 3: Structural preservation of nerve fibers prevents progression of diabetic
  peripheral neuropathy'
- 'Step 4: Improved sensory thresholds to mechanical and heat stimuli'
