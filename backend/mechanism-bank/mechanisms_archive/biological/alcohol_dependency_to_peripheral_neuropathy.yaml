to_node:
  node_id: peripheral_neuropathy
  node_name: Peripheral Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol overconsumption leads to toxic metabolite accumulation
  affecting nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol and its metabolites cause direct neurotoxic damage to peripheral
  nerve fibers'
- 'Step 3: Both large and small nerve fibers undergo structural degeneration, with
  small fibers particularly vulnerable'
- 'Step 4: Progressive nerve fiber damage results in clinical peripheral neuropathy
  with sensory impairment'
