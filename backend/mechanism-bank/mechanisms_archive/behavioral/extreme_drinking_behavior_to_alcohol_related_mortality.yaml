  node_id: alcohol_related_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Mortality
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extreme drinking episodes (high-volume alcohol consumption) produce acute
  physiological stress including respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and
  impaired motor function'
- 'Step 2: Acute intoxication increases risk of fatal injuries through motor vehicle
  crashes, falls, drowning, and violence'
- 'Step 3: Repeated extreme drinking episodes accumulate organ damage, particularly
  to liver, cardiovascular system, and brain'
- 'Step 4: Combined acute and chronic effects of extreme drinking translate to elevated
  mortality risk'

  description: The pathway from extreme drinking to mortality appears stronger in
    young men, possibly due to higher baseline rates of extreme drinking, greater
    risk-taking when intoxicated, or differential physiological vulnerability
