- 'Step 1: Protective behavioral strategies during drinking games include behaviors
  like alternating alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks'
- 'Step 2: These strategies directly reduce the rate and total amount of alcohol consumption
  during drinking game participation'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption reduces acute intoxication levels and associated
  impairment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced intoxication leads to fewer negative consequences such as injuries,
  blackouts, risky behaviors, and alcohol poisoning'
