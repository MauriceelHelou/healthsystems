  node_id: colorectal_cancer_risk

direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoking initiation leads to exposure to carcinogenic compounds
  that enter systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Smoking-related compounds induce epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation
  changes) in blood cells at specific CpG sites'
- 'Step 3: Altered DNA methylation patterns, particularly at sites like cg02149899,
  create pro-tumorigenic cellular environments'
- 'Step 4: These epigenetic changes accumulate over time and increase susceptibility
  to colorectal carcinogenesis'
