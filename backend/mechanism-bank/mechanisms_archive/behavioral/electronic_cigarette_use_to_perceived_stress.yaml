direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Electronic cigarette use may be initiated as a coping mechanism for managing
  stress among adolescents and young adults facing developmental challenges'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine dependence develops, creating withdrawal-related stress during
  periods without vaping and perpetuating a cycle of stress and use'
- 'Step 3: The temporary stress relief from vaping prevents development of adaptive
  stress management skills and healthy coping strategies'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated life stressors and maladaptive coping through substance use
  increase overall perceived stress levels over time'
