  node_id: sars_cov2_infection
  node_name: SARS-CoV-2 Infection
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High frequency ENDS use involves more frequent hand-to-mouth contact and
  device handling throughout the day, multiplying exposure opportunities'
- 'Step 2: Greater cumulative exposure to aerosols causes more sustained respiratory
  epithelial damage and immune dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: More frequent social interactions around vaping behavior increases exposure
  to potentially infected individuals'
- 'Step 4: Dose-dependent respiratory compromise combined with increased social contact
  elevates infection susceptibility'
