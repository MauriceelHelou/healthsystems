direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor sleep quality disrupts neurobiological regulation and stress response
  systems in individuals with insomnia'
- 'Step 2: Disrupted sleep architecture and increased physiological stress create
  conditions where alcohol use intensifies'
- 'Step 3: The interaction between chronic sleep disturbance and heavy alcohol consumption
  generates cascading problems including tolerance, dependence, and social/occupational
  consequences'
- 'Step 4: This mechanism operates more strongly in women than men, potentially due
  to sex differences in alcohol metabolism, sleep architecture, or stress physiology'

moderators:
- name: sex
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The positive association between poor sleep quality and alcohol-related
    problems is significant in women but not in men. Sex significantly moderated this
    relationship even after controlling for age, stress, and depression.
- name: depression
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Depression was controlled for in analyses, suggesting it may be a confounding
    or moderating factor in the sleep-alcohol relationship.
- name: subjective_stress
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Global subjective stress was controlled for in analyses, indicating
    it may influence the association between sleep quality and alcohol problems.
