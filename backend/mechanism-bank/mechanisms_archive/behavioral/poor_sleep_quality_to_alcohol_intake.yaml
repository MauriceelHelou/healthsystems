direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor sleep quality produces daytime fatigue, irritability, and dysfunction
  that impair daily functioning'
- 'Step 2: Individuals experiencing sleep-related impairment may use alcohol as a
  self-medication strategy to promote relaxation and sleep initiation'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol intake increases as a compensatory mechanism to manage sleep difficulties
  and associated daytime symptoms'
- 'Step 4: This creates a cyclical pattern where alcohol use may further degrade sleep
  architecture and perpetuate poor sleep quality'
