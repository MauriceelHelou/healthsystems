direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Texting while driving creates a series of visual glances between phone
  and roadway, with more than half the time spent looking at phone rather than road'
- 'Step 2: Divided visual attention reduces ability to monitor roadway position and
  respond to driving demands'
- 'Step 3: Impaired visual monitoring leads to deviation in vehicle position on roadway,
  increasing crash risk'
