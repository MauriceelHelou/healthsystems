direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption (particularly heavy/chronic use) may contribute to
  hypertension through sympathetic nervous system activation and altered vascular
  tone'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species causing
  direct myocardial and vascular damage'
- 'Step 3: Heavy alcohol use promotes dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides) and metabolic
  dysregulation'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative vascular and cardiac damage increases risk of stroke and ischemic
  heart disease'
