direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher delay discounting rates reflect neurocognitive patterns that prioritize
  immediate over delayed rewards'
- 'Step 2: During adolescence, when substance use opportunities emerge, high discounting
  rates reduce the salience of long-term health consequences'
- 'Step 3: The immediate rewarding effects of alcohol become disproportionately weighted
  in decision-making relative to delayed negative outcomes'
- 'Step 4: This cognitive-behavioral pattern increases probability of alcohol initiation
  and escalation to problematic use during peak risk period of adolescence'
