direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher mental health symptom severity (measured by GHQ-12) creates increased
  psychological distress and functional impairment'
- 'Step 2: Increased distress may lead to cognitive symptoms including hopelessness,
  withdrawal, and decreased self-efficacy'
- 'Step 3: These symptoms reduce capacity for help-seeking behaviors and increase
  avoidance of formal mental health services'
- 'Step 4: Paradoxically, those with greatest need are least likely to access mental
  health professionals'

  description: Effect was stronger in India (OR=2.20 for dichotomized GHQ≥2) compared
    to Thailand (OR=1.11 per continuous GHQ unit), suggesting cultural and healthcare
    system factors moderate this relationship
