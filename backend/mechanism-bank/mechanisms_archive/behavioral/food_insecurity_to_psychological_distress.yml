- 'Step 1: Chronic uncertainty about food availability creates persistent worry and anxiety about meeting
  basic needs'

- 'Step 3: Nutritional deficiencies from poor diet quality affect neurotransmitter synthesis and brain
  function'
- 'Step 4: Food-related stress accumulates with other poverty-related stressors, overwhelming coping capacity'
- 'Step 5: Sustained psychological distress manifests as clinical anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders'

description: Food insecurity is strongly associated with psychological distress, increasing the odds of
  distress by 229% (OR 3.29). This relationship operates through chronic stress, nutritional impacts on
  brain health, and the compounding effects of poverty-related adversity. Secondary outcomes include sleep
  problems, anxiety, depression, and lower life satisfaction.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: economic_system
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Food insecurity is a structural exposure reflecting economic inequality, not individual
    failing. The psychological distress it causes is a predictable response to material deprivation and
    systemic exclusion from food security. Policy solutions must address root causes including living
    wages, robust food assistance, and affordable housing rather than individual resilience.
assumptions:
- Assumes chronic or recurrent food insecurity exposure
- Psychological distress measured through validated scales (K6, PHQ, etc.)
- Excludes acute, temporary food shortage situations
limitations:
- Cross-sectional studies predominate, limiting causal inference
- Bidirectional relationship possible (distress may also cause food insecurity)
- Most studies from high-income countries, particularly US
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Food insecurity prevalence and associated distress vary by region, with higher rates
    in areas with limited food assistance infrastructure and high poverty concentration.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Low-income households show 2-3x higher food insecurity rates
  - Rural areas face transportation barriers to food access
  - Food deserts concentrate food access challenges
