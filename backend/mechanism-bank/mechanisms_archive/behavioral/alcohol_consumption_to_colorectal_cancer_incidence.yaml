- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption exposes colorectal tissue to ethanol and its metabolite
  acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde causes DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation in colorectal
  epithelium'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure impairs DNA repair mechanisms and promotes cellular proliferation'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations increase colorectal cancer
  incidence'
