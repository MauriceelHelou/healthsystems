direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption causes direct toxic effects on pancreatic acinar cells
  through metabolic byproducts like acetaldehyde and fatty acid ethyl esters'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure promotes inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative
  stress in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Progressive pancreatic damage leads to both acute and chronic pancreatitis
  episodes'
- 'Step 4: Pancreatitis results in premature mortality and years lived with disability,
  measured as DALYs'
