  node_id: sleep_quality
  node_name: Sleep Quality
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social media platforms are designed with engagement algorithms that create
  compulsive checking behaviors and extended usage patterns'
- 'Step 2: Addictive social media use leads to nocturnal checking, cognitive arousal
  from social comparison, and displacement of sleep time'
- 'Step 3: Combination of reduced sleep duration, delayed sleep onset, and heightened
  pre-sleep arousal results in impaired sleep quality'
- 'Step 4: Poor sleep quality may further increase vulnerability to social media addiction
  through reduced self-regulation capacity'
