direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol intoxication increases likelihood of severe laceration injuries
  involving neurovascular structures and tendons (74% of intoxicated patients)'
- 'Step 2: Laceration injuries require complex surgical repair and prolonged rehabilitation
  compared to simple fractures'
- 'Step 3: Damage to nerves and tendons results in incomplete functional recovery
  despite treatment'
- 'Step 4: Patients with laceration-type injuries demonstrate higher disability scores
  on DASH questionnaire at follow-up'
