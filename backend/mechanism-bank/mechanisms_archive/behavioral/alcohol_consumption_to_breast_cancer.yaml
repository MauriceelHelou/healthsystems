direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption increases circulating sex steroid hormone levels (estrogen
  and androgens)'
- 'Step 2: Elevated hormone levels promote proliferation of hormone-receptor positive
  breast tissue'
- 'Step 3: Acetaldehyde causes DNA damage in breast epithelial cells'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol impairs folate metabolism, reducing DNA methylation capacity and
  increasing mutation risk'
