direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Environmental cues become associated with alcohol availability through
  repeated pairing and conditioning'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-paired stimuli activate neural circuits involved in craving and
  motivated responding'
- 'Step 3: Cue-induced craving drives compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior independent
  of consumption'
- 'Step 4: Persistent cue reactivity leads to relapse even after periods of abstinence
  or when alcohol is less rewarding'
