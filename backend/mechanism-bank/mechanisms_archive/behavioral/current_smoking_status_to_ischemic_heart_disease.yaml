mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke exposure causes endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress
  in blood vessels'
- 'Step 2: Chronic smoking promotes inflammatory processes and platelet activation'
- 'Step 3: These pathological changes accelerate atherosclerotic plaque formation
  in coronary arteries'
- 'Step 4: Progressive atherosclerosis leads to reduced coronary blood flow and ischemic
  heart disease events'
