direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related visual impairment (at 0.07-0.1% BAC) reduces baseline visual
  processing capacity and coordination'
- 'Step 2: When combined with texting, alcohol impairment increases mean glance duration
  away from roadway, number of glances off road, and total duration of eyes off roadway'
- 'Step 3: Synergistic effects of alcohol and texting dramatically worsen vehicle
  control beyond either factor alone'
- 'Step 4: Severe impairment increases likelihood of crashes, injuries, and fatalities'
