direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early alcohol initiation establishes tolerance and normalization of alcohol
  consumption during adolescence'
- 'Step 2: Youth who begin drinking early develop social networks and drinking contexts
  that support high-volume consumption'
- 'Step 3: Longer drinking histories from early initiation create entrenched patterns
  of heavy episodic drinking'
- 'Step 4: These patterns persist into young adulthood as monthly or more frequent
  occasions of consuming 11+ standard drinks'
