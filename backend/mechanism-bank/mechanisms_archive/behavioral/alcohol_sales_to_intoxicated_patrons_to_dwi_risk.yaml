direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Overservice of alcohol to already intoxicated customers increases their
  blood alcohol concentration beyond legal driving limits'
- 'Step 2: Intoxicated patrons leaving licensed establishments often drive vehicles
  to return home or continue to other locations'
- 'Step 3: Elevated alcohol consumption increases impairment of motor skills, judgment,
  and reaction time necessary for safe driving'
- 'Step 4: Increased prevalence of overservice at population level elevates community-wide
  risk of DWI incidents'
