mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Major depressive disorder produces anhedonia, hopelessness, sleep disruption, and emotional
  pain'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol provides temporary mood elevation through dopaminergic reward activation and GABA-mediated
  anxiolysis'
- 'Step 3: Self-medication pattern develops as drinking becomes automatic response to depressive symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological vulnerability increases as depression and alcohol use both dysregulate stress
  and reward systems'
- 'Step 5: Escalating consumption leads to tolerance, dependence, and AUD, with depression worsening due
  to alcohol''s depressant effects'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: institutional
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: The depression-AUD pathway reflects systematic failures in mental health care access
    and structural conditions that produce depression. Communities experiencing poverty, racism, and disinvestment
    have elevated depression rates due to chronic stress and trauma exposure. These same communities face
    mental health treatment deserts, lack of insurance, and culturally incompetent care. When evidence-based
    depression treatment is inaccessible, alcohol becomes default self-medication. High co-occurrence
    in marginalized populations is not coincidental but reflects deliberate under-resourcing of community
    mental health. Interrupting this pathway requires universal mental health coverage, community-based
    culturally responsive care, and addressing structural determinants (poverty, discrimination, trauma)
    that generate depression.
assumptions:
- Depression measured by clinical diagnosis or validated screening instruments
- Self-medication hypothesis assumes drinking motivated by symptom relief
- Bidirectional relationship exists but this mechanism focuses on depression → AUD direction
limitations:
- Causal direction debated; alcohol use can also cause or worsen depression
- Many individuals with depression do not develop AUD
- Effectiveness of self-medication is transient; chronic use worsens depression
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Depression prevalence and treatment access vary substantially, shaping local depression-AUD
    pathways
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas have high depression rates and severe mental health provider shortages
  - Low-income urban neighborhoods face treatment barriers despite higher provider density
  - States with robust Medicaid mental health coverage show lower depression-AUD conversion
  - Communities with integrated primary care-behavioral health show earlier intervention
