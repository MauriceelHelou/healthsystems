direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy drinking patterns (measured by AUDIT-C) create neurobiological adaptations
  through repeated alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 2: Continued heavy consumption leads to tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, and
  altered reward processing'
- 'Step 3: However, study shows heavy drinking is necessary but not sufficient for
  AUD development'
- 'Step 4: Additional factors including genetic susceptibility, environmental stressors,
  and access to treatment determine transition from heavy drinking to clinical disorder'
