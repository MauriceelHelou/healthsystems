direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking is associated with impaired judgment and increased impulsivity
  during intoxication periods'
- 'Step 2: Students who binge drink may be more likely to keep firearms readily accessible
  or less likely to secure them properly'
- 'Step 3: Cultural and social networks that normalize binge drinking may overlap
  with communities where firearm ownership is normative'
- 'Step 4: The combination creates higher risk for violence, self-harm, and unintentional
  injury during periods of intoxication'
