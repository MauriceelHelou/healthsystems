mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-existing substance use disorder indicates vulnerability through shared genetic risk factors
  and dysregulated reward/stress neurocircuitry'
- 'Step 2: Cross-sensitization occurs where chronic drug use alters dopamine, glutamate, and stress systems
  increasing sensitivity to all substances'
- 'Step 3: Polysubstance use patterns develop as individuals seek additional substances for varied effects
  or to manage withdrawal'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol is readily accessible, legal, and socially normalized compared to controlled substances,
  facilitating transition'
- 'Step 5: Shared neural adaptations in prefrontal cortex and limbic regions impair self-regulation across
  all substances, enabling AUD development'

  equity_implications: Polysubstance use patterns reflect both neurobiological vulnerability and structural
    conditions. Communities experiencing economic distress, hopelessness, and limited opportunity show
    high rates of both initiation and progression across substances. The "diseases of despair" framework
    recognizes how structural abandonment drives overlapping epidemics of alcohol, opioids, and suicide.
    Criminal justice approaches that punish rather than treat SUD increase polysubstance use by creating
    barriers to employment, housing, and treatment. Fragmented treatment systems that address only one
    substance miss the reality of polysubstance patterns. High AUD among individuals with other SUDs reflects
    inadequate comprehensive addiction care, not individual moral failure across multiple substances.
assumptions:
- Any SUD includes opioid, stimulant, cannabis, or other substance use disorders
- Shared liability model assumes common genetic and neurobiological risk factors
- Polysubstance use is more common than single-substance use in clinical populations
limitations:
- Not all individuals with non-alcohol SUD develop AUD
- Directionality can vary (alcohol may also precede other substance use)
- Social determinants may confound the substance-to-substance relationship
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Polysubstance patterns vary by drug market availability, treatment system design, and
    overdose crisis evolution
  relevant_geographies:
  - Communities experiencing opioid crisis show high alcohol co-use and overdose risk
  - Regions with methamphetamine markets show alcohol use to manage stimulant effects
  - Areas with comprehensive SUD treatment show lower progression to polysubstance dependence
  - Criminal justice-involved populations show especially high polysubstance rates
