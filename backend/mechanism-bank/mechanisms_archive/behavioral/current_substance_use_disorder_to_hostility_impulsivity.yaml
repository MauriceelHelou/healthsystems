to_node:
  node_id: hostility_impulsivity
  node_name: Hostility and Impulsivity
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current substance use in patients with severe mental disorders alters neurotransmitter
  systems regulating emotion and impulse control'
- 'Step 2: Disrupted prefrontal cortex functioning reduces capacity for emotional
  regulation and increases reactive aggression'
- 'Step 3: Patients exhibit elevated irritability, negativism, and hostile verbal
  behaviors as measurable manifestations'
- 'Step 4: These hostility and impulsivity markers serve as proximal risk factors
  for escalation to physical violence'
