- 'Step 1: Alcohol problems impair cognitive functioning and reduce inhibitory control
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Cyber monitoring provides emotionally-salient instigatory cues through
  constant access to partner information'
- 'Step 3: The combination of impaired inhibition and access to instigatory information
  increases likelihood of psychological aggression'

  to more triggers while having reduced capacity to regulate aggressive responses'
