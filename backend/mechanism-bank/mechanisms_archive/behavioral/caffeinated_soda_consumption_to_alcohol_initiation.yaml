direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Daily caffeinated soda consumption establishes patterns of seeking psychoactive
  substance effects in preadolescence'
- 'Step 2: Caffeine exposure primes reward pathways and creates expectancies for substance-induced
  mood alteration'
- 'Step 3: Impaired impulse control and executive function reduce behavioral inhibition
  toward experimentation'
- 'Step 4: Children with caffeinated soda consumption patterns initiate alcohol sipping
  at higher rates over 12-month follow-up'

  description: The association persisted even after controlling for baseline alcohol
    sipping rates, suggesting caffeinated soda consumption has independent predictive
    value for alcohol initiation
