direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke induces chronic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses
  throughout the vascular system'
- 'Step 2: Smoking promotes endothelial dysfunction, lipid oxidation, and smooth muscle
  cell proliferation'
- 'Step 3: These processes accelerate atherosclerotic plaque formation across multiple
  vascular beds'
- 'Step 4: Progressive atherosclerosis manifests as ischemic heart disease, stroke,
  and other cardiovascular events'
