  node_name: Penetrating Trauma from Gun and Knife Violence
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Methamphetamine use alters neurochemical pathways, increasing dopamine
  and norepinephrine levels, leading to heightened arousal, aggression, and impaired
  judgment'
- 'Step 2: Stimulant effects reduce inhibition and increase risk-taking behaviors,
  making violent confrontations more likely'
- 'Step 3: Users may engage in or become targets of violence in contexts where methamphetamine
  is obtained or used'
- 'Step 4: Increased likelihood of carrying or encountering weapons (guns, knives)
  in these contexts elevates risk of penetrating trauma'
