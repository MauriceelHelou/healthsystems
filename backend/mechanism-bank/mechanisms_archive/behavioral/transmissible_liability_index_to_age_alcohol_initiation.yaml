- 'Step 1: Higher Transmissible Liability Index scores reflect inherited behavioral
  characteristics including temperament and mood patterns'
- 'Step 2: These behavioral characteristics include disinhibition, impulsivity, and
  emotional dysregulation'
- 'Step 3: Youth with these characteristics are more susceptible to peer influence
  and experimentation'
- 'Step 4: This leads to earlier initiation of alcohol use (lower age of onset)'
