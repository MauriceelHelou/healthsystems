direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social isolation and loneliness create chronic psychological distress, anxiety, and depressive
  symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Lack of meaningful social connections removes protective social monitoring and accountability
  for drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol use emerges as self-medication for emotional pain and temporary relief from loneliness'
- 'Step 4: Solitary drinking patterns develop without social brakes that typically moderate consumption
  in group settings'
- 'Step 5: Binge drinking episodes increase as coping mechanism, paradoxically worsening isolation through
  stigma and withdrawal'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: spatial_arrangement
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Social isolation is not an individual failing but a structural outcome of how communities
    are designed and resourced. Urban sprawl, car-dependent development, and lack of public third places
    create physical isolation. Economic precarity forces long work hours that prevent social engagement.
    Displacement through gentrification severs community ties. Older adults and people with disabilities
    face isolation from inaccessible built environments and defunded senior services. High isolation in
    certain populations reflects policy choices about community investment, public transportation, housing
    stability, and social infrastructure—not individual asocial tendencies. Addressing isolation-driven
    binge drinking requires redesigning communities for connection.
assumptions:
- Social isolation assessed by objective measures (living alone, infrequent contact)
- Loneliness captures subjective perception of insufficient social connection
- Mechanism operates through psychological distress and lack of behavioral constraints
limitations:
- Some isolated individuals do not increase drinking; protective factors matter
- Direction of causality may be bidirectional (heavy drinking also causes isolation)
- Cultural variation exists in social support needs and drinking as acceptable coping
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Isolation varies by built environment, community design, and availability of social
    infrastructure
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas show high isolation due to geographic dispersal and limited public gathering spaces
  - Car-dependent suburbs lack walkable third places for spontaneous social interaction
  - Urban areas with strong neighborhood cohesion and public spaces show lower isolation despite density
  - Communities with active senior centers, libraries, and community centers buffer isolation effects
