direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol at 0.05% BAC impairs psychomotor control and visual attention'
- 'Step 2: Impaired drivers show increased variability in lateral lane position control'
- 'Step 3: While lane departure frequency at 0.05% did not significantly differ from
  placebo in this study, variability in lane keeping increased'
- 'Step 4: Increased lane keeping variability creates conditions for lane departure
  events, particularly in complex urban environments'
