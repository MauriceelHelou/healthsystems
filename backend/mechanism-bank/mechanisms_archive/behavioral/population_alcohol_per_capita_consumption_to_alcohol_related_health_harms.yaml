direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Population-level mean alcohol consumption determines the overall distribution
  of individual consumption levels'
- 'Step 2: Risk of health harms increases with individual consumption levels across
  the drinking spectrum'
- 'Step 3: Most health harms arise from the majority of moderate drinkers due to their
  large population size, not just from heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 4: Higher per capita consumption increases harm rates across all drinking
  levels, producing population-level increases in health harms'
