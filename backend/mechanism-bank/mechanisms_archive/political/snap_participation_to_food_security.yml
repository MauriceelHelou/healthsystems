mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SNAP eligibility and enrollment processes connect low-income households to food benefits'
- 'Step 2: Monthly benefits increase household food purchasing power and reduce food insecurity'
- 'Step 3: Reduced food insecurity decreases need to sacrifice healthcare spending for food'
- 'Step 4: Adequate nutrition supports chronic disease management and medication adherence'
- 'Step 5: Improved nutritional status leads to better self-reported health and reduced healthcare utilization'

description: SNAP is the nation's largest anti-hunger program, providing food benefits to approximately 42 million people. Research demonstrates SNAP significantly reduces food insecurity and improves health outcomes including better self-reported health, lower risk of heart disease and obesity among adults who had childhood access, and greater medication adherence among older participants. Early childhood exposure produces particularly strong long-term health effects.

  equity_implications: SNAP serves as critical safety net infrastructure addressing structural causes of food insecurity (unemployment, low wages, high housing costs). Benefit adequacy, not individual food choices, is the primary policy lever. Administrative barriers and work requirements can exclude vulnerable populations. Policy should focus on benefit levels, enrollment simplification, and integration with healthcare.
assumptions:
- SNAP participation includes regular monthly benefits
- Food security measured by USDA Food Security Survey Module
- Health outcomes include self-reported health, chronic disease, and healthcare utilization
limitations:
- Randomized trials ethically infeasible; causal estimates rely on quasi-experimental designs
- Some research shows SNAP participants have lower dietary quality than eligible non-participants (selection effects)
- Benefit levels may be insufficient for healthy diet in high-cost areas
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Impact varies by state SNAP policies, food prices, and food retail access
  relevant_geographies:
  - States with simplified enrollment show higher participation
  - High cost-of-living areas may have insufficient benefit levels
  - Rural areas with food deserts face compounded access barriers
