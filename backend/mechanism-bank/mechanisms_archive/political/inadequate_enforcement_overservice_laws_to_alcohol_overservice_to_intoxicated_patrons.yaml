direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low enforcement activity and minimal penalties reduce perceived risk of
  consequences for overservice violations'
- 'Step 2: Establishments and servers lack accountability mechanisms and deterrents
  for serving intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 3: Economic incentives to maximize alcohol sales override legal obligations
  to refuse service'
- 'Step 4: Widespread overservice becomes normalized practice (79% overservice rate
  observed), as violations go largely unpunished'
