direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry opposition prevents or weakens implementation of evidence-based
  population-level policies (minimum unit pricing, advertising restrictions, taxation)'
- 'Step 2: Absence or weakening of effective policies maintains high alcohol availability,
  affordability, and promotional exposure in the population'
- 'Step 3: Population-level alcohol consumption remains elevated due to lack of effective
  structural interventions'
- 'Step 4: Higher population consumption translates to increased alcohol-related morbidity
  and mortality across the population'
