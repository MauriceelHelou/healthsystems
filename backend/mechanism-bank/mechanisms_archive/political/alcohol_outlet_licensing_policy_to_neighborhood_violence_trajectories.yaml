direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permissive licensing policies allow additional alcohol outlets to operate
  in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: New outlets increase the spatial density and clustering of alcohol retail
  establishments'
- 'Step 3: Increased density creates conditions for violence escalation through the
  mechanisms described above (increased availability, congregation, intoxication)'
- 'Step 4: Neighborhoods may reach ''tipping points'' where the outlet environment
  transitions from stable to elevated violence conditions'
- 'Step 5: Without intervention, violence trajectories become self-reinforcing as
  high-violence areas experience disinvestment and reduced social cohesion'

    to tipping points, where additional licenses could trigger transitions to elevated

    and neighborhood socioeconomic conditions modifies vulnerability to policy-induced
    violence increases.
