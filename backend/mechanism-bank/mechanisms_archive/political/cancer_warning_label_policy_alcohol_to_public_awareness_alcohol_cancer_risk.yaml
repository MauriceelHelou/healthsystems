direction: positive

  creates point-of-purchase exposure to health information'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure to warning labels during alcohol purchase and consumption
  increases consumer contact with cancer risk information'
- 'Step 3: Warning labels address information asymmetry by providing health risk data
  that alcohol industry marketing does not convey'
- 'Step 4: Population-level awareness of alcohol-related cancer risk increases as
  consumers encounter warnings across multiple alcohol products and occasions'
