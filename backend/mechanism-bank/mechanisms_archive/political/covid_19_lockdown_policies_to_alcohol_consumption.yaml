direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lockdown policies mandate working from home, social distancing, and home
  schooling'
- 'Step 2: These mandates concentrate gendered emotional and relational labor burdens
  on women, particularly caregiving and household management'
- 'Step 3: Increased stress from managing immediate gendered stressors creates need
  for coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol''s immediate psychosocial effects (stress relief, emotional regulation)
  become more salient than long-term physical health risks'
- 'Step 5: Women prioritize psychosocial wellbeing over physical health in their risk
  calculus, leading to increased or sustained alcohol use'
