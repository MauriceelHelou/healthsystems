- 'Step 1: Enforcement policies create systematic detection and deterrence of alcohol-impaired
  driving'
- 'Step 2: Reduced prevalence of drunk driving decreases alcohol as causal factor
  in crashes'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of alcohol-impaired drivers on roads reduces crash severity
  and fatality risk'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related traffic fatalities decline at population level'
