- 'Step 1: Policy shifts toward increased enforcement of drug-related offenses and
  reduced investment in community-based treatment alternatives'
- 'Step 2: Law enforcement practices prioritize arrest and prosecution over diversion
  to treatment programs'

  increases untreated SUD prevalence and associated criminalized behaviors'
