direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal access to spirits and hard liquor becomes available at age 18 (in
  addition to beer/wine available since 16)'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability of higher alcohol content beverages coincides with
  continued novice driver period'
- 'Step 3: Novice driver effect remains primary mortality risk factor as youth have
  limited driving experience'
- 'Step 4: Discontinuous increase in deaths occurs at age 18 threshold, with minimal
  contribution from expanded alcohol access'
