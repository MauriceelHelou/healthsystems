direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy eliminates the structural opportunity to purchase alcohol from convenient
  off-premise locations during late-night hours when binge drinking episodes typically
  occur'
- 'Step 2: Youth and young adults face increased barriers (time, distance, cost) to
  obtaining additional alcohol once on-premise establishments close or during late-night
  social gatherings'
- 'Step 3: Higher transaction costs and reduced convenience interrupt patterns of
  continued drinking and limit the quantity of alcohol consumed during high-risk periods'
- 'Step 4: Reduced binge drinking episodes lead to fewer acute alcohol poisoning cases
  and alcohol-related medical emergencies requiring hospitalization'

  description: Areas with established patterns of late-night off-premise alcohol purchases
    may show stronger policy effects as the intervention directly disrupts existing
    high-risk drinking patterns.

  description: In areas with greater density of on-premise establishments (bars, clubs)
    that remain open late, youth may substitute off-premise with on-premise consumption,
    potentially weakening the policy effect.
