direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ignition interlock devices offer equivalent deterrent effect to incarceration
  (1-year interlock = 10-day jail increase on average)'
- 'Step 2: Policy shift toward interlock devices reduces reliance on jail time as
  primary DUI penalty'
- 'Step 3: Reduced incarceration exposure decreases collateral consequences of criminal
  justice involvement (employment disruption, family separation, criminal record impacts)'
- 'Step 4: Overall reduction in criminalization burden while maintaining traffic safety
  deterrence'
