category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permissive BAC legal limits create a social and legal environment where
  driving with alcohol in the system is legally sanctioned up to a threshold'
- 'Step 2: This legal tolerance normalizes alcohol-impaired driving behaviors and
  reduces perceived risk of legal consequences for drivers with BAC below the limit'
- 'Step 3: Drivers with BACs between legal limit and complete sobriety have impaired
  reaction times, judgment, and motor coordination'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-impaired cognitive and motor function increases crash risk and
  severity of injuries in traffic accidents'
- 'Step 5: Higher prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving results in increased fatalities
  among drivers'
