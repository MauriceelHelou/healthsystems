- 'Step 1: Evidence-based policies regulate alcohol availability, marketing, and pricing
  at population level'
- 'Step 2: Regulatory policies modify environmental exposure to alcohol-promoting
  factors (advertising, outlet density, affordability)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced environmental exposure decreases population-level alcohol consumption
  patterns'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption rates reduce incidence of alcohol-related health conditions,
  injuries, and social harms across the population'
