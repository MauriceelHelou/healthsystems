mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory implementation of IoT devices with alcohol sensors prevents vehicle
  ignition when driver is intoxicated'
- 'Step 2: Machine learning-enabled camera systems detect signs of drowsiness (micro-sleep,
  frequent yawns) during driving'
- 'Step 3: Real-time alerts through vehicle sound system or buzzer warn drowsy drivers
  to take corrective action'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of drunk driving and intervention in drowsy driving reduce human
  error-induced crashes and fatalities'
