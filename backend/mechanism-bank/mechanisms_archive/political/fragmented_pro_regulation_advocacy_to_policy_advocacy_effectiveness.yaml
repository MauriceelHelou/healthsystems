  node_name: Reduced Effectiveness of Pro-Health Policy Advocacy
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pro-regulation actors (different government ministries, public health advocates)
  each advance their own specific interests rather than unified health message'
- 'Step 2: Fragmentation results in smaller collective voice and inconsistent framing
  of alcohol regulation issues'
- 'Step 3: Lack of coordination reduces political power and media presence compared
  to cohesive industry messaging'
- 'Step 4: Weakened advocacy capacity makes it difficult to counter dominant industry
  opposition and sustain policy momentum'
