mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus alcohol policies establish norms and enforcement mechanisms that
  shape availability and acceptability of alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Restrictive policies reduce environmental cues and opportunities for excessive
  alcohol consumption on campus and in surrounding areas'
- 'Step 3: Decreased alcohol availability and increased perceived consequences reduce
  frequency and intensity of binge drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: Lower binge drinking rates reduce associated risk behaviors including firearm
  access during intoxication'
