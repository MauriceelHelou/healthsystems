  availability, marketing, and sales'
- 'Step 2: Weak regulatory framework allows widespread alcohol access and normalization
  of harmful consumption patterns'

  road-traffic injuries, and gender-based violence'
- 'Step 4: These harms create ongoing burden on healthcare, police, and transport
  systems independent of COVID-19'
