direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Federal regulations require in-person evaluation before prescribing buprenorphine
  for opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 2: In-person requirement creates barriers for people lacking transportation,
  living in rural areas, or with competing work/childcare demands'
- 'Step 3: People with opioid use disorder who cannot access in-person appointments
  remain untreated'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers prevent treatment initiation despite clinical need
  and medication availability'
