direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pictorial warning labels with lived experience imagery increase perceived
  narrativity by allowing viewers to construct story-like mental representations'
- 'Step 2: Higher perceived narrativity engages cognitive processing through narrative
  transportation rather than defensive processing'
- 'Step 3: Narrative engagement reduces psychological resistance and defensive responses
  to warning messages'
- 'Step 4: Lower reactance manifests as reduced counter-arguing and rejection of health
  risk information'
