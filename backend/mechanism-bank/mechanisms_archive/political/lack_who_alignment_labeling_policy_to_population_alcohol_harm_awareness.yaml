- 'Step 2: Gap between international best practices and national policy creates suboptimal
  health protection infrastructure'
- 'Step 3: Population-wide exposure to evidence-based alcohol risk information, including

- 'Step 5: Population normalization of alcohol consumption including during pregnancy
  persists'
