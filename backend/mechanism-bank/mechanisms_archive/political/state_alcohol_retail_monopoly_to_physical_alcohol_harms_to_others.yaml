direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State monopoly on alcohol retail/wholesale purchases restricts commercial
  availability of alcohol through limiting number and hours of outlets'
- 'Step 2: Reduced commercial availability decreases overall alcohol consumption and
  heavy drinking occasions in the population'
- 'Step 3: Lower population-level alcohol consumption reduces incidents of alcohol-related
  violence and aggression'
- 'Step 4: Fewer intoxicated individuals in public spaces decreases likelihood of
  physical assault, property damage, and other physical harms to bystanders'
