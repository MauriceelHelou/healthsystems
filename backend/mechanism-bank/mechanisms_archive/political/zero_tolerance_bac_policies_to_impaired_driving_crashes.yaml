direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zero-tolerance policies lower BAC thresholds below actual impairment levels,
  criminalizing unimpaired drivers'
- 'Step 2: Criminal justice resources are diverted away from the most problematic
  impaired drivers (those with highest BAC levels and crash risk) to process lower-BAC
  offenders'
- 'Step 3: Resource dilution reduces enforcement capacity and deterrence for the highest-risk
  drivers who cause the majority of fatal crashes'
- 'Step 4: Net widening effect fails to prevent crashes while creating collateral
  consequences for low-risk drivers'

    with high BAC levels (>0.15), lowering thresholds to 0.05 increases mismatch between
