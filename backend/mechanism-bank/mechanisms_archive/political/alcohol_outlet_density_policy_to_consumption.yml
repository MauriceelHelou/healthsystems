mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permissive alcohol licensing policies and weak zoning enforcement create high density of alcohol
  retail outlets (bars, liquor stores, convenience stores)'
- 'Step 2: High outlet density increases physical availability and convenience of alcohol purchase, reducing
  barriers to acquisition'
- 'Step 3: Concentrated outlets in neighborhoods create environmental cues and normalization of heavy
  drinking'
- 'Step 4: Price competition among dense outlets may reduce alcohol costs, increasing affordability'
- 'Step 5: Easy alcohol access combined with marketing and social normalization increases consumption
  including binge drinking at population level'

  equity_implications: 'Alcohol outlet density is not market-driven but reflects political decisions about
    licensing, zoning, and enforcement that systematically disadvantage certain communities. The alcohol
    industry deliberately targets high-poverty neighborhoods and communities of color with dense outlet
    placement and aggressive marketing. Local governments dependent on alcohol tax revenue approve outlets
    despite community opposition. Zoning laws protect affluent neighborhoods from outlet proliferation
    while concentrating them in marginalized areas. This represents environmental racism—policy-driven
    unequal exposure to health hazards. High alcohol consumption and related harms in over-saturated neighborhoods
    reflect structural violence, not individual choices or cultural pathologies. Communities organizing
    against outlet density face industry lobbying power. Addressing this requires: municipal alcohol outlet
    density limits, community control over licensing decisions, zoning equity, restriction of outlets
    near schools and residential areas, and challenging industry political influence over local alcohol
    policy.'
assumptions:
- Outlet density measured as licenses per capita or per square mile
- Mechanism operates through both physical availability and social normalization
- Policies include licensing limits, zoning restrictions, and hours of sale regulations
limitations:
- Individual-level factors (income, preferences) mediate outlet density effects
- Online alcohol sales and delivery may reduce importance of physical outlet proximity
- Cultural and regulatory context creates variation in density-consumption relationship across regions
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Outlet density varies dramatically by local licensing policies, zoning, and enforcement,
    with systematic inequities by neighborhood demographics
  relevant_geographies:
  - Low-income urban neighborhoods often have 3-5x higher outlet density than affluent areas
  - Communities of color face concentrated outlet placement through discriminatory zoning and industry
    targeting
  - Some cities have enacted outlet density limits and conditional use permits
  - State alcohol control systems (e.g., Pennsylvania, Utah) limit private retail, reducing overall density
