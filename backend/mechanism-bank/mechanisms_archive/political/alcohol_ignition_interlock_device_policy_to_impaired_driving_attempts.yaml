direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandated IID installation creates a physical barrier requiring breath alcohol
  concentration (BAC) testing before vehicle ignition'
- 'Step 2: IID technology prevents vehicle operation when driver BAC exceeds programmed
  threshold'
- 'Step 3: Real-time feedback and mechanical prevention reduce opportunities for drinking
  and driving behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Continued exposure to IID creates temporal separation between drinking
  occasions and driving attempts'

    BAC lockouts, suggesting low awareness of alcohol-related behaviors as problematic

  description: Drivers who did not consider their alcohol-related behaviors problematic
    showed different patterns of IID performance, indicating problem recognition moderates
