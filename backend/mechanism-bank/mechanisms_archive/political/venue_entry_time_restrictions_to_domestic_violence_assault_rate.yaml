direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Entry restrictions prevent new patrons from entering venues after 1:00-1:30
  a.m., limiting the number of people who can begin or continue drinking during peak
  late-night hours'
- 'Step 2: Restricted entry reduces venue capacity and crowding during late-night
  hours, decreasing overall alcohol sales and consumption'
- 'Step 3: Earlier departure times and reduced late-night drinking result in lower
  blood alcohol concentrations when patrons return home'
- 'Step 4: Lower intoxication levels upon returning to domestic settings reduce the
  physiological and cognitive impairments that facilitate violent behavior'

  description: The timing of entry restrictions (1:00 a.m. vs 1:30 a.m.) may moderate
    effectiveness, with earlier restrictions potentially having stronger effects by
    preventing the most problematic late-night drinking period

  description: Entry restrictions combined with trading cessation times and alcohol
    service restrictions appear more effective than entry restrictions alone, suggesting
    synergistic policy effects
