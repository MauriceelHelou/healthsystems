direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Governments implement pricing policies through taxation, minimum pricing,
  or other fiscal mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Price increases create economic barriers to purchasing alcohol and tobacco
  products'
- 'Step 3: Integrated price elasticities capture both participation effects (whether
  to purchase) and consumption effects (how much to purchase)'
- 'Step 4: Population-level consumption of both substances decreases, with effect
  sizes dependent on elasticity estimates used in policy modeling tools like the Sheffield
  Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model'

    substance

  description: The study's elasticity estimates, when used in policy models, produce
    bigger changes in consumption for the same price change compared to other existing
    estimates
