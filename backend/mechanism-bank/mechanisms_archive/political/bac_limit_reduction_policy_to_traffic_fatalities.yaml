mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lowering BAC limits from 0.08 to 0.05 criminalizes drivers who are not
  meaningfully impaired based on crash risk data'
- 'Step 2: Criminal justice system capacity becomes saturated processing increased
  volume of low-risk offenders'
- 'Step 3: Reduced enforcement focus on high-BAC drivers (who have exponentially higher
  crash risk) allows most dangerous drivers to continue driving impaired'
- 'Step 4: No meaningful reduction in fatal crashes occurs because policy does not
  target the driver population responsible for most fatalities'

  description: In jurisdictions where most fatal crashes involve drivers with BAC
    >0.15, lowering limits to 0.05 has minimal impact on fatality reduction while
    maximizing resource diversion
- name: alternative_transportation_availability
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Areas with robust public transit or ride-sharing may see modest behavioral
    changes at lower BAC thresholds, though crash risk at 0.05-0.08 BAC remains relatively
    low
