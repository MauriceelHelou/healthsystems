- 'Step 1: Dedicated DUI patrols concentrate law enforcement resources on detecting
  and removing impaired drivers from roadways'
- 'Step 2: Increased apprehension rates create specific and general deterrent effects
  through both removal of impaired drivers and increased perceived enforcement risk'
- 'Step 3: Combined incapacitation and deterrence effects reduce alcohol-impaired
  driving incidents at population level'
