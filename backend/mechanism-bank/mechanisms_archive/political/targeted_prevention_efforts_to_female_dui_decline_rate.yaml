direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: DUI prevention efforts and interventions were not specifically targeted
  to women''s contexts and risk factors'
- 'Step 2: Male DUI rates declined more steeply than female rates in recent years
  (post-early 2000s)'
- 'Step 3: Gender-neutral interventions may be more effective for male-typical drinking
  and driving contexts'
- 'Step 4: Lack of female-targeted prevention results in slower decline in female
  DUI prevalence compared to males, continuing to narrow the gender gap'

  description: Effect is more pronounced in recent years (post-early 2000s) when the
    narrowing gender gap is primarily due to differential decline rates rather than
    enforcement changes

  strength: weak
  description: Effects observed across all four age groups (18-20, 21-34, 35-49, and
    50-64) though specific differential effects by age not detailed in abstract
