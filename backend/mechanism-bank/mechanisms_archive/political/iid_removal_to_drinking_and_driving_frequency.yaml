direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IID removal eliminates physical technological barrier that prevented vehicle
  ignition after drinking'
- 'Step 2: Restoration of unrestricted vehicle access removes structural constraint
  on drinking and driving behavior'
- 'Step 3: Absence of real-time monitoring eliminates immediate detection and accountability
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Offenders return to pre-IID behavioral patterns without ongoing technological
  intervention to sustain behavior change'
