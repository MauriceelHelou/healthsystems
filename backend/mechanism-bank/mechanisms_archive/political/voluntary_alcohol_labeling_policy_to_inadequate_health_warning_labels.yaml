  node_name: Inadequate Health Warning Labels on Alcohol Containers
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Voluntary labeling systems lack regulatory enforcement mechanisms and standardized
  requirements for alcohol manufacturers'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol industry has financial incentives to minimize prominence and comprehensiveness
  of health warnings that may reduce consumption'
- 'Step 3: Without mandatory standards, warning labels remain small (pregnancy pictograms
  averaging 45 mm²), inconsistently applied (only 80% prevalence), and fail to meet
  evidence-informed design recommendations'
- 'Step 4: Industry-led initiatives (73% of containers) emphasize vague ''responsible
  consumption'' messages rather than specific health risks, diluting health warnings'
