direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systematic stakeholder mapping identifies actors with required knowledge
  including academics, civil society organizations with lived experience, and policy
  professionals working at the forefront of policy development'
- 'Step 2: Multi-phase engagement activities (interviews, workshops) co-produce model
  focus, structure, and assumptions that reflect local policy context and community
  realities'
- 'Step 3: Stakeholder input guides critical modeling decisions including choice of
  policy intervention, population subgroups of interest, data sources, and economic
  and health outcomes to measure'
- 'Step 4: Ongoing engagement through development, validation, and communication phases
  ensures research methods and findings are highly contextualized and tailored to
  decision-maker needs'
- 'Step 5: Contextualized, understandable, and credible policy evidence is communicated
  widely beyond academia to inform alcohol policy decisions'
