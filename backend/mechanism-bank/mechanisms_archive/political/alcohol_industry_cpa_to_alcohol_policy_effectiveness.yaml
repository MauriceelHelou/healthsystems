  node_name: Effectiveness of Alcohol Control Policies
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry engages in CPA strategies including accessing and influencing
  policy-making processes, manufacturing support for industry positions, and shaping
  evidence to create doubt'
- 'Step 2: Industry frames policy actors (positioning themselves as legitimate stakeholders),
  problems (redefining alcohol harms), and solutions (proposing industry-favorable
  alternatives to regulation)'
- 'Step 3: CPA strategies displace and usurp public health approaches, substituting
  self-regulation and voluntary measures for effective statutory policies'
- 'Step 4: Evidence-based policies such as pricing controls, availability restrictions,
  and marketing bans are blocked, diluted, or delayed'
- 'Step 5: Weakened or absent alcohol control policies fail to reduce population-level
  alcohol consumption and related harms'
