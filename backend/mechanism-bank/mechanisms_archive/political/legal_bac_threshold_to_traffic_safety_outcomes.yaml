mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal BAC thresholds establish the regulatory framework for alcohol-impaired
  driving enforcement'
- 'Step 2: Higher legal BAC limits (e.g., 0.08% vs 0.05%) permit more impaired drivers
  to operate vehicles legally'
- 'Step 3: Evidence shows measurable driving impairment at 0.05% BAC including increased
  lane keeping variability and speed control problems'
- 'Step 4: Drivers operating between 0.05-0.08% BAC experience degraded performance
  but face no legal consequences, increasing crash risk exposure for all road users'
