direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher installation rates extend interlock deterrent effects to larger
  subset of alcohol-impaired driver population'
- 'Step 2: More drivers with interlocks installed means more vehicles with physical
  barriers to impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: Broader coverage reduces overall population exposure to alcohol-impaired
  driving risk'
- 'Step 4: Population-level traffic injuries from drinking and driving decrease as
  more high-risk drivers are prevented from impaired operation'
