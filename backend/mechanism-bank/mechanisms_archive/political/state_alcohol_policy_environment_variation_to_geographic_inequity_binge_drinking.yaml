  node_name: Geographic Inequity in Binge Drinking Risk
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State legislatures have varying political will and capacity to enact evidence-based
  alcohol control policies'
- 'Step 2: This creates substantial state-to-state variation in alcohol policy environments
  (regulatory strength, taxation levels, enforcement)'
- 'Step 3: Residents of states with weaker policy environments face greater structural
  exposure to alcohol availability and marketing'
- 'Step 4: Geographic inequities in binge drinking emerge as state policy choices
  create differential risk environments for identical individuals based solely on
  residence location'
