mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice system overrepresents individuals with opioid use disorder
  (OUD), concentrating a high-risk population in institutional settings'
- 'Step 2: Incarceration disrupts continuity of evidence-based OUD treatment and recovery
  support networks'
- 'Step 3: Release from incarceration without adequate reintegration support creates
  periods of extreme vulnerability due to reduced tolerance and lack of healthcare
  navigation'
- 'Step 4: Absence of peer support specialists and interdisciplinary addiction care
  during and post-incarceration leaves individuals without critical recovery resources'
- 'Step 5: High-risk transitions and lack of structural support systems lead to increased
  morbidity and mortality from opioid overdose'
