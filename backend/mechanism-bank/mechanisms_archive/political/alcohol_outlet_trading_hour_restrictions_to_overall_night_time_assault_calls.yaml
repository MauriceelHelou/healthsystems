direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: National maximum trading hour restrictions limit on-premises alcohol outlet
  hours to between 8am and 4am'
- 'Step 2: However, survey found only 6% of bars/nightclubs were actually affected
  because most did not trade as long as their licensed hours permitted'
- 'Step 3: Minimal change in actual alcohol availability during most night-time hours
  (9pm-4am) due to low proportion of affected outlets'
- 'Step 4: Insufficient reduction in alcohol availability to impact violence during
  broader night-time period'
- 'Step 5: No measurable change in overall night-time assault calls (9pm-6am)'

  description: The gap between licensed hours and actual trading hours meant that
    only a small proportion of outlets were affected by the restrictions, limiting
    the policy's impact on overall night-time violence. Most outlets already closed
    before the new restricted hours.
