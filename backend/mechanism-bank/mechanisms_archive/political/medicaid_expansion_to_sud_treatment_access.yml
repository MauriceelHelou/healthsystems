- 'Step 1: ACA Medicaid expansion extends coverage to adults <138% FPL, dramatically reducing uninsured
  rates in low-income populations with high AUD prevalence'
- 'Step 2: Medicaid covers substance use disorder treatment including counseling, medications (naltrexone,
  acamprosate), and residential services'
- 'Step 3: Insurance coverage eliminates financial barrier to treatment, enabling individuals with AUD
  to access previously unaffordable care'
- 'Step 4: Medicaid expansion increases treatment facility capacity as providers gain sustainable reimbursement
  for serving low-income populations'
- 'Step 5: Population-level increase in treatment access reduces AUD prevalence through higher treatment
  initiation and completion rates'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: policy
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: 'Medicaid expansion represents explicit policy choice about whether healthcare
    including addiction treatment is right or privilege. States refusing expansion are disproportionately
    in the South with large Black populations, perpetuating historical health inequities rooted in racism.
    The expansion-treatment gradient demonstrates that lack of addiction care is policy-driven, not resource
    scarcity. Non-expansion states force low-income individuals with AUD to remain uninsured and untreated,
    predictably generating worse health outcomes and higher emergency care costs. This is structural violence—deliberate
    policy producing preventable suffering. Communities of color in non-expansion states face compounded
    harm from both higher AUD prevalence (driven by structural determinants) and systematic denial of
    treatment coverage. The variation across states proves addiction treatment access is political choice.
    Addressing this requires: Medicaid expansion in all states, federal baseline SUD benefit standards,
    robust parity enforcement, and ultimately universal healthcare that breaks link between state politics
    and treatment access.'
assumptions:
- Expansion refers to ACA Medicaid eligibility to 138% FPL for adults
- States retain flexibility in benefit design and provider reimbursement rates
- Mechanism operates through both coverage expansion and provider participation
limitations:
- Treatment access requires facilities accepting Medicaid; reimbursement rates affect participation
- Individual awareness and enrollment also affect coverage uptake
- Other barriers (transportation, stigma, childcare) persist despite coverage
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Medicaid expansion status creates stark state-level variation in coverage and treatment
    access, with systematic geographic and racial inequities
  relevant_geographies:
  - 12 states have not expanded Medicaid as of 2025, concentrated in the South
  - Non-expansion states are disproportionately those with large Black and Latino populations
  - Expansion states show 20-40% increases in SUD treatment utilization post-expansion
  - Border areas between expansion and non-expansion states show treatment migration patterns
