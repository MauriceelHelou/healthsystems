direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public health interventions (e.g., taxation, availability restrictions,
  marketing bans) reduce population-level alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Reduced consumption decreases incidence and prevalence of alcohol-attributable
  diseases including cirrhosis, cancers, cardiovascular disease, and injuries'
- 'Step 3: Mathematical models estimate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions
  by projecting changes in disease burden metrics (deaths, DALYs, QALYs)'
- 'Step 4: Cost-effective interventions can be prioritized for implementation to maximize
  population health gains'

- name: baseline_alcohol_consumption
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Interventions are more cost-effective in populations with higher baseline
    consumption due to greater potential for disease burden reduction
- name: existing_policy_environment
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: In jurisdictions with already strong alcohol control policies, incremental
    interventions may have lower cost-effectiveness
- name: local_data_availability
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Countries with better local data can develop more accurate models that
    better inform policy decisions and implementation
