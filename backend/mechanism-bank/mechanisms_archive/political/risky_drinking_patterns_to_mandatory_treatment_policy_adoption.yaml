direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Risky drinking patterns at population level indicate limited public health
  infrastructure for alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Countries with risky patterns lack medical and treatment resources for
  alcohol problems'
- 'Step 3: Without accessible treatment infrastructure, mandatory treatment policies
  are not politically feasible'
- 'Step 4: Result is lower adoption of treatment-oriented responses to drunk driving,
  favoring punitive-only approaches'
