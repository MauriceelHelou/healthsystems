mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Consumption-oriented policies (e.g., taxation, outlet density restrictions,
  sales restrictions) reduce overall alcohol availability and affordability in the
  population'
- 'Step 2: Reduced availability and affordability decreases population-level alcohol
  consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: Lower consumption rates reduce the probability of individuals having elevated
  BAC when driving, even below the legal limit'
- 'Step 4: Decreased prevalence of any alcohol-involved driving reduces crash fatalities,
  independent of driving-specific policies'
