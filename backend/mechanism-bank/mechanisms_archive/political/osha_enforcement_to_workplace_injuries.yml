description: Regulatory enforcement through OSHA inspections significantly reduces workplace injuries, with effects strongest when inspections result in penalties. Meta-analyses demonstrate that legislative and regulatory policy reduces workplace injuries, with group and organizational-level interventions more effective than individual-focused approaches.

  equity_implications: Workplace injuries disproportionately affect low-wage workers, immigrants, and workers in non-unionized settings who have less power to demand safe conditions. OSHA enforcement resources have not kept pace with workforce growth, creating inspection gaps. Temporary and gig workers often fall outside regulatory coverage. Policy should expand OSHA funding and coverage to non-standard employment.
assumptions:
- OSHA enforcement includes inspections, citations, and penalties
- Workplace injuries include both lost-workday injuries and fatalities
- Assumes adequate enforcement resources and inspector capacity
limitations:
- Enforcement effects may have declined over time (weaker in 1992-1998 vs earlier periods)
- Self-reporting of injuries may undercount actual incidents
- Small employers less likely to be inspected
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Federal OSHA coverage varies by state; state-plan states may have different enforcement intensity
  relevant_geographies:
  - State-plan states (22 states) may have different standards and enforcement
  - Rural areas have fewer inspection resources
  - States with right-to-work laws may have weaker worker protections
