mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different clinical algorithms for classifying alcohol exposure lead to
  dramatically different disease category assignments'
- 'Step 2: Varying thresholds and data sources for hazardous alcohol use affect which
  patients are classified as MetALD versus MASLD or ALD'
- 'Step 3: Classification methodology directly determines apparent prevalence of MetALD,
  ranging from 4.7% to 47.2% depending on criteria used'
