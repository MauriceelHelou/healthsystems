category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower BAC limit establishes stricter legal threshold for impaired driving
  prosecution and punishment'
- 'Step 2: General deterrent effect increases perceived risk of legal consequences
  for drinking and driving across population'
- 'Step 3: Drivers reduce alcohol consumption before driving or choose not to drive
  after drinking to avoid criminal penalties'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prevalence of impaired driving in population decreases fatal crashes
  involving drinking drivers'
