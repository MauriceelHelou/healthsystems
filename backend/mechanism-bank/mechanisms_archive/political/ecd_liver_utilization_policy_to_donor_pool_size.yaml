direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current allocation policies largely relegate ECD organs to low acuity recipients
  based on risk aversion'
- 'Step 2: Evidence demonstrates non-inferior outcomes (similar graft survival and
  rejection-free survival) in high acuity ECD recipients'
- 'Step 3: Policy expansion to allow ECD organ acceptance for high acuity patients
  increases available grafts for this population by 20.4%'
- 'Step 4: Expanded donor pool reduces structural barriers to transplant access for
  critically ill patients facing imminent mortality'
