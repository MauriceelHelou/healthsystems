direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Police encounters create acute stress and trauma for people living with
  HIV who use drugs, particularly in contexts of drug criminalization'
- 'Step 2: Fear of police interaction disrupts access to harm reduction services and
  healthcare facilities due to avoidance of public spaces'
- 'Step 3: Confiscation of drugs or disruption of drug supply during encounters may
  lead to substitution with more accessible alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Psychological distress from repeated criminalization and surveillance increases
  need for coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 5: Heavy alcohol use increases as accessible and legal substance in response
  to criminal justice system stress'
