direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended exposure to the same set of pictorial warning labels over time
  (2.5 years in Jordan) leads to habituation and familiarization'
- 'Step 2: Habituation reduces attention and cognitive processing of warning messages'
- 'Step 3: Reduced attention decreases the visual salience and noticeability of PWLs'
- 'Step 4: Erosion of salience diminishes upstream outcomes needed to sustain downstream
  motivation effects'

  description: Stronger initial PWL designs (e.g., depicting human suffering) may
    resist wear-out longer than weaker designs

  strength: strong
  description: Higher frequency smokers experience more rapid habituation due to repeated
    daily exposures to the same warning set
