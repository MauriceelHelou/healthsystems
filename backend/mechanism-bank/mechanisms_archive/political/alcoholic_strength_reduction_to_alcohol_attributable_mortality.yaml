to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_attributable_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Attributable Mortality
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Reduction of alcoholic strength in beverages (e.g., 10% reduction) decreases
  the amount of pure alcohol consumed per standard drink'
- 'Step 2: Lower alcohol content per beverage unit reduces overall population-level
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases exposure to alcohol''s toxic effects
  on multiple organ systems'
- 'Step 4: Decreased toxic exposure results in fewer alcohol-attributable deaths from
  liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancers, and injuries'
