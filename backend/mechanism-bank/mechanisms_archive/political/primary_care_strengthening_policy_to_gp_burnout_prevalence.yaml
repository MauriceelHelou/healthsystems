- 'Step 1: China''s healthcare reform efforts aim to strengthen primary healthcare
  delivery, increasing demands and expectations on general practitioners'
- 'Step 2: Rapid expansion of primary care services without proportional resource
  allocation creates structural strain on existing GP workforce'
- 'Step 3: GPs face increased patient volume, administrative burden, and performance
  pressures without adequate compensation or support infrastructure'
- 'Step 4: Mismatch between policy demands and resource availability creates conditions
  for widespread burnout among the GP workforce'
