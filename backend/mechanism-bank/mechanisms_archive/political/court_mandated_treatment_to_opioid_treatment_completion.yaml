mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court mandate creates structural requirement for treatment engagement with
  legal consequences for non-compliance'
- 'Step 2: Mandated individuals face reduced barriers to treatment initiation and
  sustained participation through court oversight and accountability mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Structured judicial monitoring provides external accountability that supports
  treatment retention beyond individual motivation'
- 'Step 4: Higher treatment completion rates achieved through combination of legal
  leverage and reduced treatment discontinuation'

  description: Female patients show persistent treatment completion rates around 59%
    across all three years when mandated, while males show variable completion rates
    (59%, 65%, 64%). The paper notes that treatment completion disparity between sexes
    increases even when females are mandated, suggesting differential effectiveness
    of court mandate by gender.
- name: voluntary_vs_mandated_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Court mandate serves as primary moderator distinguishing this pathway
    from voluntary treatment, with mandated treatment showing greater completion rates
    compared to non-mandated treatment pathways for opioid use disorder.
