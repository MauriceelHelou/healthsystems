mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government alcohol excise tax policy sets the price floor and taxation
  structure for alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Tax policy changes alter the real price of alcohol across retail outlets
  and licensed premises'
- 'Step 3: Population-level alcohol affordability and consumption patterns shift in
  response to price changes'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption lowers the incidence of intoxication-related
  interpersonal violence'
- 'Step 5: Fewer violent incidents result in reduced emergency department attendances,
  lowering associated healthcare system costs'
