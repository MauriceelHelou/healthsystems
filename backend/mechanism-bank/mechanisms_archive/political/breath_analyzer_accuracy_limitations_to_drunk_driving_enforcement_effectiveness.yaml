direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Breath analyzers used by law enforcement do not accurately measure blood
  alcohol content (BAC), requiring blood sample analysis for further legal action'
- 'Step 2: This inaccuracy creates delays and procedural barriers in enforcement,
  as preliminary screening cannot be used as definitive evidence'
- 'Step 3: The gap between preliminary screening and confirmatory testing reduces
  the certainty and immediacy of consequences for drunk driving'
- 'Step 4: Reduced enforcement effectiveness weakens deterrent effect on drunk driving
  behavior at population level'
