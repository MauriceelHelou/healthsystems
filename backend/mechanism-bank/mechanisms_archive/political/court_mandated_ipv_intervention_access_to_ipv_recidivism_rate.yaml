direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court-mandated intervention programs provide structured treatment for IPV
  perpetrators with cognitive and behavioral components'
- 'Step 2: Completion of intervention programs addresses deficits in emotional information
  processing and behavioral regulation'
- 'Step 3: Improved cognitive and emotional functioning reduces propensity for violent
  behavior'
- 'Step 4: Lower violence recidivism rates among treatment completers, particularly
  those with low alcohol consumption'

  description: High alcohol consumption/misuse significantly weakens intervention
    effectiveness. Treatment completers with low alcohol consumption showed lowest
    recidivism rates, while high alcohol consumption is associated with intervention
    dropout and higher recidivism
