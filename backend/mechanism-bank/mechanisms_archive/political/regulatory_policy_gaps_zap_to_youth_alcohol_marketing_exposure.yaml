direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inconsistent definitions of zero-alcohol products (ZAPs) across policies
  create regulatory gaps, with products between 0.05%-1.15% alcohol covered under
  some but not all policies, and products under 0.5% alcohol having limited coverage'
- 'Step 2: Industry-managed self-regulatory codes have limited application to ZAPs,
  allowing alcohol brands to market products with similar branding and messaging without
  oversight'
- 'Step 3: Regulatory gaps enable alcohol companies to use ZAPs as brand extension
  marketing tools that reach youth through channels restricted for alcoholic products'
- 'Step 4: Increased youth exposure to alcohol brand marketing through ZAPs maintains
  brand awareness and positive associations despite declining youth drinking rates'
