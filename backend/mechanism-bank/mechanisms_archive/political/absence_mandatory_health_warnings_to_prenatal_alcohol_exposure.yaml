direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy failure to mandate pregnancy-specific health warnings removes systematic
  barrier to prenatal alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Lack of drinking guidelines and standard drinks information on labels prevents
  pregnant women from understanding safe consumption limits (none during pregnancy)'
- 'Step 3: Absence of links to alcohol education websites eliminates access point
  to evidence-based prenatal alcohol risk information'
- 'Step 4: Normalization of alcohol consumption continues unchallenged at point of
  purchase, facilitating prenatal exposure'
- 'Step 5: Increased prenatal alcohol exposure elevates risk of fetal alcohol spectrum
  disorders'
