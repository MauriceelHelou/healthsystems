direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Safety net policy establishes clear criteria and time windows (60-365 days
  post-liver transplant) for kidney transplant eligibility'
- 'Step 2: Explicit policy framework incentivizes transplant centers to identify and
  list eligible patients early'
- 'Step 3: Guaranteed access pathway through safety net reduces uncertainty and delays
  in listing decisions'
- 'Step 4: Proportion of candidates listed within 1 year after liver transplant increases
  from 63.6% to 94.8%'
