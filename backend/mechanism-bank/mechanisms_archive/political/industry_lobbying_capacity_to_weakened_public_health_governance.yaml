direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: One-third of registered lobbyists have prior government experience, creating
  a professionalized lobbying workforce with insider knowledge'
- 'Step 2: Industries gain systematic advantages in policy advocacy through access
  to former government insiders who understand bureaucratic processes and have established
  networks'
- 'Step 3: Policy-making becomes asymmetrically influenced, with industry voices amplified
  relative to public health advocates who lack such insider access'
- 'Step 4: Governance structures and regulatory protections are weakened or fail to
  be strengthened, creating ethical and moral problems that pose risks to public health'
