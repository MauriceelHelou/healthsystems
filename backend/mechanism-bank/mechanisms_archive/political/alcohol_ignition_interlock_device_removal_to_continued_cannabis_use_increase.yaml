direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: After mandated IID period ends, device is removed and drivers regain unrestricted
  vehicle access'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol use returns to pre-IID levels as physical barrier to alcohol-impaired
  driving is eliminated'
- 'Step 3: Cannabis use patterns established during IID period persist and further
  increase after removal rather than reverting to baseline'
- 'Step 4: Drivers maintain elevated cannabis use while also resuming alcohol use,
  resulting in polysubstance use pattern'
