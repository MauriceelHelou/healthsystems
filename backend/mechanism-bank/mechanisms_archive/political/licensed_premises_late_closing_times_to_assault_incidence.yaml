- 'Step 1: Extended operating hours of licensed premises allow continued alcohol service
  into late night hours'
- 'Step 2: Concentration of drinking activity in licensed premises extends later into
  the night compared to home settings'
- 'Step 3: Late-night drinking occasions result in significantly elevated blood alcohol
  concentrations'
- 'Step 4: High intoxication levels combined with public place congregation increases
  assault risk, with peaks occurring 3-5am coinciding with closing times'
