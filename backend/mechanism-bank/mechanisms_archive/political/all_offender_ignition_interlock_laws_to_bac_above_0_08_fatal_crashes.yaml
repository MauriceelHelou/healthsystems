  devices for all convicted drunk driving offenders'
- 'Step 2: Devices physically prevent vehicle ignition when driver''s blood alcohol
  content exceeds predetermined threshold'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive coverage of all offenders (not just repeat offenders) creates
  broader population-level prevention of alcohol-impaired driving'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in alcohol-impaired driving events leads to decreased fatal motor
  vehicle crashes involving elevated blood alcohol levels'
