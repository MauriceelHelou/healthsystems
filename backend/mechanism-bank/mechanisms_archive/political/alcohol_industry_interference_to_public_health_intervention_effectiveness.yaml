  node_name: Effectiveness of Public Health Alcohol Warning Label Interventions
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry representatives file complaints with government about
  enhanced warning labels including cancer messaging'
- 'Step 2: Industry pressure results in government requiring removal of cancer warning
  label and 2-month intervention pause'
- 'Step 3: Reduced intervention dose (fewer label messages, shorter exposure duration)
  diminishes potential population health impact'
- 'Step 4: Modified intervention limits knowledge gains and behavior change that would
  support safer alcohol consumption including during pregnancy'
