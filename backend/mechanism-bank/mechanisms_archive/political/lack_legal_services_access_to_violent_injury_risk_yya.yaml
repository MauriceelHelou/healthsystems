category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth and young adults face legal challenges (criminal justice involvement,
  housing issues, documentation needs) without access to legal advocacy'
- 'Step 2: Unresolved legal problems create instability, limit opportunities, and
  increase exposure to violence-prone situations'
- 'Step 3: Criminal justice involvement without legal support perpetuates cycles of
  system contact and community violence exposure'
- 'Step 4: Absence of legal services removes protective factors and contributes to
  ongoing violence vulnerability'
