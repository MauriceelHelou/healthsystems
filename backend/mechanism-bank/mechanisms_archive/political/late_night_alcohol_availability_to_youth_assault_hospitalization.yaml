direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended alcohol trading hours (particularly 24-hour licenses and sales
  after 4 a.m.) create structural opportunities for late-night alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Young adults (ages 15-29) disproportionately participate in late-night
  social activities and drinking venues during weekend nights'
- 'Step 3: Greater alcohol availability during peak youth social hours increases consumption
  levels and intoxication among this age group'
- 'Step 4: Intoxication increases both perpetration of violence and vulnerability
  to victimization among young people in social settings'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of alcohol-related violence in youth populations result in
  increased hospitalizations for assault injuries'

  description: Youth (15-29 years) showed greatest response to policy with 18% reduction
    compared to 11% overall reduction, suggesting this age group has higher baseline
    exposure to late-night drinking environments and thus greater vulnerability to
    extended alcohol availability
