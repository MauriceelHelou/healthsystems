direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State policies mandate RBS retraining only every 3-5 years, creating extended
  gaps between formal training'
- 'Step 2: During the 3-5 year interval, servers receive no structured reinforcement
  of RBS knowledge or skills'
- 'Step 3: Without ongoing practice and professional development, servers'' ability
  to identify intoxication and implement refusal strategies deteriorates'
- 'Step 4: Degraded RBS skills result in reduced rates of service refusal to intoxicated
  patrons over time'
