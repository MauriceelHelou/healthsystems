direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Automotive companies invest in lobbying to influence regulatory agencies
  and shape the regulatory environment'
- 'Step 2: Increased lobbying creates institutional legitimacy and reduces regulatory
  scrutiny, weakening enforcement mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Reduced regulatory pressure and institutional legitimacy decrease both
  voluntary firm-initiated recalls and mandatory regulator-initiated recalls'
- 'Step 4: Fewer recalls mean defective vehicles remain in use, increasing risk of
  accidents, injuries, and fatalities that disproportionately affect lower-income
  consumers who cannot afford newer, safer vehicles'

moderators:
- name: defect_severity
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher defect severity moderates the relationship between lobbying
    and recalls, suggesting lobbying is less effective at preventing recalls when
    defects are more severe
- name: media_coverage
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Greater media coverage moderates the relationship between lobbying
    and recalls; the interaction between media coverage and lobbying mediates the
    interaction between defect severity and lobbying (full indirect moderation)
