direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Expanded policy adoption of interlock devices as standard DUI penalty increases
  population-level exposure to deterrent'
- 'Step 2: General deterrence effect reduces pre-conviction drunk driving behavior
  across broader population'
- 'Step 3: Specific deterrence effect prevents vehicle operation by convicted offenders
  with devices installed'
- 'Step 4: Combined general and specific deterrence reduces overall incidence of alcohol-impaired
  driving'
- 'Step 5: Reduced drunk driving frequency decreases DUI-related crashes, injuries,
  and fatalities'
