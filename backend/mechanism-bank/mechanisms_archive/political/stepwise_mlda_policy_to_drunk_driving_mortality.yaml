direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stepwise MLDA policy (16 for beer/wine, 18 for spirits) creates graduated
  legal access to alcohol during adolescence'
- 'Step 2: Policy assumes gradual introduction reduces harmful behaviors including
  drunk driving'
- 'Step 3: However, policy timing coincides with driving licensure when youth have
  minimal driving experience'
- 'Step 4: Drunk driving and related mortality show only minor associations with alcohol
  access at both age thresholds, with driving inexperience as dominant risk factor'
