- 'Step 1: Terminological and definitional problems create fundamental challenges
  in studying child maltreatment phenomena'
- 'Step 2: These definitional inconsistencies pose hurdles to estimating accurate
  epidemiological rates across studies and settings'
- 'Step 3: Wide variation in CM categorization despite relatively homogeneous definitions
  undermines comparability of prevalence data'
- 'Step 4: Unreliable epidemiological estimates compromise evidence base for policy
  decisions and resource allocation for child protection'
