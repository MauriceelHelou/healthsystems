direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Safety net policy creates disincentive for preemptive simultaneous liver-kidney
  transplants by guaranteeing kidney access post-liver transplant for appropriate
  candidates'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians reserve kidney organs for patients who definitively need them
  rather than transplanting kidneys prophylactically to patients who may recover kidney
  function'
- 'Step 3: Reduction in simultaneous liver-kidney transplants not clinically necessary
  decreases total kidney utilization'
- 'Step 4: Net kidney utilization (simultaneous liver-kidney plus kidney after liver)
  decreases from 1086 to 876 transplants in first year after liver transplant in 2019'
