to_node:
  node_id: ncd_mortality
  node_name: Non-Communicable Disease Mortality
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unhealthy commodity industries (tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed foods,
  gambling) engage in corporate political activity to stop governments from adopting
  effective public health policies'
- 'Step 2: CPA strategies include blocking access to policy-making, manufacturing
  doubt about evidence, and framing problems to favor industry interests'
- 'Step 3: Successful CPA prevents implementation of evidence-based public health
  policies that would reduce exposure to harmful products'
- 'Step 4: Continued exposure to unhealthy commodities (tobacco, alcohol, ultra-processed
  foods, gambling products) maintains or increases population risk'
- 'Step 5: Unregulated exposure to these products contributes to 41 million annual
  deaths from non-communicable diseases'
