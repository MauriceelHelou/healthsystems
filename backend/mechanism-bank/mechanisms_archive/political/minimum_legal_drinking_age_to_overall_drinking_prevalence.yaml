mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Raising minimum legal drinking age from 16 to 18 years creates legal barriers
  to alcohol purchase and access for adolescents'
- 'Step 2: Reduced legal access limits availability of alcohol to youth through retail
  and commercial channels'
- 'Step 3: Decreased availability translates to reduced opportunities for alcohol
  consumption among the restricted age group'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption opportunities result in measurable reduction in overall
  drinking prevalence among 16-18 year olds'
