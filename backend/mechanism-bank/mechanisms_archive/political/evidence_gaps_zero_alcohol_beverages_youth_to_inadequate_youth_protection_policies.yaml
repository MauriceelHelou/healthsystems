direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current paucity of research evidence on impact of zero-alcohol beverage
  consumption on youth drinking behaviors and social norms'
- 'Step 2: Lack of evidence creates barriers to developing evidence-based policies
  regulating availability and marketing to minors'
- 'Step 3: Absence of regulatory frameworks allows unrestricted sales and marketing
  of zero-alcohol beverages to youth populations'
- 'Step 4: Policy vacuum enables potential exposure pathways and gateway effects without
  protective safeguards for vulnerable youth populations'
