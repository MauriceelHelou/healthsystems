mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low enforcement of traffic rules creates permissive environment where risky
  driving behaviors are not deterred'
- 'Step 2: Drivers engage in dangerous behaviors including drunk driving and drowsy
  driving without consequence'
- 'Step 3: Unchecked dangerous driving behaviors lead to increased human errors on
  roads'
- 'Step 4: Human errors directly result in traffic crashes and fatalities'
