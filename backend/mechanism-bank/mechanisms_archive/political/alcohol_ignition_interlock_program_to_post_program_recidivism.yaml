category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Participation in interlock program creates extended period of monitored
  abstinence from impaired driving'
- 'Step 2: Program duration allows for habit formation and behavioral modification
  regarding drinking and driving decisions'
- 'Step 3: Educational components and monitoring create awareness of impaired driving
  risks'
- 'Step 4: Modified behaviors and risk perception persist after program completion'
- 'Step 5: Sustained behavior change results in reduced recidivism even after interlock
  device removal'
