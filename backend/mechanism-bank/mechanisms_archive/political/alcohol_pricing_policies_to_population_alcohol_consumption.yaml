direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of pricing policies (minimum unit pricing, targeted taxes
  on high-ABV products) increases retail prices of alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices create economic disincentives for alcohol purchase, particularly
  affecting heavy drinkers and price-sensitive populations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced affordability decreases volume and frequency of alcohol purchases
  across population'
- 'Step 4: Lower population-level consumption reduces alcohol-related health harms,
  hospitalizations, and mortality'
