category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal BAC limit is reduced from 0.8 to 0.5 mg/100ml through policy change
  in Scotland'
- 'Step 2: Lower legal limit would theoretically increase deterrence for moderate
  drinking before driving'
- 'Step 3: This should reduce the number of impaired drivers on roads, particularly
  those in the 0.5-0.8 range'
- 'Step 4: Fewer impaired drivers would be expected to reduce fatal crashes'
- 'Step 5: However, the study finds no measurable impact on traffic fatality rates,
  indicating the causal pathway did not function as hypothesized'
