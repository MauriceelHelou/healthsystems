direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permissive alcohol policies increase the number of retail outlets and hours
  of availability in communities'
- 'Step 2: Greater spatial and temporal availability reduces barriers to alcohol acquisition'
- 'Step 3: Increased availability normalizes alcohol consumption and creates more
  opportunities for initiation and sustained use'
- 'Step 4: Population-level alcohol consumption increases, particularly in communities
  with high outlet density'

  description: Low-income neighborhoods often have higher alcohol outlet density despite
    lower individual-level consumption resources, leading to greater exposure and
    normalized use patterns
