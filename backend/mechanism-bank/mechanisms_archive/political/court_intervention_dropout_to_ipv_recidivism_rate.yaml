direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dropout from court-mandated intervention programs leaves perpetrators without
  completed treatment for violence-related cognitive and behavioral patterns'
- 'Step 2: Untreated deficits in emotional information processing and behavioral regulation
  persist'
- 'Step 3: Absence of intervention effects on empathy, emotional decoding, and cognitive
  flexibility maintain violence risk factors'
- 'Step 4: Higher official recidivism rates observed during first year after intervention
  period, particularly among dropouts with high alcohol consumption'
