direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Time-based restrictions on alcohol sales create temporal windows during
  which additional alcohol cannot be legally purchased from convenient retail sources'
- 'Step 2: These restrictions particularly affect drinking episodes that begin earlier
  in the evening and might otherwise continue into late-night hours with additional
  alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 3: Limited ability to continue or escalate consumption during late-night hours
  prevents progression to dangerous levels of blood alcohol concentration'
- 'Step 4: Fewer instances of severe acute intoxication reduce the volume of emergency
  medical interventions and hospital admissions for alcohol poisoning'

  description: Effectiveness depends on retail compliance with time-based restrictions,
    which may vary by enforcement resources and regulatory oversight capacity.

  description: In border regions or areas with easy access to jurisdictions without
    time restrictions, consumers may travel to purchase alcohol, potentially weakening
    the policy effect.
