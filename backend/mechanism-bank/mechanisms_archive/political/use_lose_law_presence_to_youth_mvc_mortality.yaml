direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory license suspension laws create immediate, tangible consequences
  for underage alcohol violations that directly affect youth mobility and independence'
- 'Step 2: The direct connection between alcohol violations and loss of driving privileges
  serves as a deterrent mechanism independent of criminal justice involvement'
- 'Step 3: Youth awareness of automatic license suspension reduces both underage drinking
  behaviors and the likelihood of driving after any alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol-involved driving among inexperienced young drivers prevents
  motor vehicle collision fatalities'
