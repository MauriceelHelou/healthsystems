direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative reduction in bar/tavern operating hours (6am-2am to 9am-10pm)
  eliminates 7 hours of daily alcohol sales'
- 'Step 2: Restricted access to alcohol during late-night hours reduces opportunities
  for alcohol consumption during peak assault times'
- 'Step 3: Lower prevalence of acute alcohol intoxication during nighttime hours decreases
  aggression and impaired judgment in public spaces'
- 'Step 4: Reduced incidence of both aggravated and common assault near alcohol outlets
  during high-risk hours (8pm-4am)'
