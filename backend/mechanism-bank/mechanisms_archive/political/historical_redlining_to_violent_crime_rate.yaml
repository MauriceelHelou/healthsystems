direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Redlining systematically denied access to capital, mortgages, and investment
  in neighborhoods with residents of color, concentrating poverty and reducing resources'
- 'Step 2: Disinvestment led to deterioration of physical infrastructure, reduced
  employment opportunities, and elimination of community institutions'
- 'Step 3: Economic marginalization and reduced social cohesion created conditions
  of concentrated disadvantage'
- 'Step 4: Structural disadvantage increased community stress, reduced protective
  factors, and created environmental conditions conducive to violence'
- 'Step 5: Amplification effect: redlined communities became more vulnerable to additional
  risk factors like alcohol outlet density'
