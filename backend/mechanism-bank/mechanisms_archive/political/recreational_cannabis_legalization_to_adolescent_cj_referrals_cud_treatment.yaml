direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recreational cannabis legalization changes social and enforcement norms
  around cannabis use'
- 'Step 2: Law enforcement may reduce enforcement efforts for adolescent cannabis
  offenses in legalized states'
- 'Step 3: Reduced enforcement leads to fewer adolescent arrests for cannabis-related
  offenses'
- 'Step 4: Fewer arrests result in declining court-mandated referrals to CUD treatment
  for adolescents'

  description: Effect is not statistically significant for adolescents (12-17 years)
    unlike young adults, possibly because cannabis remains illegal for minors regardless
    of legalization status
