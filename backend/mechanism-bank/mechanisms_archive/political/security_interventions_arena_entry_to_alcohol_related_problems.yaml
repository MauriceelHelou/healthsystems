mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Security staff trained to identify intoxication implement standardized
  screening at arena entrances'
- 'Step 2: Denial of entry to severely intoxicated individuals prevents concentration
  of highly intoxicated patrons inside venues'
- 'Step 3: Reduced presence of intoxicated spectators inside arenas limits opportunities
  for alcohol-related incidents and conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Lower density of intoxicated individuals decreases overall alcohol-related
  problems including disturbances, injuries, and violence'
