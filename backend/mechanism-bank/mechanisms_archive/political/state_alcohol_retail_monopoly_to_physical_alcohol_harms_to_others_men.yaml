direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State monopoly systems limit commercial incentives to maximize alcohol
  sales and restrict aggressive marketing practices'
- 'Step 2: Government control prioritizes public health over profit, leading to more
  conservative alcohol availability policies'
- 'Step 3: Reduced overall alcohol consumption and heavy drinking episodes among male
  population'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of alcohol-related violence, assault, and property damage perpetrated
  by intoxicated men'

  description: Effect among men (55% reduction, aOR=0.45) was substantially stronger
    than overall population effect (41% reduction, aOR=0.59), suggesting men's consumption
    patterns are more responsive to structural availability constraints
