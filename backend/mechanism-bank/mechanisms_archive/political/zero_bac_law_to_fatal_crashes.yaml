  node_name: Fatal Traffic Crashes
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zero-BAC law eliminates legal tolerance for any alcohol consumption before
  driving'
- 'Step 2: Legal threshold change creates deterrent effect and reduces drunk driving
  behavior through enforcement threat'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving decreases severe crash risk'
- 'Step 4: Lower frequency of high-severity crashes results in fewer fatal traffic
  crashes'
