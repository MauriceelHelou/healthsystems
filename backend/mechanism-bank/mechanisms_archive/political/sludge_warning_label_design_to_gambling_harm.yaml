direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gambling operators use sludge strategies including confusing message framing,
  small font sizes, and placement on obscure help screens for required warning labels'
- 'Step 2: These design choices hamper decision-making and reduce comprehension of
  gambling odds and risks'
- 'Step 3: Consumers are poorly informed about the true odds they face when gambling'
- 'Step 4: Without clear understanding of risks, individuals continue gambling behaviors
  that lead to financial losses exceeding what they can afford'
