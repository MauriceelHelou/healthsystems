direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zero tolerance law decreases legal blood alcohol concentration threshold
  for drivers'
- 'Step 2: Lower BAC threshold creates deterrent effect through increased risk of
  legal penalties for impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: Reduced prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving on roadways'
- 'Step 4: Decreased frequency and severity of alcohol-related traffic crashes, fatalities
  and injuries'
