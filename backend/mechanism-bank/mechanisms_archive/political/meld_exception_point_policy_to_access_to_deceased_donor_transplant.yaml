direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MELD exception point policies determine which hepatocellular carcinoma
  patients receive priority for deceased donor liver allocation'
- 'Step 2: Current policy restricts exception points to patients meeting narrow selection
  criteria (Milan criteria)'
- 'Step 3: Patients exceeding these criteria cannot receive exception points despite
  similar outcomes with expanded criteria'
- 'Step 4: Policy expansion to include broader criteria (Metroticket 2.0, UCSF, U7)
  would enable more patients to receive exception points and access transplantation'
