direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IID mandate policy requires device installation for DWI-convicted drivers
  as condition for license reinstatement'
- 'Step 2: Policy implementation without addressing financial and informational barriers
  creates differential compliance'
- 'Step 3: Drivers unable to comply due to economic constraints or institutional mistrust
  select license suspension alternative'
- 'Step 4: Non-installers represent concentrated high-risk subsample operating outside
  the safety monitoring system'
- 'Step 5: This subsample faces compounded risks: original DWI behavior plus unlicensed
  driving plus no technological intervention'
