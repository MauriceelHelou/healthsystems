mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing First provides immediate access to independent housing without
  requiring treatment compliance or sobriety as preconditions'
- 'Step 2: Housing subsidies remove financial barriers to accessing and maintaining
  stable housing'
- 'Step 3: Integrated support services address mental health needs while individuals
  are housed, reducing risk of housing loss'
- 'Step 4: Sustained housing is achieved through combination of reduced economic barriers
  and ongoing support that addresses underlying mental health conditions'
