mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Police agencies conduct enforcement targeting bars and restaurants that
  serve alcohol to already intoxicated patrons (overservice)'
- 'Step 2: Enforcement creates deterrent effect on establishments, reducing likelihood
  of serving intoxicated customers'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol overservice decreases the number of highly intoxicated
  individuals driving from bars/restaurants'
- 'Step 4: Fewer alcohol-impaired drivers on roads results in reduction of fatal traffic
  crashes involving drivers with BAC ≥0.08'
