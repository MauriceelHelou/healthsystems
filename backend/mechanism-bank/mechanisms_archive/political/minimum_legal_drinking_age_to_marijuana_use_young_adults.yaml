direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Before reaching MLDA, young people face legal barriers to alcohol access'
- 'Step 2: Limited alcohol availability may drive some youth toward alternative substances
  like marijuana as substitutes'
- 'Step 3: Upon reaching age 21, legal alcohol becomes more accessible and socially
  acceptable'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol availability reduces relative demand for marijuana as
  a substitute substance'
- 'Step 5: This substitution effect results in decreased marijuana use after reaching
  MLDA'
