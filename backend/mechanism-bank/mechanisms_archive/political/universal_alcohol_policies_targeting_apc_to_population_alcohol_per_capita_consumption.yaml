direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universal policies (pricing, availability restrictions, marketing controls)
  reduce alcohol accessibility and affordability across the population'
- 'Step 2: These structural changes affect drinking behavior across the entire consumption
  distribution, not just among heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Reduced consumption among both moderate and heavy drinkers shifts the entire
  population distribution downward'
- 'Step 4: Population mean consumption (APC) decreases as a result of the downward
  shift in the consumption distribution'
