direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative restrictions limit the hours during which on-premise alcohol
  outlets (bars, hotels) can sell alcohol late at night'
- 'Step 2: Reduced availability of alcohol during late-night hours decreases the temporal
  window for alcohol consumption in high-risk environments'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of late-night alcohol consumption and intoxication reduce the
  likelihood of violence-related incidents'
- 'Step 4: Decreased congregations of intoxicated individuals in entertainment districts
  during peak violence hours leads to measurable reductions in assault rates'
