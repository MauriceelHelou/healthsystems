- 'Step 1: Minimum legal drinking age restricts legal alcohol access for those under
  21'
- 'Step 2: Reaching age 21 increases alcohol availability and social acceptability
  of alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Greater alcohol availability enables increased simultaneous or sequential
  use of both substances'
- 'Step 4: Combined use patterns increase as legal alcohol becomes accessible while
  marijuana remains available through existing channels'
- 'Step 5: Polysubstance use is reflected in toxicological testing showing both substances
  present'
