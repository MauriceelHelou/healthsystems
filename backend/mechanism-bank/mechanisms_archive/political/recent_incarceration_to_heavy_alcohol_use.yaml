- 'Step 1: Incarceration disrupts social networks, employment, and housing stability
  for people living with HIV who use drugs'
- 'Step 2: Post-release environments often lack adequate support services and reintegration
  programs, creating social isolation'
- 'Step 3: Trauma and stress from incarceration experience, combined with limited
  coping resources, increases vulnerability to substance use'
- 'Step 4: Restricted access to substance use treatment and harm reduction services
  during and after incarceration removes protective factors'
- 'Step 5: Heavy alcohol use emerges as coping mechanism for post-incarceration stressors
  and unmet mental health needs'
