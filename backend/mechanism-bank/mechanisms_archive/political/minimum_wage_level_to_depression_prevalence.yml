mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum wage increases raise income for low-wage workers, reducing economic precarity and financial stress'
- 'Step 2: Higher wages reduce the need for multiple jobs, excessive work hours, and economic insecurity'
- 'Step 3: Improved financial stability reduces chronic stress, anxiety about basic needs, and sense of deprivation'
- 'Step 4: Better material conditions enable investment in social activities, healthcare, and self-care'
- 'Step 5: Reduced chronic economic stress leads to lower rates of depression and improved mental wellbeing'

description: Minimum wage increases are associated with reduced depressive symptoms among low-wage workers. The UK quasi-natural experiment of the 1999 national minimum wage introduction found sustained reductions in depression measured by GHQ-12. A 2024 review found somewhat more studies reporting positive mental health impacts than no impact, with none finding negative impacts. Higher minimum wages have also been associated with reduced suicide rates, consistent with mental health benefits.

structural_competency:

  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Depression among low-wage workers reflects material conditions created by wage policy, not individual vulnerability. Minimum wage policy is a structural intervention that addresses economic determinants of mental health. Disproportionately affects women, minorities, and young workers in low-wage sectors.
assumptions:
- Assumes wage increases improve material conditions for low-wage workers
- Assumes financial stress is a significant contributor to depression
- Assumes employment effects do not offset income effects
limitations:
- Most evidence is observational; causation difficult to establish
- UK natural experiment may not generalize to US context
- Employment effects of minimum wage remain debated
- Effect sizes vary across studies and populations
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects depend on baseline wages, cost of living, and social safety net generosity
  relevant_geographies:
  - Effects stronger in areas with lower baseline wages
  - High cost-of-living areas may see smaller effects as wage gains absorbed by expenses
  - Countries with stronger social safety nets may show smaller marginal effects
