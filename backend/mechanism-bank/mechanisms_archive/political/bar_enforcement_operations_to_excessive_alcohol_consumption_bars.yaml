direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Undercover enforcement operations target bars and establishments serving
  alcohol to already intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 2: Enforcement actions create compliance pressure on alcohol vendors to refuse
  service to intoxicated individuals'
- 'Step 3: Reduced service to intoxicated patrons limits opportunities for excessive
  alcohol consumption before driving'
- 'Step 4: Lower blood alcohol concentrations among bar patrons who drive reduce likelihood
  of impairment and crash risk'
