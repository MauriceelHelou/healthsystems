direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Despite interlock effectiveness, actual use among convicted DWI offenders
  remains low due to weak enforcement or limited mandatory requirements'
- 'Step 2: Low installation rates create enforcement gaps where convicted offenders
  continue driving without technological prevention'
- 'Step 3: Absence of physical barrier allows continued access to vehicle operation
  while impaired'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate policy coverage or enforcement enables higher rates of repeat
  alcohol-impaired driving'
