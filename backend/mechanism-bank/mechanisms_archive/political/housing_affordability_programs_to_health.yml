mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing affordability programs (vouchers, subsidies, assistance) reduce housing cost burden'
- 'Step 2: Reduced housing cost burden prevents forced moves, eviction filings, and homelessness'
- 'Step 3: Housing stability enables consistent healthcare access, medication adherence, and care continuity'
- 'Step 4: Freed household resources allow investment in food security, healthcare, and other health inputs'
- 'Step 5: Reduced housing stress improves mental health, sleep quality, and chronic disease management'

description: Interventions that promote housing affordability and stability upstream of homelessness are
  associated with improved health outcomes. Housing assistance programs reduce emergency department visits,
  improve chronic disease management, and enhance mental health by addressing the fundamental housing
  insecurity that drives health disparities.

structural_competency:

  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Housing affordability programs represent structural intervention addressing root
    causes of housing insecurity. These programs counteract market failures, discriminatory housing practices,
    and inadequate wages that create housing instability. Expanding these programs is a policy choice
    that can reduce health inequities driven by housing insecurity.
assumptions:
- Programs provide meaningful, sustained housing affordability improvement
- Health outcomes measured across multiple domains (ED visits, chronic disease, mental health)
- Comparison is to similar populations without housing assistance
limitations:
- Selection effects in program participation may bias observational results
- Housing assistance wait lists mean many eligible households don't receive support
- Health impacts may take years to fully manifest
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Housing costs, program availability, and market conditions vary dramatically across
    regions, affecting mechanism strength.
  relevant_geographies:
  - High-cost metros show larger potential health gains from housing assistance
  - Rural areas may face housing quality issues not addressed by affordability alone
  - States with robust housing programs show population health benefits
