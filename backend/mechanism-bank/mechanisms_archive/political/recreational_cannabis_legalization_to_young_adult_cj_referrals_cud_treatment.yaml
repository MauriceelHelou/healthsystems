direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recreational cannabis legalization decriminalizes cannabis possession and
  use for adults'
- 'Step 2: Decriminalization reduces cannabis-related arrests among young adults (18-24
  years)'
- 'Step 3: Fewer arrests result in fewer court-mandated referrals to cannabis use
  disorder treatment'
- 'Step 4: The proportion of criminal justice referrals to CUD treatment declines
  relative to other referral sources'

  description: Effect is statistically significant for young adults (18-24 years)
    but not for adolescents (12-17 years), likely because legalization specifically
    decriminalizes adult use
