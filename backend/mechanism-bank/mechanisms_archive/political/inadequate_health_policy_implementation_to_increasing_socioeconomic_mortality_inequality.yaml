- 'Step 1: Health policies fail to adequately target structural determinants of health
  inequalities'
- 'Step 2: Policy implementation does not reach or benefit lower-income populations
  proportionally'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare system improvements disproportionately benefit higher-income
  groups who can better navigate and access services'
- 'Step 4: Absence of effective policies to address alcohol harm, healthcare access
  barriers, and cardiovascular risk in disadvantaged populations'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative policy failures allow socioeconomic mortality gaps to widen
  over time'
