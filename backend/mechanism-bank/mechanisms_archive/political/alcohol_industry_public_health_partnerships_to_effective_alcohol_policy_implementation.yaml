direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry-funded organizations (e.g., Drinkaware) establish formal
  partnerships with government health departments (e.g., Public Health England)'
- 'Step 2: These partnerships create organizational conflicts of interest that constrain
  policy options and marginalize independent civil society voices in policy development'
- 'Step 3: Industry-funded campaigns displace more effective population-level policy
  interventions that might affect alcohol sales'
- 'Step 4: Strategic alignment between partnerships and wider industry lobbying activities
  weakens comprehensive alcohol control measures'
- 'Step 5: Reduced implementation of evidence-based alcohol policies leads to sustained
  higher levels of alcohol-related harm at population level'
