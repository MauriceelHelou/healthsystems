  node_name: Inadequate Protection of Youth from Alcohol Marketing
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry administers self-regulatory codes (ABAC) with inherent
  conflict of interest between profit motives and public health protection'
- 'Step 2: Industry-designed codes use narrow definitions and loopholes that fail
  to capture harmful advertising practices, evidenced by 36% ABAC violation rate versus
  94% AARB Code violation rate'
- 'Step 3: Self-regulatory enforcement lacks independent oversight and meaningful
  penalties for non-compliance'
- 'Step 4: Weak regulatory framework allows continued youth exposure to alcohol advertising
  that would be restricted under evidence-based mandatory regulation'
