direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pictorial warning labels on cigarette packs increase exposure to visual
  health risk information among non-smokers, particularly young adults'
- 'Step 2: PWLs add new information about tobacco-related health consequences and
  evoke fear responses regarding smoking risks'
- 'Step 3: Fear evocation and health risk awareness create negative associations with
  smoking initiation'
- 'Step 4: These negative cognitive and emotional associations motivate non-smokers
  to remain smoke-free and deter experimental smoking'
