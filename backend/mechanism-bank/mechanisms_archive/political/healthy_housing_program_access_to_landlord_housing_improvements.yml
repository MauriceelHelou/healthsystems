  description: Landlord responsiveness to advocacy may depend on local rental market conditions and tenant
    bargaining power
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes power imbalances between landlords and tenants, particularly
    low-income renters with limited housing options. The advocacy component addresses structural inequities
    in rental housing by providing institutional support for tenant rights. This challenges the individualization
    of housing problems and provides collective resources to address landlord accountability.
