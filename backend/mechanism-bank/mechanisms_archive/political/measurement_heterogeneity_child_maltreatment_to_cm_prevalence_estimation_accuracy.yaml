direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different age groups, methods, and instruments used across studies create
  inconsistent measurement approaches'
- 'Step 2: Wide variation in CM categorization makes it difficult to compare results
  across contexts and populations'
- 'Step 3: Lack of standardized measurement leads to widely varying prevalence estimates
  that obscure true burden'
- 'Step 4: Inaccurate epidemiological data undermines ability to allocate resources
  and design effective public health interventions'
