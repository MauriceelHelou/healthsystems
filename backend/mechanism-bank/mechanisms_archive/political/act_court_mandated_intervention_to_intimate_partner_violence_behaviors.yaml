direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court mandates offenders to complete 24 sessions of ACT-based group intervention
  in community corrections setting'
- 'Step 2: ACT intervention develops psychological flexibility, reducing rigid behavioral
  patterns and experiential avoidance that contribute to relationship conflict'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced emotional regulation and values-based responding reduces perpetration
  of aggression, controlling behaviors, and stalking/harassment'
- 'Step 4: Victims report fewer IPV behaviors across multiple validated measures at
  1-year follow-up'

  description: Victim reports showed large effect sizes (d=0.78 for aggression) while
    criminal charges showed non-significant differences for domestic assault, suggesting
    victim-reported outcomes capture IPV behaviors more sensitively
