mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability (high rent burden, frequent moves, eviction threat) creates chronic stress
  and insecurity'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing disrupts social networks, employment stability, and access to healthcare and
  services'
- 'Step 3: Material hardship from prioritizing rent over other needs (food, healthcare) increases deprivation
  and stress'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol use increases as coping mechanism for housing-related stress, anxiety, and sense of
  failure'
- 'Step 5: Escalating drinking impairs housing stability through missed rent, eviction, and homelessness,
  creating downward spiral to AUD'

  equity_implications: 'Housing instability is not individual failure but the predictable result of policy
    choices about housing as commodity versus human right. Decades of declining affordable housing production,
    wage stagnation, and financialization of housing have created a crisis where half of renters are cost-burdened.
    Communities of color face discriminatory lending, displacement through gentrification, and concentrated
    eviction filing. The housing-AUD pathway reflects how structural violence—policy-driven housing unaffordability—produces
    health harm. Eviction operates as social determinant concentrating in Black women-headed households
    in specific zip codes. High AUD in housing-unstable populations represents coping with manufactured
    scarcity. Addressing this requires transformative housing policy: social housing production, rent
    control, universal housing vouchers, eviction prevention, and challenging housing as profit vehicle
    rather than secure foundation for health.'
assumptions:
- Housing instability includes rent burden >30% income, frequent moves, doubled up housing, eviction
- Mechanism operates through both material deprivation and psychosocial stress
- Assumes competitive rental market with limited affordable options
limitations:
- Bidirectionality exists (AUD can also cause housing instability)
- Individual social capital and resources create variability in outcomes
- Housing instability severity ranges from rent burden to literal homelessness with different health impacts
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Housing affordability crisis varies by market dynamics, rent control policies, and
    housing assistance availability
  relevant_geographies:
  - High-cost coastal cities show severe rent burden but more robust tenant protections in some cases
  - Eviction hotspots concentrate in specific neighborhoods, often communities of color in Sun Belt cities
  - Rural areas have limited rental stock and few housing assistance options
  - Cities with strong tenant protections, rent control, and housing voucher access buffer instability
