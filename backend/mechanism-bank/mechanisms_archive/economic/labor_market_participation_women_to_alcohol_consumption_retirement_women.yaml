direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical increase in women''s labor market participation, particularly
  in higher status occupations, creates cohorts of women with strong professional
  identities and role investments'
- 'Step 2: Greater labor market activity provides women with independent financial
  resources not available to previous cohorts'
- 'Step 3: Higher status job occupation leads to larger role loss and identity disruption
  upon retirement for women in current cohorts'
- 'Step 4: Combination of financial resources and role loss creates conditions for
  increased alcohol consumption post-retirement among women with higher education'
