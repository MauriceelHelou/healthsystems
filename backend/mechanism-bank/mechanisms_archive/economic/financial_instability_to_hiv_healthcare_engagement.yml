  equity_implications: This mechanism links financial instability to broader structural inequities including
    employment discrimination, inadequate social safety nets, and economic policies that disproportionately
    affect ACB communities. It avoids individual blame by focusing on systemic economic barriers and highlights
    the need for structural economic interventions to support health equity.
