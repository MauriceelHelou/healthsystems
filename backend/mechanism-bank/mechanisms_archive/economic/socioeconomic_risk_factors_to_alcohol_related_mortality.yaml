direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic disadvantage creates chronic stress and reduced access to
  health-protective resources'
- 'Step 2: Lower socioeconomic status is associated with reduced capacity to buffer
  against physiological damage from alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Economic constraints may lead to consumption of lower-quality alcohol products
  or drinking patterns that amplify health risks'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to healthcare and preventive services among socioeconomically
  disadvantaged groups delays detection and treatment of alcohol-related conditions'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative disadvantage across life course creates biological vulnerability
  that interacts with even low-risk drinking to increase mortality'

moderators:
- name: wine_preference
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Wine preference was associated with attenuating the excess mortality
    associated with alcohol consumption, potentially reflecting both beverage-specific
    protective compounds and socioeconomic patterning of wine consumption
- name: drinking_only_with_meals
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Drinking only with meals was associated with attenuating excess mortality,
    suggesting that drinking context and patterns can modify harm even among those
    with risk factors
