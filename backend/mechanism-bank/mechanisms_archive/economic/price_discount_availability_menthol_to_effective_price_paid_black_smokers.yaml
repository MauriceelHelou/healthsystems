direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black smokers receive significantly more price discounts for menthol products
  than white menthol smokers'
- 'Step 2: Price promotions reduce the effective retail price paid by Black consumers
  relative to pre-discount prices'
- 'Step 3: Lower effective prices partially offset cigarette tax increases for Black
  menthol smokers'
- 'Step 4: Black smokers pay lower net prices for menthol cigarettes compared to what
  would be expected based on tax rates alone'
