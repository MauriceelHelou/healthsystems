- 'Step 1: High housing costs force families to spend disproportionate income on rent'
- 'Step 2: Limited remaining income reduces ability to afford asthma medications and preventive healthcare'
- 'Step 3: Financial stress leads families to delay or skip medical appointments and medication refills'
- 'Step 4: Unmanaged asthma symptoms worsen over time'
- 'Step 5: Increased frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations requiring emergency intervention'

description: High housing costs create financial constraints that limit families' ability to afford asthma
  medications and preventive care, leading to increased asthma exacerbations in children.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects concentrated in hyper-local neighborhoods on South Side of Chicago, suggesting
    spatial clustering of housing affordability challenges
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural housing policy failures including lack of affordable
    housing supply, weak rent stabilization policies, and insufficient housing subsidies. Housing cost
    burden disproportionately affects Black and Latino families due to residential segregation and wage
    inequality, creating racialized health disparities.
