direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol prices create economic barriers that reduce affordability
  of alcohol products for youth with limited financial resources'
- 'Step 2: Reduced affordability and access to alcohol delays opportunities for experimentation
  and first alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Economic constraints disproportionately affect youth who depend on limited
  allowances or part-time work income'
- 'Step 4: Price increases function as structural barrier that delays age of first
  alcohol exposure'
