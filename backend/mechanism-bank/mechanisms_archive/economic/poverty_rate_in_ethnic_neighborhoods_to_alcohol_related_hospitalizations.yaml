  node_id: alcohol_related_hospitalizations

direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher poverty in ethnic enclaves concentrates residents with limited economic
  mobility, maintaining stronger reliance on ethnic community networks and institutions'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraint limits geographic mobility and exposure to mainstream
  social environments where different alcohol norms prevail'
- 'Step 3: Poverty-driven residential stability in ethnic enclaves strengthens long-term
  community ties and intergenerational transmission of protective cultural values'
- 'Step 4: Limited economic resources may paradoxically reduce access to environments
  where heavy alcohol consumption is normalized or marketed'
