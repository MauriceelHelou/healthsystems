direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption creates stigma and visible health consequences
  that employers screen for during hiring processes'
- 'Step 2: Medium and high-educated positions involve more extensive screening, including
  interviews, reference checks, and assessment of professional presentation'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related health problems, gaps in employment history, or behavioral
  indicators reduce competitiveness in selective hiring processes for professional
  positions'
- 'Step 4: Unemployed individuals with alcohol problems face reduced probability of
  successful job market re-entry in positions matching their educational credentials'
