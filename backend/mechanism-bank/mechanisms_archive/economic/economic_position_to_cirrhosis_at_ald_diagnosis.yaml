  node_name: Advanced Disease Stage at ALD Diagnosis
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower socioeconomic position reduces engagement with preventive primary
  care services due to work inflexibility, transportation barriers, and competing
  survival priorities'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare systems may provide differential quality of screening and early
  detection based on patient socioeconomic characteristics (implicit bias)'
- 'Step 3: Lack of resources delays help-seeking behavior until symptoms become severe
  and unavoidable'
- 'Step 4: By the time of diagnosis, disease has progressed to more advanced stages
  such as cirrhosis, limiting treatment options and worsening prognosis'
