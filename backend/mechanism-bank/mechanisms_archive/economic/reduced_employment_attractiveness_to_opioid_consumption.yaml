direction: positive
category: economic

- 'Step 1: Unemployment bonuses reduce the wage premium for employment, making work
  financially less attractive'
- 'Step 2: Reduced employment returns lower the opportunity cost (full price) of time-intensive
  activities like drug use'
- 'Step 3: Lower opportunity costs reduce marginal opioid prices through both wage
  effects and induced substitution to cheaper fentanyl'
- 'Step 4: Reduced effective prices increase opioid consumption and associated harms'
