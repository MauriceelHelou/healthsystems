direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower household assets limit financial resources available for transportation
  to distant health facilities'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints make free or low-cost CHW services in the community
  more financially accessible than facility-based care'
- 'Step 3: Reduced transportation costs and no facility user fees increase feasibility
  of seeking care from CHWs'
- 'Step 4: Economic accessibility drives higher CHW service utilization among lower-income
  households'
