  node_name: Involvement in Begging
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP policy increases minimum price of alcohol, raising costs for people
  with experience of homelessness who consume alcohol'
- 'Step 2: People experiencing homelessness face increased economic strain to maintain
  alcohol consumption with fixed or limited income'
- 'Step 3: Lack of alternative income sources and housing instability limit options
  for generating additional funds'
- 'Step 4: Minority of participants resort to increased begging as survival strategy
  to offset higher alcohol costs'
