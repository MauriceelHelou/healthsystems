direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permanent day shift employment structures create continuous exposure to
  workplace stressors without the temporal relief provided by rotating schedules'
- 'Step 2: Sustained exposure to work-related stress without variation in work patterns
  leads to chronic stress accumulation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic occupational stress impairs cognitive function, concentration,
  and work performance'
- 'Step 4: Reduced work performance manifests as measurable productivity impairment
  with associated economic costs exceeding $50,000 per employee annually'
