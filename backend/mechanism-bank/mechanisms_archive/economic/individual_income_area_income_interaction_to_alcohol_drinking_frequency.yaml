direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower-income individuals living in high-income areas experience relative
  deprivation and social comparison stress'
- 'Step 2: High-income neighborhood contexts have strong pro-drinking social norms
  and alcohol-centric social activities'
- 'Step 3: Lower-income residents may increase drinking frequency to participate in
  neighborhood social life and reduce feelings of exclusion'
- 'Step 4: Economic strain combined with pressure to conform to affluent drinking
  patterns increases consumption among lower-income residents in wealthy areas'
