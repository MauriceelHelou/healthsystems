mechanism_pathway:
  - "Step 1: Housing costs exceeding 30% of household income create financial strain"
  - "Step 2: Housing cost burden forces tradeoffs with other essential needs (food, healthcare, medications)"
  - "Step 3: Chronic financial stress from housing costs activates sustained stress response"
  - "Step 4: Uncertainty about housing stability (fear of eviction, inability to pay rent) creates anticipatory anxiety"
  - "Step 5: Cost burden may force housing instability, moves to poorer quality housing, or overcrowding"
  - "Step 6: Cumulative material hardship and psychological stress dysregulate HPA axis and increase inflammation"
  - "Step 7: Sustained housing-related stress manifests as depressive symptoms and major depression"

  interpretation: "Housing cost burden significantly increases depression risk through multiple pathways. Mortgage delinquency increases depression odds 8.6-fold. Severe housing cost burden (>50% income) among older renters doubles odds of functional decline. Longitudinal UK study of 30,000 households shows persistent housing affordability problems predict worse mental health over 9 years. Effects particularly strong for renters and younger adults."

description: "Housing cost burden is associated with increased depression through chronic financial stress, uncertainty, and tradeoffs with other health-promoting expenditures. Studies show mortgage delinquency increases depression odds 8.6-fold, while persistent housing cost burden predicts worse mental health over time. Renters and low-income populations are most affected. The relationship is bidirectional, with depression also contributing to housing instability."

structural_competency:

  equity_implications: "Housing cost burden reflects structural factors: wage stagnation relative to housing costs, inadequate housing supply, zoning restrictions limiting affordable housing, insufficient housing subsidies, and discriminatory lending/renting practices. Nearly half of US renters are cost-burdened. Low-income households, racial minorities, and single-parent families face highest rates. Policy solutions require housing supply interventions, rent assistance expansion, zoning reform, and wage policies rather than individual financial counseling."
assumptions:
  - "Housing cost burden defined as spending 30%+ of income on housing costs"
  - "Severe burden defined as 50%+ of income"
  - "Depression measured via validated screening instruments"
limitations:
  - "Heterogeneity in measurement across studies prevents meta-analysis"
  - "Bidirectional relationship (depression may cause housing problems)"
  - "Residual confounding by income, employment, and other economic factors"
  - "Cross-sectional studies cannot establish causation"
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: "Housing cost burden varies dramatically by metropolitan area. Coastal cities (SF, NYC, LA, Boston) show highest burden rates. Effects may be stronger in high-cost markets where burden extends to middle-income households. Rural areas show different patterns with lower costs but also lower incomes."
