direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public housing policies concentrate low-income families in high-poverty
  census tracts'
- 'Step 2: High-poverty neighborhoods experience different patterns of commercial
  development and alcohol licensing'
- 'Step 3: Economic disinvestment and zoning practices shape the density and type
  of alcohol outlets in high-poverty areas'
- 'Step 4: Resulting alcohol retail environment configurations create differential
  exposure to off-premises vs on-premises outlets by neighborhood poverty level'

  description: Low-poverty vouchers (restricted to <10% poverty neighborhoods) may
    have led to different outlet environment exposure compared to unrestricted vouchers,
    though groups were pooled for analysis
