  node_id: episodic_heavy_drinking
  node_name: Episodic Heavy Drinking
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic crisis increases job insecurity and reduces re-employment opportunities,
  amplifying financial strain and psychological distress associated with job loss'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged unemployment (>6 months) during crisis periods leads to accumulated
  stress, loss of social networks, and erosion of daily structure'
- 'Step 3: Increased psychological distress and reduced coping resources lead to episodic
  heavy drinking as a stress response mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Economic crisis context reduces access to mental health services and social
  support systems that might buffer against harmful drinking'
