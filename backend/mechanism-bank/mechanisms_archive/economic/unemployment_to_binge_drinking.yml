- 'Step 1: Job loss causes acute psychological distress including loss of identity, purpose, and social
  status'
- 'Step 2: Economic strain from unemployment creates financial stress, housing insecurity, and inability
  to meet basic needs'
- 'Step 3: Loss of structured time and workplace social connections increases isolation and lack of routine'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol use increases as accessible coping mechanism for stress, shame, and hopelessness during
  unemployment'
- 'Step 5: Binge drinking episodes escalate as unemployment persists, creating barriers to reemployment
  and worsening outcomes'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: economic_system
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Unemployment is not individual failure but reflects economic system dynamics including
    deindustrialization, automation, discrimination, and inadequate labor protections. Job loss concentrates
    in communities experiencing economic restructuring and disinvestment. Workers of color face higher
    unemployment and longer durations due to discrimination. The unemployment-drinking pathway reflects
    how economic systems generate health harm through insecurity and deprivation. Nations with strong
    social safety nets show minimal unemployment-health gradients, proving the relationship is mediated
    by policy choices about economic support. High drinking among unemployed populations represents rational
    response to structural abandonment. Addressing this requires full employment policies, living wages,
    robust unemployment insurance, job retraining, and universal healthcare that breaks the link between
    employment and survival.
assumptions:
- Unemployment refers to involuntary job loss or inability to find employment
- Mechanism operates through both economic strain and psychosocial stress pathways
- Assumes limited social safety net support
limitations:
- Selection effects exist (heavy drinkers may be more likely to lose jobs)
- Individual coping resources and circumstances create variability in response
- Some individuals reduce drinking during unemployment due to financial constraints
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Unemployment rates and impacts vary by local labor markets, industry composition, and
    safety net generosity
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rust Belt regions with deindustrialization show persistent unemployment and elevated substance use
  - Rural areas with limited economic diversity face concentrated job loss from single industry decline
  - Urban areas with job growth but spatial mismatch leave certain neighborhoods with high unemployment
  - States with generous unemployment benefits and Medicaid expansion buffer health impacts of job loss
