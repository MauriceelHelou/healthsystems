mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Receiving eviction notice or threat creates acute psychological distress and fear of displacement'
- 'Step 2: Uncertainty about housing future generates chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels'
- 'Step 3: Social disruption anticipation causes anxiety about losing community, schools, and support
  networks'
- 'Step 4: Financial strain from legal fees, moving costs, and potential job loss compounds psychological
  burden'
- 'Step 5: Prolonged housing instability stress manifests as depression, anxiety disorders, and trauma
  symptoms'

description: Eviction threat and housing instability are significant stressors that negatively impact
  mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, and psychological distress. Research shows elevated
  cortisol levels among those facing foreclosure and housing loss, indicating physiological stress response.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: economic_system
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Eviction disproportionately affects low-income renters, Black and Latino households,
    and single mothers due to structural factors including wage stagnation, discrimination, and inadequate
    housing assistance. The mental health consequences reflect systemic housing policy failures, not individual
    shortcomings. Just-cause eviction protections and rental assistance address root causes.
assumptions:
- Eviction threat includes formal notice, court filing, or credible threat of displacement
- Mental health outcomes measured through validated instruments (PHQ, GAD, etc.)
- Mechanism applies to both actual eviction and threat/instability
limitations:
- Most studies are observational with limited causal inference
- Difficult to separate eviction effects from underlying poverty effects
- Mental health problems may also contribute to eviction risk (bidirectionality)
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Eviction rates and protections vary substantially by jurisdiction. States with strong
    tenant protections show lower eviction-related mental health impacts.
  relevant_geographies:
  - High-cost urban areas show elevated eviction-related stress
  - States without just-cause eviction protections have higher displacement rates
  - Areas with legal aid programs show better tenant outcomes
