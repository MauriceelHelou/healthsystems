direction: positive
category: economic

- 'Step 1: Industry asserts that minimum unit pricing and taxation policies are not
  needed, using manipulated evidence in policy submissions'
- 'Step 2: Opposition prevents or delays implementation of pricing policies that would
  increase cost of alcohol products'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol remains highly affordable relative to income, particularly for
  cheap high-strength products'
- 'Step 4: High affordability maintains elevated consumption levels, particularly
  among heavier drinkers and those using cheap products, perpetuating alcohol-related
  harms'
