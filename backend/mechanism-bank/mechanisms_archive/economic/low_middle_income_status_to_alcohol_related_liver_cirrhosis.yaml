mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower and middle-income populations have disproportionate representation
  in patient cohort (mean age 46.66±10.21 and 47.14±6.36 years)'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints limit access to early screening, alcohol use disorder
  treatment, and preventive hepatology care'
- 'Step 3: Lack of resources for regular medical monitoring allows undetected progression
  from fatty liver to cirrhosis over 14+ years of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: By the time patients present to medical care, liver cirrhosis has already
  progressed to severe complications including hepatic encephalopathy with cognitive
  impairment'
