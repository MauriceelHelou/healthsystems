  node_id: nitrogen_cycle_disruption
  node_name: Global Nitrogen Cycle Disruption
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Livestock production requires substantial nitrogen inputs for feed crop
  production through synthetic fertilizers'
- 'Step 2: Manure from livestock operations contains high concentrations of reactive
  nitrogen compounds'
- 'Step 3: Excess nitrogen leaches into waterways causing eutrophication and contaminates
  groundwater with nitrates'
- 'Step 4: Water contamination creates health risks including methemoglobinemia (blue
  baby syndrome) and potential cancer risks, while air pollution from nitrogen compounds
  contributes to respiratory disease'
