direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of pricing policies allows manufacturers to market ready-to-drink
  alcohol products at very low prices per standard drink'
- 'Step 2: Low prices reduce economic barriers to alcohol purchase, particularly for
  price-sensitive consumers including young people and low-income populations'
- 'Step 3: Increased affordability and accessibility of alcohol products leads to
  higher volume and frequency of alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 4: Greater alcohol availability and consumption at population level increases
  overall alcohol-related health risks'
