direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher real prices of alcohol reduce affordability and economic accessibility
  of alcoholic beverages across population'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol affordability leads to decreased alcohol consumption at
  population level'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption reduces intoxication rates and impaired judgment
  in social settings'
- 'Step 4: Decreased intoxication reduces interpersonal conflicts and aggressive behaviors
  that lead to violent injury'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in violent incidents translates to fewer emergency department
  attendances for violence-related injuries'
