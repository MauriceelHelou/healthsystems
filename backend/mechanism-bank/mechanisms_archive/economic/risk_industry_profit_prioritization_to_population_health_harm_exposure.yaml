direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neoliberal policy frameworks establish economic conditions where corporate
  profit maximization is prioritized over public health protection'
- 'Step 2: Risk industries (tobacco, alcohol, gambling, sugar) deploy SAPROs to maintain
  policy environments favorable to profit generation'
- 'Step 3: Profit-driven production and marketing of harmful products continues with
  minimal regulatory constraint'
- 'Step 4: Population-level exposure to health-damaging products remains high, resulting
  in sustained disease burden and health inequities'
