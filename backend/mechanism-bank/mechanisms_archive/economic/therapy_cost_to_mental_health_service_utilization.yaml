direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High therapy costs create direct financial barriers for nursing students
  who typically have limited income during training periods'
- 'Step 2: Financial inaccessibility prevents service utilization even among those
  with positive attitudes toward help-seeking'
- 'Step 3: Inability to afford services forces students to forgo needed mental health
  support despite recognizing its value'
- 'Step 4: Untreated mental health needs accumulate, potentially leading to worsening
  psychological distress and impaired academic/professional functioning'
