direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher retail density increases population-level access to cannabis products'
- 'Step 2: Increased access includes access to higher-potency products available in legal markets'
- 'Step 3: Higher consumption rates and exposure to high-potency products increase risk of psychotic episodes'
- 'Step 4: Cannabis-induced psychosis leads to psychiatric emergency presentations and hospital admissions'

description: The review found that increased legal cannabis availability is linked to increased psychosis
  presentations, representing a serious mental health outcome associated with the commercial cannabis
  environment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism links commercial regulation to mental health outcomes through structural
    pathways. The finding supports policy interventions targeting retail density rather than individual
    consumption choices. Equity implications exist if retail concentration varies by neighborhood socioeconomic
    characteristics.
