direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol advertisements in residential neighborhoods increases visual exposure
  to alcohol marketing cues'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure to advertising normalizes alcohol consumption and triggers consumption behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Increased consumption frequency and quantity leads to development of alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 4: Physiological dependence results in withdrawal syndrome requiring medical treatment when alcohol
  is unavailable'

description: Neighborhood alcohol advertising density is associated with increased risk of hospital admission
  for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, representing an environmental exposure that promotes alcohol consumption
  patterns leading to dependence.

  description: Advertising density within one-quarter and one-half mile of home both examined as potential
    risk factors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol advertising represents a commercial determinant of health that disproportionately
    targets certain communities. Marketing saturation in neighborhoods is a structural factor shaped by
    advertising regulations and zoning policies. This mechanism avoids individual blame by recognizing
    how environmental exposures shape consumption patterns. Policy interventions restricting alcohol advertising
    near homes represent equity-oriented structural solutions.
