category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bars and restaurants serve as venues where alcohol consumption occurs in close physical proximity
  to others'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption in these settings reduces inhibitions and compliance with distancing measures'
- 'Step 3: Indoor dining/drinking environments with poor ventilation facilitate aerosol transmission'
- 'Step 4: Social nature of on-premise consumption involves conversation (droplet production) and prolonged
  contact'
- 'Step 5: COVID-19 infections increase in the population 2 weeks following elevated on-premise consumption'

description: On-premise alcohol consumption at bars and restaurants showed dramatically larger effect
  sizes (+77.27% increase in COVID-19 infections at 2-week lag per standard drink/person/week) compared
  to retail alcohol sales, reflecting the high-risk transmission environment of indoor social drinking
  venues.

  variation_notes: Effect observed across three Canadian provinces with varying levels of COVID-19 restrictions
    on bars and restaurants
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how built environment features (hospitality venues)
    interact with alcohol policy to create differential health risks. The substantially higher transmission
    risk from on-premise versus off-premise consumption reflects structural factors - the physical design
    of bars/restaurants that cluster people together - rather than individual drinking choices. Policy
    decisions about when and how to restrict hospitality venues during pandemics have major public health
    implications.
