- 'Step 1: Spatial clustering of cannabis dispensaries creates concentrated retail environments in specific
  geographic areas'
- 'Step 2: Clustered outlets increase environmental salience and normalization of cannabis through multiple
  visible retail establishments'
- 'Step 3: Marketing and signage exposure is amplified in clustered areas, potentially triggering cue-induced
  craving and purchasing'
- 'Step 4: Concentrated retail environments facilitate daily/near-daily cannabis consumption patterns'

description: Spatial clustering of cannabis dispensaries was associated with daily/near-daily cannabis
  use in Washington State's early legal market. Clustering may operate through different mechanisms than
  simple count or proximity measures, potentially involving environmental normalization and increased
  cue exposure.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Clustering measures detected greater densities in urban areas. The association between
    clustering and daily/near-daily use suggests that concentrated retail environments may have distinct
    effects on high-frequency consumption.

  description: Urban areas showed greater clustering of dispensaries, potentially amplifying the clustering-consumption
    relationship
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The clustering mechanism demonstrates how commercial zoning and business licensing
    decisions create concentrated retail environments that shape population health behaviors. This is
    fundamentally a structural determinant created by policy decisions about where businesses can locate.
    Equity implications include the potential for clustering in lower-income or minority neighborhoods,
    though this study does not directly examine such disparities.
