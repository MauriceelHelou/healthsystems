direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher restaurant density creates commercial areas with increased foot traffic and economic
  activity'
- 'Step 2: Restaurant districts attract both legitimate patrons and potential offenders'
- 'Step 3: Cash transactions and valuable equipment in restaurants create targets for theft'
- 'Step 4: Mixed commercial-residential areas may have reduced informal social control'
- 'Step 5: Burglary rates are consistently higher in areas with greater restaurant densities'

description: Areas with greater densities of restaurants experience consistently higher burglary rates.
  Unlike the bar/pub associations with assault and DUI which showed weekend evening specificity, the restaurant-burglary
  relationship was consistent across all time periods examined.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study conducted in Oakland, California with 336 Census block groups; burglary-restaurant
    association was consistent across time periods unlike the temporal specificity seen with bar/pub effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding demonstrates how commercial land use patterns shape crime geography.
    The consistent temporal pattern (unlike assault/DUI) suggests different mechanisms may be operating
    - potentially related to commercial targets and routine activities rather than alcohol-related intoxication
    effects. Understanding these distinct pathways is important for targeted prevention strategies.
