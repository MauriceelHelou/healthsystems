direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: On-premise outlets (bars, restaurants) allow alcohol consumption on-site under supervision'
- 'Step 2: Staff oversight and responsible beverage service practices provide some regulation of consumption'
- 'Step 3: Despite supervision, outlets still serve as convergence points for potential offenders and
  victims'
- 'Step 4: Violent crime increases but at a lower rate compared to off-premise outlets due to partial
  regulatory effects'

description: A 10% increase in access to on-premise outlets was associated with a 3.0% increase in violent
  crime exposure. This effect was smaller than off-premise outlets, suggesting that on-site supervision
  may partially mitigate the crime-outlet relationship.

  description: On-premise outlets have inherent supervision mechanisms that partially attenuate the crime-outlet
    relationship compared to off-premise
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The differential effect between on- and off-premise outlets demonstrates that regulatory
    structures matter. On-premise establishments with required staffing and oversight show weaker crime
    associations, suggesting policy interventions requiring supervision and responsible service could
    reduce harm. This points to regulatory failure rather than individual behavior as the root cause.
