direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic aircraft noise exposure causes intermittent high-intensity noise events disrupting
  physiological homeostasis'
- 'Step 2: Repeated startle responses and sleep disturbance activate stress pathways'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress promotes metabolic dysfunction including insulin resistance'
- 'Step 4: Metabolic disturbances contribute to diabetes onset and progression'
- 'Step 5: Diabetes complications increase mortality risk'

description: Aircraft noise exposure shows a suggestive but not statistically significant association
  with diabetes mortality in the primary analysis (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.02). However, combined meta-analysis
  of incidence and mortality studies showed a significant positive association.

  variation_notes: A subset analysis around airports was conducted; combined incidence and mortality meta-analysis
    showed significant association (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.03)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Communities near airports are often socioeconomically disadvantaged and face cumulative
    environmental burdens. Airport siting decisions and flight path determinations are structural factors
    that create unequal noise exposure. This analysis provides evidence that should inform environmental
    justice considerations in aviation policy.
