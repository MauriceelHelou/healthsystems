direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban heat islands expose residents to elevated temperatures and thermal discomfort'
- 'Step 2: Heat stress activates physiological arousal and reduces frustration tolerance'
- 'Step 3: Lower thresholds for aggression increase verbal and physical threatening behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Poorly designed urban spaces lacking thermal refuge intensify exposure'
- 'Step 5: Threatening behavior increases as manifestation of heat-induced aggression'

description: The study specifically analyzed threatening behavior alongside homicide, assault, and robbery,
  finding correlations with temperature and urban heat island effects.

  description: Well-designed spaces that provide thermal comfort may reduce threatening behavior
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Threatening behavior as a crime category reflects how environmental stressors manifest
    in interpersonal interactions. Urban design that fails to provide thermal refuge creates conditions
    for aggression, placing responsibility on planning decisions rather than individual moral failings.
