direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant women in high tobacco retail density neighborhoods face constant environmental cues
  to smoke'
- 'Step 2: Easy accessibility undermines cessation attempts during pregnancy when cravings occur'
- 'Step 3: Stress and socioeconomic factors intersect with retail environment to maintain smoking'
- 'Step 4: Lack of tobacco-free zones in residential areas removes protective environmental support for
  quitting'

description: Positive associations were found between tobacco outlet density and cigarette smoking in
  pregnancy, though specific pooled effect estimates for this subgroup were not reported in the meta-analysis
  summary.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Tobacco retail density varies substantially by neighborhood socioeconomic status, disproportionately
    affecting lower-income pregnant women
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Maternal smoking during pregnancy reflects environmental constraints on cessation
    rather than maternal irresponsibility. Lower-income neighborhoods often have higher tobacco retail
    density, creating structural inequities in prenatal health. This mechanism supports neighborhood-level
    interventions to support maternal cessation.
