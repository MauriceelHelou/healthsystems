- 'Step 1: Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) with Housing First approach provides
  immediate, unconditional access to permanent housing without requiring ''housing
  readiness'' (sobriety or psychiatric treatment compliance)'
- 'Step 2: Housing stability is established as individuals gain secure, long-term
  residence with accompanying supportive services (health, mental health, and social
  services)'
- 'Step 3: Stable housing tenure is maintained through integrated support services
  that address underlying health and social needs without housing contingency'
- 'Step 4: Direct reduction in homelessness as individuals transition from unhoused
  status to permanent stable housing, with sustained housing retention over time'

description: A Community Guide systematic review of 26 studies demonstrates that Permanent
  Supportive Housing with Housing First approach substantially reduces homelessness
  among disabled populations. The intervention provides immediate permanent housing
  without requiring sobriety or treatment compliance ('housing readiness'), paired
  with voluntary supportive services. Compared to Treatment First approaches, Housing
  First decreased homelessness by 88% and improved housing stability by 41%. The mechanism
  operates through unconditional housing provision that removes barriers to housing
  access while integrating health and social services to maintain stability.
