direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of off-premises alcohol establishments (liquor stores, package stores) increases
  access to alcohol for off-site consumption'
- 'Step 2: Off-premises outlets often attract loitering and public drinking in surrounding areas'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol consumption in public spaces and homes leads to interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Neighborhood-level alcohol availability contributes to violence through both direct intoxication
  effects and social disorder'

description: License D alcohol outlets (off-premises establishments like liquor stores) are positively
  associated with aggravated assault rates, with each unit increase associated with a 13% increase in
  assault incidence. This is a smaller effect than License C outlets, suggesting on-premises drinking
  venues have stronger violence associations.

  description: Poor communities experience both higher outlet density and compounded effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The distinction between outlet types reflects how zoning and licensing policies
    differentially shape violence risk. Liquor stores concentrated in low-income neighborhoods represent
    structural disadvantage, not individual choice. Policy interventions targeting outlet density represent
    structural solutions to violence prevention.
