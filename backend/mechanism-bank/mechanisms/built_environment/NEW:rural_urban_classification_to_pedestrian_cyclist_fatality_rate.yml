mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural areas have reduced access to emergency medical services and longer response times'
- 'Step 2: Rural roads may have higher speed limits and less pedestrian infrastructure'
- 'Step 3: Distance to trauma centers is greater in rural areas, delaying critical care'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of on-scene death occur in rural areas among alcohol-involved pedestrian crashes'

description: The study found that pedestrian victims, especially those under the influence of alcohol,
  die more frequently on the scene in rural areas. This points to structural factors related to built
  environment, emergency response infrastructure, and trauma care access.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how geographic and infrastructural inequities contribute
    to disparate mortality outcomes. Rural communities face systematic disadvantages in pedestrian safety
    infrastructure, emergency response times, and trauma care access. These structural factors compound
    the risks associated with alcohol-impaired pedestrians. Policy interventions should address rural-urban
    disparities in transportation safety infrastructure and emergency medical services rather than focusing
    solely on individual behavior.
