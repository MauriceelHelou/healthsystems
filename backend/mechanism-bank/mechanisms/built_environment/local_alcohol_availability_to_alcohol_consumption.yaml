mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High density of alcohol outlets in local areas increases physical availability
  and accessibility of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Greater availability contributes to normalization of drinking behaviors
  in community settings'
- 'Step 3: Normalization creates permissive drinking environments that facilitate
  alcohol purchase and consumption'
- 'Step 4: Increased consumption leads to greater alcohol-related harms at population
  level'
