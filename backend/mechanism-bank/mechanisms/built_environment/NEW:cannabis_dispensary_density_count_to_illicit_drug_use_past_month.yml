mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher counts of cannabis dispensaries within geographic buffers (3-5 miles) increase physical
  availability of cannabis products'
- 'Step 2: Greater availability reduces search costs and time required to obtain cannabis'
- 'Step 3: Reduced barriers to access facilitate initiation and maintenance of monthly/bimonthly cannabis
  use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Increased monthly/bimonthly cannabis consumption at the population level'

description: Cannabis dispensary availability, measured by counts within 3-5 mile geographic buffers,
  was associated with monthly/bimonthly cannabis use in the full Washington State sample during early
  non-medical legalization. This suggests that product availability through retail density influences
  regular consumption patterns.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Associations varied by urbanicity - the effect of count-based density measures on monthly/bimonthly
    use was observed in the full sample but differential patterns emerged between urban and suburban/rural
    areas. Crude counts and counts per population were higher in suburban/rural areas while counts per
    land area, counts in buffers, proximity, and clustering detected greater densities in urban areas.
moderators:
- name: urbanicity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Urban areas showed higher density by area-based measures while suburban/rural areas showed
    higher crude counts and per-population measures, suggesting different mechanisms may operate across
    urban-rural contexts
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately focuses on structural-level retail environment factors
    rather than individual choice or moral failing. The policy implication - that dispensary density thresholds
    and minimum distances between dispensaries may reduce regular use - represents a structural intervention
    approach. However, the study does not examine differential impacts by race, income, or other equity
    dimensions which would strengthen structural competency analysis.
