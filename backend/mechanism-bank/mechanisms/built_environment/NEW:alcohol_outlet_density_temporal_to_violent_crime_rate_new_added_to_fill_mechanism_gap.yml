direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol outlet density varies spatially across neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol sales and consumption at outlets follow predictable temporal patterns (peak during
  weekend evenings)'
- 'Step 3: Periods of highest sales correspond to periods of greatest intoxication in the area'
- 'Step 4: Intoxication increases risk of violent behavior and victimization'
- 'Step 5: Crime incidents cluster spatially around outlets and temporally during peak consumption periods'

description: The study's innovative micro-temporal approach demonstrates that alcohol outlet-crime relationships
  are not constant but vary by time periods corresponding to peak alcohol sales. This spatiotemporal signature
  strengthens causal inference by showing that crime increases in outlet-dense areas specifically when
  alcohol sales are greatest.

  equity_implications: This methodological approach strengthens causal claims about alcohol outlets as
    structural determinants of crime by addressing confounding. By showing temporal specificity (effects
    strongest when alcohol sales peak), the study provides evidence that the relationship is not merely
    due to unobserved neighborhood characteristics that affect both outlet location and crime. This supports
    structural interventions targeting outlet licensing, hours of operation, and geographic density rather
    than individual-level approaches. The 15-year longitudinal design (2000-2015) across 336 Census block
    groups provides robust spatial-temporal evidence.
