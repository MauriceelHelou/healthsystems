direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of snack bars selling alcohol within 200 meters of adolescent residences increases
  physical accessibility to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Proximity reduces barriers to acquisition including travel time and effort needed to obtain
  alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Increased availability normalizes alcohol presence in the immediate neighborhood environment'
- 'Step 4: Adolescents have greater opportunity for direct purchase or indirect access through social
  networks frequenting these establishments'
- 'Step 5: Increased exposure and access leads to higher rates of current alcohol consumption'

description: Each additional snack bar within 200 meters of an adolescent's residence is associated with
  a 13% increase in the prevalence of current alcohol consumption. This reflects how the built environment's
  commercial alcohol landscape shapes adolescent drinking behaviors through increased accessibility.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how urban planning decisions regarding commercial zoning
    and alcohol licensing create differential exposure to alcohol retail environments. Lower-income neighborhoods
    may have higher concentrations of such outlets, creating structural inequities in adolescent alcohol
    exposure. The focus is appropriately on environmental determinants rather than individual adolescent
    choices.
