- 'Step 1: On-premise alcohol outlets (bars, restaurants) are locations for public alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumed at on-premise locations may contribute to intoxication'
- 'Step 3: However, domestic violence occurs primarily in private/home settings'
- 'Step 4: On-premise consumption may be less directly linked to household violence dynamics'
- 'Step 5: No significant relationship found between on-premise density and male-on-female domestic violence'

description: Unlike off-premise outlets, on-premise alcohol outlet density (bars, restaurants) did not
  demonstrate a significant relationship with male-on-female domestic violence. This null finding suggests
  that the location of alcohol consumption matters - alcohol purchased for home consumption (off-premise)
  may be more directly linked to domestic violence than alcohol consumed in public establishments.

  equity_implications: 'This null finding is structurally informative: it suggests that policies targeting
    bars and restaurants may be less effective for preventing domestic violence than policies targeting
    liquor stores and other off-premise outlets. The differential effect by outlet type points to the
    importance of understanding how environmental features shape the specific contexts in which violence
    occurs.'
