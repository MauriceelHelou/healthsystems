mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ridesharing services (e.g., Uber) are introduced in urban areas, providing an alternative transportation
  option'
- 'Step 2: Individuals who have consumed alcohol can access on-demand transportation via smartphone application'
- 'Step 3: Availability of alternative transportation reduces likelihood of impaired driving after alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in drunk driving incidents leads to decreased alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes'

description: The introduction of Uber ridesharing in Santiago, Chile was associated with a 29% reduction
  in alcohol-related crashes in high socioeconomic municipalities during the first 9 months of service.
  This protective effect was not observed in low socioeconomic municipalities, suggesting that structural
  barriers including credit card access and technology adoption mediate the relationship between ridesharing
  availability and crash reduction.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how technological interventions can exacerbate health
    inequities when access barriers are not addressed. The differential effect by socioeconomic status
    reflects structural inequities in financial services access (credit card ownership) and digital infrastructure.
    Rather than blaming individuals for drunk driving, this research identifies systemic barriers that
    prevent low-income populations from benefiting equally from harm reduction interventions. Policy implications
    include need for alternative payment methods for ridesharing or subsidized access in lower-income
    areas.
