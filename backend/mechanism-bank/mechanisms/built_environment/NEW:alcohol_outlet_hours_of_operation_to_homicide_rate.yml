  node_name: Homicide Rate
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended alcohol sales hours increase availability of alcohol during late-night periods when
  situational risk factors for lethal violence are elevated'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged drinking sessions enabled by late closing hours increase the likelihood of severe
  intoxication'
- 'Step 3: Severe intoxication impairs judgment, increases aggression, and reduces conflict de-escalation
  capacity'
- 'Step 4: Concentration of intoxicated individuals around bars/taverns creates conditions conducive to
  escalation of conflicts to lethal violence'
- 'Step 5: Restricting hours of sale reduces the temporal overlap between peak intoxication and environmental
  conditions favoring violent outcomes'

description: The study found similar reductions in homicides following the restriction of bar/tavern hours
  from 20 to 13 hours per day. While the abstract reports 'similar results' for homicides compared to
  all violent crime, specific effect sizes for homicides alone are not provided in the abstract. The mechanism
  operates through reducing late-night alcohol availability in geographic areas immediately surrounding
  bars and taverns.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effect localized to treatment neighborhood in Baltimore; results described as 'similar'
    to all violent crime for homicides specifically but exact effect size not provided in abstract

  description: Effects measured within 800-ft buffer of bars/taverns; mechanism is spatially concentrated
    around alcohol outlets
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Homicide is framed as a predictable outcome of structural conditions (alcohol availability,
    temporal patterns, spatial concentration) rather than solely individual criminality. Policy intervention
    at the structural level (hours regulation) addresses upstream determinants of lethal violence.
