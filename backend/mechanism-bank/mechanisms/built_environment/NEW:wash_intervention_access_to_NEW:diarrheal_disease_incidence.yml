- 'Step 1: Humanitarian crises disrupt water and sanitation infrastructure, creating unsafe water sources
  and inadequate sanitation facilities'
- 'Step 2: WaSH interventions provide access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation facilities, and
  hygiene education/supplies'
- 'Step 3: Safe water access reduces exposure to waterborne pathogens including Vibrio cholerae and other
  enteric bacteria'
- 'Step 4: Improved sanitation prevents fecal contamination of water sources and living environments'
- 'Step 5: Reduced pathogen exposure decreases diarrheal disease incidence and related morbidity'

description: WaSH interventions during humanitarian crises reduce diarrheal disease incidence by improving
  access to safe water, adequate sanitation, and hygiene practices. Diarrheal diseases were the most commonly
  reported outcome (46% of impact evaluations), and cholera outbreaks represented 43% of crisis contexts,
  highlighting the critical role of water and sanitation infrastructure in preventing waterborne disease
  transmission during emergencies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural determinants of health by focusing on infrastructure
    and environmental conditions rather than individual behaviors. Humanitarian crises disproportionately
    affect marginalized populations who lack resources for private water/sanitation solutions. The mechanism
    recognizes that health outcomes are shaped by access to basic services during emergencies, which is
    determined by policy decisions, resource allocation, and humanitarian response capacity rather than
    individual choices.
