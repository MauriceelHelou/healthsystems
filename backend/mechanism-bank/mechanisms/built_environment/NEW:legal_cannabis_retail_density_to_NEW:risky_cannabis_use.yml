description: The association between legal cannabis availability and risky use indicators was less consistent
  than the association with general cannabis use, suggesting the pathway from availability to problematic
  use may involve additional factors.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 333550
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies from North America showed less consistent associations for risky use compared
    to general use.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The weaker and less consistent evidence for risky use suggests that while availability
    influences initiation and general use, the development of problematic patterns may require additional
    structural or individual vulnerability factors. This nuance is important for targeted policy interventions.
