direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of restaurants serving alcohol within 200 meters increases environmental exposure
  to alcohol availability'
- 'Step 2: Restaurants provide settings where alcohol consumption is normalized as part of social dining'
- 'Step 3: Adolescents may accompany family members to restaurants where alcohol is served, increasing
  exposure'
- 'Step 4: Higher restaurant density increases opportunities for adolescent alcohol acquisition through
  various channels'
- 'Step 5: Environmental availability translates to increased likelihood of current alcohol consumption'

description: Each additional restaurant serving alcohol within 200 meters of an adolescent's residence
  is associated with an 11% increase in the prevalence of current alcohol consumption. While showing the
  smallest effect among significant outlet types, restaurants still contribute to the cumulative alcohol
  environment affecting youth.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that alcohol availability extends beyond dedicated
    drinking establishments. Restaurant licensing policies that permit alcohol service contribute to the
    overall alcohol landscape surrounding adolescents. This supports comprehensive approaches to alcohol
    control that consider all commercial alcohol sources rather than targeting specific outlet types.
