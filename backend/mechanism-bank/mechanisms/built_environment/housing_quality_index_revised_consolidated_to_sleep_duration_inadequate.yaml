mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing conditions create physical environmental stressors including
  noise, inadequate temperature control, overcrowding, and uncomfortable sleeping
  arrangements'
- 'Step 2: These environmental stressors directly interfere with sleep onset, sleep
  maintenance, and sleep quality through disruption of circadian rhythms and frequent
  awakenings'
- 'Step 3: Additionally, poor housing conditions contribute to psychological distress
  and anxiety which further impair sleep through rumination, hyperarousal, and difficulty
  relaxing'
- 'Step 4: The combination of physical and psychological disruptions leads to inadequate
  sleep duration and poor sleep quality among residents of substandard housing'

description: This systematic review identified sleep as one of ten key health outcome
  categories affected by student housing conditions. Poor housing conditions were
  associated with sleep problems through both direct environmental pathways (noise,
  comfort, overcrowding) and indirect psychological pathways (stress, anxiety, distress).
  The review emphasized housing as one of the most important areas related to individual
  well-being, with sleep being a critical intermediary between housing quality and
  broader health outcomes.
