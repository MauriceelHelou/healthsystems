mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High concentration of alcohol outlets in residential neighborhoods increases alcohol accessibility'
- 'Step 2: Increased physical availability normalizes alcohol consumption in community'
- 'Step 3: Greater accessibility facilitates problematic alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Community members identified need for substance use supports indicating recognition of this
  pathway'

description: The causal loop diagrams developed by stakeholders implicitly recognize the relationship
  between alcohol outlet presence and substance use challenges, as community members emphasized the need
  for additional substance use supports when discussing policy outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces substance use challenges to environmental availability rather
    than individual moral failing. The stakeholder-identified need for substance use supports reflects
    understanding that removing outlets alone does not address underlying treatment needs in structurally
    disadvantaged communities. Equity implications include recognition that alcohol outlets are disproportionately
    concentrated in low-income communities and communities of color.
