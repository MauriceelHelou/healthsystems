  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High density of alcohol outlets (18.30-80.95 per km²) increases physical availability of alcohol
  in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Proximity to educational institutions (12% of outlets within 100m) creates alcogenic environments
  targeting youth'
- 'Step 3: Weak policy enforcement (94% of on-premise outlets lack age restriction signage) reduces barriers
  to underage purchase'
- 'Step 4: Increased availability and accessibility normalizes alcohol consumption among youth populations'
- 'Step 5: Environmental exposure leads to increased alcohol consumption and binge drinking behaviors'

description: High alcohol outlet density in urban neighborhoods, particularly near educational institutions,
  creates an alcogenic environment that increases alcohol availability and accessibility to youth, contributing
  to underage drinking patterns

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately traces youth drinking to structural factors (urban
    planning, licensing policy, enforcement capacity) rather than individual choice. The study reveals
    how weak regulatory environments and commercial interests create differential exposure in areas with
    high youth populations. Policy solutions include enforcing existing licensing laws (100m distance
    requirement from schools), requiring age restriction signage, and limiting outlet density through
    zoning regulations.
