direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High tobacco retail density creates persistent environmental cues that trigger cravings during
  quit attempts'
- 'Step 2: Easy accessibility makes relapse more likely when experiencing withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Point-of-sale marketing undermines motivation to quit by promoting tobacco products'
- 'Step 4: Lack of tobacco-free environments reduces social support for cessation'

description: Tobacco retail density is positively associated with smoking and negatively associated with
  cessation success. The review found positive associations between outlet density and cessation failure,
  though specific pooled estimates were not reported.

  variation_notes: Restrictive retail laws based on proximity may not reduce smoking except in specific
    subgroups like men who smoke heavily

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cessation success is not merely a matter of individual willpower but is shaped
    by the retail environment. Reducing retailer density removes structural barriers to quitting and represents
    a population-level intervention that can reduce health inequities in smoking-related disease.
