direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry invests heavily (€30 million) in NoLo production capacity and marketing'
- 'Step 2: NoLo products use similar iconography and brand identifiers as full-strength parent brands'
- 'Step 3: Advertising appears in protected spaces (near buses, trains, schools, playgrounds) where full-strength
  alcohol ads are prohibited'
- 'Step 4: Increased ubiquity of alcohol brand imagery creates more alcogenic environments'
- 'Step 5: Greater ambient alcohol marketing exposure normalizes alcohol consumption across populations'

description: NoLo alcohol advertising exploits regulatory loopholes to place alcohol brand imagery in
  spaces where full-strength alcohol advertising is prohibited, effectively increasing alcogenic environments
  and normalizing alcohol consumption through ubiquitous brand exposure.

  variation_notes: Paper focuses specifically on Ireland; regulatory loopholes may differ by jurisdiction
    based on how alcohol advertising laws define 'alcohol products'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how alcohol industry corporate strategies exploit regulatory
    gaps to increase alcohol marketing exposure. The structural root cause is inadequate policy implementation
    rather than individual choice. Affects all populations exposed to these environments, with particular
    concern for children and young people near schools/playgrounds, and vulnerable groups including those
    in recovery.
