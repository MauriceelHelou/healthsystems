description: Rural vendors were 2.27 times more likely to violate the ban on sales to/by minors compared
  to urban vendors (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.96). This geographic disparity reflects structural differences
  in policy implementation and enforcement capacity between urban and rural areas.

  variation_notes: The study explicitly compared urban and rural vendors across three districts of Khyber
    Pakhtunkhwa province, finding significant urban/rural disparities in compliance
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how geographic inequities in regulatory infrastructure
    create differential tobacco access. Rural communities face structural disadvantages in tobacco control
    implementation, not due to individual vendor decisions but due to systemic under-resourcing of rural
    enforcement systems. This creates health equity implications as rural youth face greater tobacco exposure.
