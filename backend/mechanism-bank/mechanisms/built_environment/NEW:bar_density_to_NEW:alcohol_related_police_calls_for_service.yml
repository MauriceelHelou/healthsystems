category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher bar density increases physical availability and accessibility of alcohol in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Bars serve as venues where heavy drinking occurs on-premise with immediate consumption'
- 'Step 3: Patrons leaving bars may engage in public intoxication, disorderly conduct, or violence'
- 'Step 4: These alcohol-related incidents generate increased police calls-for-service in the area'

description: Higher bar density in neighborhoods is positively associated with alcohol-related police
  calls-for-service. Bars create environments for heavy drinking and public intoxication that generate
  neighborhood disorder requiring police intervention.

    social acceptance of drinking compared to the U.S. Results may differ in other cultural contexts.

    economic status
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural factors including zoning policies and alcohol
    licensing that determine where bars can operate. The concentration of bars in certain neighborhoods
    creates differential exposure to alcohol-related harms. Economic status influences bar location, potentially
    creating different risk profiles across neighborhoods.
