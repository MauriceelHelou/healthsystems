to_node:
  node_id: homicide_rate
  node_name: Homicide Rate
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of bars and taverns increases locations where alcohol is consumed in social
  settings'
- 'Step 2: On-premise consumption environments can facilitate intoxication and reduce inhibitions'
- 'Step 3: Social dynamics in drinking establishments may lead to interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Concentration of intoxicated patrons in geographic areas creates conditions for violence'
- 'Step 5: Altercations escalate to lethal violence, increasing homicide rates'

description: On-premise alcohol outlets (bars/taverns) are associated with increased homicide rates (IRR=1.41),
  though the effect is weaker than off-premise outlets. Removing bars/taverns operating as liquor stores
  would prevent only 1 homicide annually.

  description: Bars/taverns operating as liquor stores showed minimal independent effect on homicides
    (only 1 homicide reduction projected if removed)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how different types of alcohol retail environments
    have differential impacts on violence. The finding that hybrid establishments (bars operating as liquor
    stores) have minimal impact suggests the primary driver is off-premise availability rather than on-premise
    consumption settings. This informs targeted policy approaches.
