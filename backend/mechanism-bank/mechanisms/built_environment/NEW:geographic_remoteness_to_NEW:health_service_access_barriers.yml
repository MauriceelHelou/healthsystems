mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographically remote areas have fewer health service providers and facilities'
- 'Step 2: Distance creates transportation barriers to accessing prevention services'
- 'Step 3: Remote adolescents have limited exposure to health promotion programs'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access contributes to greater engagement in risk behaviors including poor diet and
  alcohol use'

description: Geographic remoteness creates structural barriers to health services that contribute to disproportionate
  chronic disease burden among rural adolescents. eHealth interventions can help overcome these geographic
  barriers.

  variation_notes: This mechanism is fundamentally about geographic variation - remote populations face
    distinct barriers compared to urban populations

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that geographic location - a structural factor - determines
    access to prevention services. Health disparities among remote populations are not due to individual
    choices but to spatial inequities in service distribution. Policy implications include investment
    in digital health infrastructure for remote areas.
