mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing conditions (inadequate space, noise, poor maintenance, safety
  concerns) create chronic environmental stressors for residents'
- 'Step 2: These stressors disrupt sleep quality, increase feelings of insecurity,
  and reduce sense of control over one''s living environment'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to substandard housing conditions activates prolonged
  stress responses and reduces adaptive coping capacity'
- 'Step 4: Sustained stress and reduced wellbeing manifest as increased symptoms of
  depression, anxiety, and psychological distress'

description: This systematic review demonstrates that housing conditions play an important
  role in psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and other mental
  health conditions among higher education students. Better housing quality is associated
  with reduced risk of depression and anxiety through multiple pathways including
  improved sleep, reduced environmental stressors, and enhanced overall wellbeing.
  The relationship is bidirectional in some cases but the primary direction shows
  poor housing conditions contributing to mental health problems.
