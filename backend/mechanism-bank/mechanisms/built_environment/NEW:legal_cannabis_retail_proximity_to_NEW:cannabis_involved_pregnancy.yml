mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Closer proximity to cannabis retailers reduces physical barriers to purchase'
- 'Step 2: Reduced barriers increase likelihood of cannabis use among reproductive-age women'
- 'Step 3: Increased use leads to higher rates of cannabis exposure during pregnancy'
- 'Step 4: Cannabis-involved pregnancies present with specific health monitoring and intervention needs'

description: The systematic review found that increased availability of legal cannabis, measured by proximity
  to retailers, is associated with increased cannabis-involved pregnancies, representing a specific maternal
  health outcome.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies conducted in North American jurisdictions with varying regulatory frameworks
    for cannabis.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how commercial environment affects maternal health outcomes
    through structural pathways. Geographic placement of cannabis retail creates differential exposure
    by neighborhood, potentially exacerbating health inequities if retailers concentrate in certain areas.
    Policy focus on zoning and density restrictions represents structural intervention.
