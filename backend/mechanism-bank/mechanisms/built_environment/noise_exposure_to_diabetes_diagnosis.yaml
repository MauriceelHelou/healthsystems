mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic environmental noise exposure (from traffic, occupational, or neighborhood
  sources) activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress response'
- 'Step 2: Sustained stress activation leads to elevated cortisol levels and chronic
  sympathetic nervous system arousal'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress hormones impair glucose metabolism, promote insulin resistance,
  and contribute to metabolic dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Sleep disruption from noise exposure further exacerbates metabolic dysregulation
  through altered circadian rhythms and reduced sleep quality'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative metabolic dysfunction increases risk of developing type 2 diabetes'

description: Environmental noise exposure is associated with a 23% increased risk
  of diabetes. This umbrella review of 23 systematic reviews and meta-analyses found
  consistent evidence linking noise to metabolic outcomes, with a clear dose-response
  relationship where diabetes risk increases with higher noise exposure levels. The
  mechanism operates through chronic stress activation, metabolic disruption, and
  sleep disturbance pathways.
