direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower economic status neighborhoods have fewer resources to resist alcohol outlet proliferation'
- 'Step 2: Weaker political representation and zoning enforcement in disadvantaged areas permits more
  outlets'
- 'Step 3: Off-premise outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores) cluster in areas with lower economic
  status'
- 'Step 4: This creates disproportionate alcohol availability in already vulnerable communities'

description: Off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores selling alcohol) are disproportionately
  concentrated in neighborhoods with lower economic status, creating inequitable exposure to alcohol availability.

  variation_notes: This pattern of off-premise outlet concentration in lower economic status areas was
    observed in Valencia, Spain, consistent with findings from U.S. studies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects environmental injustice in alcohol outlet distribution.
    Disadvantaged neighborhoods bear disproportionate burden of off-premise alcohol availability due to
    weaker political power, less restrictive zoning, and economic incentives for outlet operators. This
    structural pattern perpetuates health inequities as low-income communities face greater alcohol exposure.
