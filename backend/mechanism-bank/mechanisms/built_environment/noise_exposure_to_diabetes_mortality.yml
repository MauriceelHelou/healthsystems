mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term residential exposure to road traffic noise (≥46 dB Lden) triggers chronic physiological
  stress responses'
- 'Step 2: Chronic noise-induced stress activates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic
  nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Sustained stress hormone elevation promotes insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction, and
  systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 4: These metabolic disturbances contribute to diabetes development and progression'
- 'Step 5: Diabetes complications lead to increased mortality risk'

description: Long-term residential exposure to road traffic noise is independently associated with increased
  diabetes mellitus mortality, with a 6% increase in hazard per 10 dB increase in day-evening-night noise
  level (Lden). The threshold effect appears around 46 dB, which is well below the WHO guideline level
  of 53 dB.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how transportation infrastructure decisions and urban
    planning create unequal noise exposure burdens. Lower-income and minority communities are often disproportionately
    located near highways and major roads, creating environmental injustice in noise exposure. The finding
    that effects occur below WHO guideline levels suggests current standards may inadequately protect
    health. Policy interventions should address noise mitigation in residential areas and consider health
    equity in transportation planning.
