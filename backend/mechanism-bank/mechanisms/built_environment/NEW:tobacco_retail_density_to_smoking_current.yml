direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of tobacco retailers increases physical accessibility and convenience of purchasing
  cigarettes'
- 'Step 2: Increased visibility of tobacco products through storefront advertising and point-of-sale displays
  normalizes smoking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Proximity reduces barriers to impulsive purchasing and undermines quit attempts by providing
  easy access during cravings'
- 'Step 4: Concentration of retailers in communities creates an obesogenic-like environment for tobacco
  that promotes initiation and sustained use'

description: Higher tobacco retail density is consistently associated with increased cigarette smoking
  among adults. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 62 studies found positive associations between
  outlet density and smoking behaviors across multiple populations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies retail environment as a structural determinant of smoking
    rather than framing tobacco use as purely individual choice. The built environment shapes accessibility
    and normalizes consumption. Tobacco retailers are often concentrated in lower-income and minority
    neighborhoods, creating structural health inequities. Policy interventions limiting retail density
    address root causes rather than targeting individual behavior.
