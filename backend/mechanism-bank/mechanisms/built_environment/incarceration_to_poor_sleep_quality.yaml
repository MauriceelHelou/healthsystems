direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carceral environments impose structural barriers to quality sleep through
  institutional control over sleep-wake schedules, lighting, and environmental noise'
- 'Step 2: Built environment factors (cell design, ventilation, mattress quality)
  directly impair sleep quality through physical discomfort and sensory disruption'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from confinement, lack of safety, and social isolation activates
  physiological stress responses that fragment sleep'
- 'Step 4: Poor sleep quality prevalence rates (42.8%-88.2%) emerge substantially
  higher than general population norms'
