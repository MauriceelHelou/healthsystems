direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores) increases
  physical availability of alcohol in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol availability facilitates greater alcohol purchasing and consumption within
  households'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol intoxication impairs judgment, reduces inhibition, and increases aggression in potential
  perpetrators'
- 'Step 4: Neighborhood-level alcohol availability creates environmental conditions conducive to domestic
  violence incidents'
- 'Step 5: Male-on-female domestic violence rates increase in areas with higher off-premise outlet density'

description: Off-premise alcohol outlet density (liquor stores, convenience stores selling alcohol for
  consumption elsewhere) is significantly associated with male-on-female domestic violence at the neighborhood
  level, even after controlling for concentrated disadvantage and other neighborhood characteristics.
  This relationship operates through increased alcohol availability and consumption in home settings.

spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: Study specifically examined spatial spillover effects, finding that off-premise alcohol
    outlet density in surrounding block groups also predicts MFDV in focal block groups. Milwaukee, Wisconsin

moderators:
- name: concentrated_disadvantage
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Concentrated disadvantage was controlled for in models, suggesting it may interact with
    or confound the alcohol-violence relationship
- name: lack_of_health_insurance
  direction: strengthens
  strength: weak
  description: Lack of health insurance was included as a control variable, indicating potential interaction
    with neighborhood vulnerability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism identifies a structural/environmental determinant (alcohol outlet
    zoning and licensing policies) rather than blaming individual alcohol users. The finding that off-premise
    (not on-premise) outlets drive MFDV suggests that alcohol consumption in private/domestic settings
    is the key pathway. Equity implications: disadvantaged neighborhoods often have higher alcohol outlet
    density, creating environmental risk for intimate partner violence. Policy interventions could target
    alcohol licensing and zoning rather than individual behavior.'
