mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Disadvantaged neighborhoods have reduced access to healthy food, safe spaces for physical activity,
  and healthcare facilities'
- 'Step 2: Environmental exposures in disadvantaged neighborhoods may trigger or exacerbate autoimmune
  inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Transportation barriers limit ability to attend regular medical appointments'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative environmental and access disadvantages worsen disease trajectory'

description: Neighborhood and built environment factors contribute to lupus nephritis disparities through
  environmental exposures, resource availability, and access barriers
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Neighborhood effects inherently vary by geography and reflect historical patterns of
    residential segregation and disinvestment
moderators:
- name: Area deprivation index
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher area deprivation amplifies negative effects on outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Neighborhood disadvantage reflects historical and ongoing structural racism, redlining,
    and disinvestment rather than individual residential choices. Health equity interventions must address
    place-based inequities through community development, transportation infrastructure, and environmental
    justice.
