  node_id: assault_injury_rate
  node_name: Assault Injury Rate
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher population density increases frequency of interpersonal contact and potential conflict
  situations'
- 'Step 2: Dense urban environments may amplify heat island effects, compounding thermal stress'
- 'Step 3: Competition for limited resources and space increases tension'
- 'Step 4: Crowded conditions reduce privacy and increase friction between residents'
- 'Step 5: Elevated stress and conflict opportunity manifest as increased assault rates'

description: Population density shows positive correlation with crime in the analysis. The study examined
  assault as part of Offences against the Person, with density interacting with temperature and canopy
  cover.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Urban densification policies must be accompanied by adequate green infrastructure
    to avoid exacerbating crime. Low-income communities often face densification without corresponding
    investment in heat mitigation and green space, creating structural vulnerability to violence.
