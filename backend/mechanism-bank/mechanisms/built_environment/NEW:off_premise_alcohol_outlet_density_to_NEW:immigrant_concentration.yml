mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Immigrant communities often settle in affordable neighborhoods with weaker land use protections'
- 'Step 2: These areas may have less political voice to resist undesirable commercial development'
- 'Step 3: Off-premise alcohol retailers may target these areas due to lower operating costs'
- 'Step 4: Result is higher concentration of off-premise outlets in immigrant neighborhoods'

description: Off-premise alcohol outlet density is higher in neighborhoods with greater immigrant concentration,
  indicating potential environmental injustice in alcohol availability affecting immigrant communities.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 552
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Pattern observed in Valencia, Spain. Immigration patterns and their relationship to
    alcohol outlet density may vary across different national and local contexts.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights how structural factors including housing segregation, economic
    marginalization, and political disenfranchisement of immigrant communities combine to create disproportionate
    environmental exposures. The concentration of off-premise outlets in immigrant neighborhoods reflects
    broader patterns of environmental injustice.
