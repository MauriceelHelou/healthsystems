- 'Step 1: Zoning policy eliminates alcohol outlets (liquor stores) from residential districts'
- 'Step 2: Reduced physical availability of alcohol decreases alcohol accessibility in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol availability may reduce public intoxication and alcohol-fueled conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in gathering spots associated with crime decreases violent crime incidents'

description: A systems framework analysis using group model building with diverse stakeholders (community
  advocates, city officials/academics, community residents) to understand how alcohol outlet zoning policy
  eliminating liquor stores from residential areas could impact violent crime in Baltimore City. The study
  reveals complex neighborhood dynamics and potential unintended consequences that could undermine policy
  effectiveness.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This study exemplifies structural competency by examining how built environment
    policy (zoning) interacts with multiple structural factors including economic disinvestment, service
    access, and institutional trust. The participatory approach with diverse stakeholders reveals that
    alcohol outlet removal alone is insufficient without addressing underlying structural conditions (mental
    health services, economic investment, community-police relations). The framework avoids blaming individuals
    for alcohol-related harm and instead traces outcomes to spatial arrangements and policy decisions.
