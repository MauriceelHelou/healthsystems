direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic environmental noise exposure (traffic, occupational, aircraft)
  triggers repeated physiological stress responses including activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  axis and sympathetic nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Sustained stress activation leads to elevated blood pressure, increased
  cortisol and catecholamine release, and systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic hypertension and inflammatory processes accelerate atherosclerosis,
  endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness'
- 'Step 4: Progressive cardiovascular damage increases risk of fatal cardiovascular
  events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure'

description: This umbrella review of 23 systematic reviews and meta-analyses found
  that environmental noise exposure is associated with a 12% increased risk of cardiovascular
  disease mortality. The association demonstrates a dose-response relationship, with
  risk increasing as noise exposure levels rise. Multiple noise sources contribute
  including traffic, aircraft, and occupational noise. The evidence supports a pathway
  through chronic stress activation leading to hypertension and cardiovascular damage.
