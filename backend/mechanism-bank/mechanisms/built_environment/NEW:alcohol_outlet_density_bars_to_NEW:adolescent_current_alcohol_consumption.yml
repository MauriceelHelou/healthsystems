direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of bars within 200 meters of adolescent residences increases visibility and
  normalization of alcohol consumption in the community'
- 'Step 2: Bars serve as social venues where adult drinking is modeled and potentially accessible to adolescents'
- 'Step 3: Proximity to bars may facilitate social networks and peer influences that promote alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Higher bar density may correlate with weaker enforcement of age restrictions in the immediate
  area'
- 'Step 5: Combined environmental and social factors lead to increased current alcohol consumption among
  adolescents'

description: Each additional bar within 200 meters of an adolescent's residence is associated with a 21%
  increase in the prevalence of current alcohol consumption. Bars showed the strongest association among
  outlet types, reflecting their role as dedicated alcohol venues in shaping neighborhood alcohol environments.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding demonstrates how municipal licensing decisions and zoning policies
    create obesogenic and 'alcohogenic' environments that differentially affect youth based on where they
    live. The structural distribution of bars across neighborhoods reflects broader patterns of urban
    development and socioeconomic segregation. Interventions should focus on licensing regulations and
    zoning rather than adolescent behavior modification.
