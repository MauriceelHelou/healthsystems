mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-premise outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores) allow purchase of alcohol for consumption
  elsewhere'
- 'Step 2: Lack of effective measures to keep order in and around off-premise outlets creates opportunity
  for criminal activity'
- 'Step 3: Off-premise consumption occurs in unregulated public spaces without oversight or security measures'
- 'Step 4: This unmonitored alcohol consumption attracts or multiplies violent crime in surrounding areas'

description: A 10% increase in access to off-premise outlets was associated with a 4.4% increase in violent
  crime exposure. Off-premise outlets showed a greater association with violent crime than on-premise
  outlets, attributed to the lack of supervision and order maintenance around these establishments.

  description: The mechanism specifically notes that lack of effective measures to keep order around off-premise
    outlets contributes to the crime association
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights how commercial licensing policies that permit high concentrations
    of off-premise alcohol outlets create criminogenic environments. The structural factor is not individual
    alcohol consumption but rather the lack of regulatory requirements for security and order maintenance
    at off-premise locations. Policy solutions include licensing restrictions, security requirements,
    and zoning changes.
