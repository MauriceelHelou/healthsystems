description: Analysis focusing specifically on Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed an independent association
  with road traffic noise, suggesting noise-related mechanisms may affect diabetes outcomes regardless
  of diabetes etiology. Including deaths with Type 1 DM hardly changed the overall associations.

  equity_implications: This finding extends the potential impact of transportation noise beyond Type 2
    diabetes, which is more commonly linked to metabolic and lifestyle factors. It suggests that environmental
    exposures affect health outcomes across diabetes subtypes, reinforcing the importance of addressing
    structural environmental determinants.
