mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher per-outlet sales volume may indicate more organized retail environments with larger,
  established outlets'
- 'Step 2: Areas with higher per-outlet volume may have lower outlet proliferation and less neighborhood
  disorganization'
- 'Step 3: Lower neighborhood disorganization associated with better social cohesion and informal social
  control'
- 'Step 4: Improved community conditions may buffer against family stressors that contribute to maltreatment'
- 'Step 5: Reduced child maltreatment rates in areas with more organized alcohol retail environments'

description: For each additional 1,000 liters of ethanol sold per off-premise outlet, child maltreatment
  decreased by 3.7%. This counterintuitive finding suggests per-outlet sales volume may proxy for neighborhood
  organization rather than pure alcohol exposure, with areas having fewer but larger outlets showing lower
  maltreatment.

  description: Authors note outlet density may act as measure of less disorganization - the counterintuitive
    finding suggests high-volume established outlets differ from proliferated small outlets
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This complex finding highlights how simple measures of alcohol availability may
    conflate multiple structural factors. The authors suggest outlet density may indicate neighborhood
    disorganization - areas with many small outlets may reflect disinvestment and concentrated disadvantage
    that independently increases maltreatment risk. This underscores the importance of addressing root
    causes of community disorganization rather than only targeting alcohol access. Equity implications:
    Low-income and minority communities often experience both high outlet density AND concentrated disadvantage,
    requiring comprehensive approaches.'
