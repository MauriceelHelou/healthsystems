direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density increases neighborhood-level alcohol availability'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability leads to higher consumption and intoxication rates'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related violence increases, causing premature deaths and injuries'
- 'Step 4: Homicides and non-fatal violence result in years of life lost and years lived with disability'
- 'Step 5: Population-level burden measured in DALYs reflects cumulative health impact'

description: Reducing alcohol outlet density by one quintile in Baltimore was associated with prevention
  of 764 DALYs annually. Removing liquor stores from residential zones specifically would prevent 391
  DALYs.

  description: Full quintile reduction yields 764 DALYs prevented; residential zone liquor store removal
    yields 391 DALYs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism quantifies the population health burden attributable to structural
    alcohol availability decisions. DALYs capture both mortality and morbidity, providing a comprehensive
    measure of how zoning and licensing policies translate into community health outcomes. The analysis
    supports evidence-based policy change rather than individual-level interventions.
