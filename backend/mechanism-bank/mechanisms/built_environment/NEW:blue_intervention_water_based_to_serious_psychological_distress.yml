description: Blue interventions (water-based nature interventions) were identified as having significant
  effects on mental health outcomes when prescribed as part of social prescription programs.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to blue spaces (coastal areas, lakes, rivers) is often determined by housing
    location and socioeconomic status. Formalizing blue interventions through social prescription can
    address inequitable access to these therapeutic environments for marginalized communities.
