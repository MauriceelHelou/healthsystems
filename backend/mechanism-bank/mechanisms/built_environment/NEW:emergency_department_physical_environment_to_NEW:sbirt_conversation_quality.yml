description: The physical environment of emergency departments affects the quality of SBIRT conversations,
  with appropriate private spaces enabling more effective alcohol screening and intervention discussions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare facility design as a structural determinant
    of care quality. The physical infrastructure of emergency departments was built primarily for acute
    care, not preventive conversations. Retrofitting or redesigning spaces for SBIRT delivery requires
    institutional investment decisions that shape what care is possible.
