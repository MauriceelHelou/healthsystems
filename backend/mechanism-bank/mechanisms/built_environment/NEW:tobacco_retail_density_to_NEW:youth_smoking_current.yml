direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher tobacco retail density increases youth exposure to tobacco marketing and product availability
  in their daily environments'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents walking to school or recreation pass multiple tobacco outlets, normalizing smoking
  as a common adult behavior'
- 'Step 3: Peer influence is amplified when tobacco is easily accessible for social experimentation'
- 'Step 4: Reduced barriers to purchase (despite age restrictions) facilitate youth initiation and progression
  to regular use'

description: Higher tobacco retail density shows a significant positive association with current smoking
  among youth. The meta-analysis found an OR of 1.23 with notably low heterogeneity (I²=0%), suggesting
  a consistent effect across studies.

  variation_notes: School neighborhood environments vary in retail tobacco density, creating differential
    exposure for youth based on school location
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Youth are particularly vulnerable to environmental influences on health behaviors.
    The concentration of tobacco retailers near schools represents a structural failure to protect children.
    This mechanism avoids blaming youth for poor choices and instead identifies the commercial environment
    as the upstream cause requiring policy intervention.
