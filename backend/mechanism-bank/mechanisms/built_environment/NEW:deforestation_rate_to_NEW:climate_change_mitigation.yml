description: REDD+ programs aim to achieve climate change mitigation through reduced deforestation. The
  meta-analysis found moderate environmental impacts suggesting some climate benefit, though these were
  comparable to other conservation approaches and mostly impermanent. The connection between forest conservation
  and climate health outcomes operates through reduced greenhouse gas emissions and maintained ecosystem
  services.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This pathway connects environmental conservation policy to downstream health outcomes
    through climate change mitigation. Climate change disproportionately affects marginalized populations
    globally - those in low-income countries, coastal communities, and climate-vulnerable regions face
    greater exposure to heat, extreme weather, and climate-sensitive diseases. The modest and impermanent
    effects found suggest that current REDD+ implementation may not adequately address the structural
    drivers of deforestation, limiting health-protective climate benefits. The transition to larger-scale
    jurisdictional approaches mentioned may offer more equitable and effective structural interventions.
