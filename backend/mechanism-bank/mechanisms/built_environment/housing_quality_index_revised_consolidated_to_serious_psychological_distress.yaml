mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing quality exposes individuals to physical stressors including
  inadequate ventilation, temperature extremes, dampness, noise, overcrowding, and
  structural deficiencies'
- 'Step 2: These environmental stressors disrupt sleep quality, create chronic physiological
  stress responses, and reduce sense of safety and control over one''s environment'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to substandard housing conditions leads to increased symptoms
  of depression, anxiety, and overall psychological distress, while quality housing
  provides restorative environments that support mental wellbeing'

description: This systematic review synthesized evidence from 47 studies examining
  the relationship between housing conditions and psychological wellbeing among higher
  education students. Housing quality factors including physical conditions, crowding,
  noise levels, and safety were associated with multiple mental health outcomes including
  overall psychological distress, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and other
  health-related behaviors. Better housing quality was consistently associated with
  lower psychological distress across multiple outcome categories.
