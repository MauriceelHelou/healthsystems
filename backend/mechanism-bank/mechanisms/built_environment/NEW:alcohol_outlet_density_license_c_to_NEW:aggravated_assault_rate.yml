direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of combined on/off premises alcohol establishments (bars, restaurants with liquor
  sales) increases alcohol availability and consumption in the neighborhood'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol consumption leads to disinhibition and impaired judgment among patrons'
- 'Step 3: Concentration of intoxicated individuals in geographically dense areas increases interpersonal
  conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Physical altercations escalate to aggravated assaults in the immediate vicinity of alcohol
  outlets'

description: License C alcohol outlets (combined on and off premises establishments) are positively associated
  with aggravated assault rates, with each unit increase in outlet density associated with a 36% increase
  in assault incidence. This reflects how the built environment shapes violence through alcohol availability.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism properly locates the cause in neighborhood-level ecological structures
    (alcohol outlet density) rather than individual behavior. The clustering of alcohol outlets in disadvantaged
    communities reflects zoning policies and economic disinvestment that create differential exposure
    to violence risk. Equity implications: Poor and socially isolated communities bear disproportionate
    burden of both outlet concentration and resulting violence.'
