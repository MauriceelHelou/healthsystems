direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of legal cannabis retailers increases population-level access to cannabis products'
- 'Step 2: Increased access leads to higher rates of cannabis consumption across the population'
- 'Step 3: Higher consumption rates increase probability of acute adverse events including vomiting, psychosis'
- 'Step 4: Acute adverse events require emergency medical care, increasing ED presentations'

description: Analysis of 855,630 ED presentations found that increased legal cannabis availability is
  linked to health-related outcomes including vomiting, psychosis, and cannabis-involved presentations
  to emergency departments.

  description: Groups with less prior cannabis exposure may be more susceptible to acute adverse effects
    due to lack of tolerance or experience with dosing
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how the commercial cannabis environment creates population-level
    health system burden. The structural determinant is the regulatory framework allowing retail concentration,
    which then produces downstream healthcare utilization. This avoids blaming individual users by focusing
    on how market structure shapes health outcomes.
