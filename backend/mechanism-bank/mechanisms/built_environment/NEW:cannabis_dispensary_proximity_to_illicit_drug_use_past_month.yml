direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater proximity to cannabis dispensaries (shorter distances to nearest outlet) increases
  spatial accessibility'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced accessibility reduces time and transportation costs for obtaining cannabis'
- 'Step 3: Lower barriers facilitate more frequent purchasing opportunities and impulse purchases'
- 'Step 4: Geographic accessibility enables transition from occasional to daily/near-daily cannabis use
  patterns'

description: Proximity to cannabis dispensaries (a measure of accessibility) was associated with daily/near-daily
  cannabis use in Washington State's early non-medical cannabis market. This suggests that spatial accessibility
  enables higher frequency consumption patterns distinct from the availability-regular use pathway.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Proximity measures detected greater density in urban areas compared to suburban/rural
    areas. The association between proximity and daily/near-daily use suggests accessibility may be particularly
    important for high-frequency consumption patterns.
moderators:
- name: urbanicity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Urban areas have closer proximity to dispensaries, potentially strengthening the accessibility-use
    relationship in these contexts
- name: frequency_of_use
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Proximity was specifically associated with daily/near-daily use rather than monthly/bimonthly
    use, suggesting accessibility is more relevant for frequent users
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The proximity mechanism highlights how built environment characteristics shape
    health behaviors through structural accessibility rather than individual predisposition. Policy implications
    include minimum distance requirements between dispensaries as structural interventions. The differential
    impact across urban-rural contexts suggests potential equity considerations in how zoning and licensing
    decisions distribute exposure across communities.
