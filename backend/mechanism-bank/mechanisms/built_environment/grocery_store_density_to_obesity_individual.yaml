direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher grocery store density increases physical access to retail outlets
  selling fresh, unprocessed foods in the neighborhood environment'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability of healthy food options reduces barriers to purchasing
  nutritious foods including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains'
- 'Step 3: Improved access leads to changes in dietary behavior, with increased consumption
  of healthier food options'
- 'Step 4: Sustained healthier dietary patterns result in reduced caloric intake from
  processed foods and improved nutritional quality'
- 'Step 5: Better nutrition outcomes translate to lower rates of obesity and improved
  body mass index at the individual level'

description: Systematic review evidence from 74 studies in LMICs demonstrates that
  neighborhood food availability characteristics are consistently associated with
  dietary behavior (14 studies, 10 good quality) and the balance of evidence supports
  associations with health and nutrition outcomes including obesity (17 of 24 relevant
  studies). The pathway operates through increased physical access to healthy food
  retail, which facilitates healthier purchasing and consumption patterns, ultimately
  improving nutrition and weight outcomes.
