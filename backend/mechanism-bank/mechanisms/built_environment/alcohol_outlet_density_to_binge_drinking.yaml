direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density increases physical availability and accessibility
  of alcohol in communities'
- 'Step 2: Increased accessibility reduces barriers to alcohol acquisition and creates
  more opportunities for alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Greater access and availability leads to increased binge drinking behaviors,
  particularly among adolescents and young adults'

description: Higher alcohol outlet density increases binge drinking prevalence through
  enhanced physical availability and accessibility of alcohol. Studies consistently
  show positive associations between outlet density and binge drinking behaviors,
  particularly among adolescents and young adults. The mechanism operates through
  reduced barriers to alcohol acquisition and increased opportunities for consumption
  in high-density areas.
structural_competency_notes: Alcohol outlet density represents a structural determinant
  that shapes drinking environments and behaviors at the community level. Regulatory
  policies controlling outlet density can serve as population-level interventions
  to reduce binge drinking, particularly important for protecting vulnerable populations
  like adolescents who may have limited mobility to seek alcohol beyond their local
  communities.
