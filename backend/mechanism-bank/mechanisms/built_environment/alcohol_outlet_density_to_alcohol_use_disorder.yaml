to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- Higher density of alcohol outlets increases physical availability and accessibility
  of alcohol in neighborhoods
- Increased accessibility facilitates both initiation and maintenance of problematic
  drinking patterns, particularly among genetically vulnerable individuals
- Enhanced exposure to alcohol availability leads to increased risk of developing
  alcohol use disorder, with effects varying by individual and environmental factors

description: Higher alcohol outlet density increases the risk of alcohol use disorder
  onset through increased physical availability and accessibility. The relationship
  is particularly strong among individuals with genetic predisposition (heritability
  increases from 11% in areas with no outlets to 78% in high-density areas) and varies
  by demographic factors including sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Cosibling analyses
  support causal interpretation by controlling for shared genetic and environmental
  factors.
structural_competency_notes: Alcohol outlet density reflects structural policy decisions
  about zoning, licensing, and commercial regulation. Effects are moderated by neighborhood
  income, social control factors, and demographic composition, highlighting how structural
  inequities in alcohol retail environments can differentially impact vulnerable populations.
