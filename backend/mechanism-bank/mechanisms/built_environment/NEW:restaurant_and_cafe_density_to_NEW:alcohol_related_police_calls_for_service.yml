direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restaurants and cafes provide alcohol alongside food in dining-focused environments'
- 'Step 2: Food consumption with alcohol slows absorption and reduces intoxication levels'
- 'Step 3: Social norms in restaurants emphasize moderate drinking in meal contexts rather than heavy
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced intoxication and social control in these settings leads to fewer alcohol-related incidents'

description: Higher restaurant and cafe density is negatively associated with alcohol-related police calls-for-service.
  These venues promote moderate alcohol consumption in meal contexts with social controls that reduce
  problematic drinking behaviors.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 552
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: This protective effect was observed in Valencia, Spain. The relationship between restaurant/cafe
    density and alcohol-related calls may vary by cultural drinking patterns.

  description: Restaurant and cafe density was higher in areas with higher spatially-lagged economic status,
    suggesting neighborhood affluence of surrounding areas matters
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The protective effect of restaurants versus bars reflects how alcohol licensing
    and zoning categories create different risk environments. Policy distinctions between venue types
    have real public health consequences. This mechanism demonstrates that not all alcohol availability
    is equal - the context of consumption matters for neighborhood safety.
