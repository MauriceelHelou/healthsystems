  node_name: Natural Gas Consumption
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Electricity prices increase in the market'
- 'Step 2: Higher electricity costs make natural gas relatively more attractive as an energy source'
- 'Step 3: Consumers and industries substitute toward natural gas for heating, cooking, and industrial
  processes'
- 'Step 4: Natural gas consumption increases (cross-price elasticity 2.122 short-run, 1.884 long-run)'

description: Electricity and natural gas show a strong positive cross-price elasticity, with values of
  2.122 (short-run) and 1.884 (long-run), indicating these are substitute energy sources. Rising electricity
  prices significantly increase natural gas demand.

  description: Long-run elasticity (1.884) slightly lower than short-run (2.122), but both indicate strong
    substitution
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Energy substitution patterns have implications for household energy security and
    heating/cooling adequacy, which relate to health outcomes. Higher electricity prices may push households
    toward natural gas, affecting indoor air quality and energy poverty differently across income groups.
