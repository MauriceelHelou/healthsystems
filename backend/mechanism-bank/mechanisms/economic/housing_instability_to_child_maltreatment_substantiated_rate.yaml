direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates chronic stress for caregivers through uncertainty
  about meeting basic shelter needs, fear of eviction, and frequent moves'
- 'Step 2: This chronic stress depletes caregiver psychological and emotional resources,
  reducing capacity for responsive and consistent parenting'
- 'Step 3: Material hardship from housing costs may force trade-offs with other basic
  needs (food, healthcare, childcare), further straining family functioning'
- 'Step 4: Housing instability disrupts social support networks and community ties
  that serve as protective factors against maltreatment'
- 'Step 5: Diminished caregiver capacity combined with increased family stress elevates
  risk of abuse and neglect behaviors'
- 'Step 6: These maltreatment incidents are reported to child protective services,
  investigated, and substantiated at higher rates among housing-unstable families'

description: This systematic review of 21 studies demonstrates that housing stress,
  including housing instability, is consistently associated with increased likelihood
  of substantiated child protective services reports. Housing instability functions
  as a form of material hardship that serves as a more direct measure of how poverty
  affects daily family life compared to income alone. The pathway operates through
  increased caregiver stress, depleted resources for adequate child supervision and
  care, and disruption of protective social networks.
