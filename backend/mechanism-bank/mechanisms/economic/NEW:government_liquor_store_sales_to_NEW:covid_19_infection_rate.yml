mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government liquor stores serve as primary retail channel for off-premise alcohol sales in Canadian
  provinces'
- 'Step 2: Increased sales from government stores lead to higher at-home alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Home consumption may involve household mixing or social gatherings that violate distancing
  guidelines'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol impairs judgment about COVID-19 precautions and may encourage risky social behaviors'
- 'Step 5: COVID-19 infections increase 2 weeks following elevated government store sales'

description: Sales from government-operated liquor stores predicted COVID-19 infections 2 weeks later,
  with a 6.49% increase per standard drink/person/week. This effect size was much smaller than on-premise
  sales but still statistically significant, suggesting off-premise consumption also contributed to transmission.

  variation_notes: Canadian provincial government alcohol monopolies have different structures across
    Ontario, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the role of government alcohol retail monopolies as structural
    determinants of both alcohol consumption and downstream health outcomes. The Canadian provincial government
    liquor store system provides unique data for tracking population-level consumption, while also raising
    questions about government revenue interests versus public health protection. Policy decisions to
    expand delivery options during COVID-19 may have prioritized revenue or alcohol access over infection
    control.
