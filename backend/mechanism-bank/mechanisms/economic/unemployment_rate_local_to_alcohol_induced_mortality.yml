category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unemployment leads to loss of income, health insurance access, and daily structure'
- 'Step 2: Loss of employment-based social networks and occupational role contributes to social isolation'
- 'Step 3: Economic and psychosocial stressors increase risk of problematic alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Women may face unique barriers to accessing substance use treatment while unemployed'
- 'Step 5: Untreated alcohol use disorder progresses to fatal alcohol-attributable conditions'

description: Sex-stratified analysis specifically for women found that unemployed women have 3.64 times
  higher risk of alcohol-attributable mortality compared to employed women. This analysis included approximately
  14.4 million women with 3,147 alcohol-attributable deaths.

  equity_implications: The sex-stratified analysis acknowledges that unemployment may operate differently
    across gender due to structural factors including differential labor market participation, caregiving
    responsibilities, access to treatment, and social support systems. Women's lower but still substantially
    elevated risk may reflect both protective factors (stronger social networks) and additional barriers
    (stigma around women's alcohol use, childcare responsibilities limiting treatment access).
