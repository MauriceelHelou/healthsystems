direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher national GDP per capita reflects greater economic development and resources'
- 'Step 2: Economic development associated with longer-established drug markets and drug use patterns'
- 'Step 3: More developed economies may have aging populations of people who inject drugs who initiated
  use decades ago'
- 'Step 4: Longer injecting duration reflects populations with established, chronic drug use patterns'

description: Higher GDP per capita at the country level is associated with longer median injecting duration
  among people who inject drugs, with each $1000 GDP increase corresponding to 0.11 years longer injecting
  duration.

  variation_notes: Effect observed at country level with substantial regional variation; highest percentage
    of young PWID in eastern Europe (43.4%), lowest in Middle East and North Africa (6.9%)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces drug use patterns to macroeconomic conditions rather than
    individual choices. National economic development shapes the epidemiology of injecting drug use through
    historical, market, and demographic forces beyond individual control.
