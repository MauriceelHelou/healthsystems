direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Natural gas prices increase in the market'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices increase household and industrial energy costs'
- 'Step 3: Consumers reduce natural gas consumption in the short-term due to price sensitivity (elasticity
  -1.521)'
- 'Step 4: Reduced natural gas use may lead to substitution with alternative fuels or energy conservation'

description: This meta-regression analysis finds that natural gas consumption in China responds negatively
  to own-price changes in the short-term, with a mean elasticity of -1.521, indicating elastic demand.
  In the long-run, the elasticity becomes positive (0.410), suggesting complex adjustment dynamics over
  time.

  variation_notes: The paper explicitly notes that heterogeneity in estimates can be explained by geographical
    region, type of data, sample period, models of analysis, and type of consumer.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this paper focuses on energy economics rather than direct health outcomes,
    energy pricing and consumption patterns have indirect health implications through air quality, heating/cooling
    adequacy, and energy poverty. The structural factors identified (data type, sample period, analytical
    models, geography, consumer type) represent important contextual determinants. However, this paper
    does not directly examine health equity implications.
