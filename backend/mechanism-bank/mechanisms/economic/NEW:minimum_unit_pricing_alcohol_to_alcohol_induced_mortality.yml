to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_induced_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Induced Mortality
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing establishes a price floor for alcohol based on alcohol content'
- 'Step 2: Cheap high-strength alcohol products become relatively more expensive'
- 'Step 3: Heavy drinkers who consume cheap high-strength products reduce consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced consumption of harmful quantities decreases alcohol-induced mortality'

description: Minimum unit pricing is identified as a successful control measure that reduces alcohol-related
  harms by making cheap high-strength alcohol less affordable
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Paper explicitly identifies minimum unit pricing as a successful control measure that
    might be more widely applied, suggesting geographic variation in current implementation

  description: Heavy drinkers consuming cheap products show greatest response to minimum pricing
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Minimum unit pricing is a structural intervention that addresses the commercial
    determinants of health. It recognizes that the alcohol industry strategically prices products to maximize
    consumption, particularly among heavy drinkers and those with lower incomes. This policy approach
    targets the commercial environment rather than individual behavior.
