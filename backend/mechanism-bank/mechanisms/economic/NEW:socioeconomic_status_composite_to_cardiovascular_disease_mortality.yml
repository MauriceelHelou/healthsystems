mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low SES men face material disadvantage affecting living conditions and diet quality'
- 'Step 2: Occupational exposures in low-wage jobs may increase cardiovascular risk'
- 'Step 3: Economic stress and job insecurity contribute to chronic physiological stress'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to preventive care reduces early detection of CVD risk factors'
- 'Step 5: Delayed treatment and accumulated risk factors increase CVD events'

description: Men of low socioeconomic status have a 45% increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared
  to men of high SES. While significant, this effect is smaller than observed in women (79% increase),
  though the difference between sexes was not statistically significant.

  equity_implications: The socioeconomic gradient in men's CVD risk reflects structural inequalities in
    economic opportunity, working conditions, and healthcare access. While the relative risk is lower
    than for women, low-SES men still face substantial excess cardiovascular risk due to their position
    in social hierarchies that determine access to health-promoting resources.
