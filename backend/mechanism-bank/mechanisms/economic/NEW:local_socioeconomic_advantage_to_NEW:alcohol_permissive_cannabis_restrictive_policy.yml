  node_name: Alcohol Permissive Cannabis Restrictive Policy Pattern
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomically advantaged communities have established alcohol retail markets generating
  local tax revenue'
- 'Step 2: Economic interests favor maintaining permissive alcohol policies that benefit existing businesses'
- 'Step 3: Cannabis is perceived as new market threat or socially undesirable in advantaged communities'
- 'Step 4: Political power in advantaged areas enables restriction of cannabis while preserving alcohol
  access'
- 'Step 5: Results in policy pattern that is permissive on alcohol but restrictive on cannabis (51% of
  localities)'

description: Socioeconomically advantaged localities in California were more likely to adopt policies
  permissive on alcohol but restrictive on cannabis (51% of sample), suggesting that economic and political
  power enables selective substance regulation that may protect established alcohol markets.

  variation_notes: 51% of California localities studied exhibited this alcohol-permissive/cannabis-restrictive
    pattern, characterized by higher socioeconomic advantage.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how socioeconomic advantage translates into differential
    policy-making power. Advantaged communities can restrict new substances (cannabis) while maintaining
    access to established substances (alcohol), potentially reflecting class-based preferences rather
    than public health evidence. This creates structural inequities in how substance regulation is applied
    across communities.
