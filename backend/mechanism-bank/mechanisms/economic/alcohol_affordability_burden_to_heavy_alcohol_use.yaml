to_node:
  node_id: heavy_alcohol_use
  node_name: Heavy Alcohol Use Prevalence
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol affordability burden (increased prices/taxes relative to
  income) creates financial constraints on alcohol purchasing'
- 'Step 2: Price elasticity of demand leads consumers to reduce alcohol consumption
  as prices increase, with demand being consistently inelastic but responsive'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption manifests as decreased prevalence of heavy
  alcohol use patterns at the population level'

description: Higher alcohol affordability burden consistently reduces heavy alcohol
  use through price elasticity mechanisms. Meta-analyses demonstrate that increased
  alcohol prices and taxes significantly decrease heavy drinking patterns, with elasticity
  estimates around -0.28 for heavy drinking specifically. This relationship is mediated
  by economic constraints that make alcohol less accessible to consumers, particularly
  affecting those with lower disposable income.
structural_competency_notes: The relationship between affordability burden and heavy
  alcohol use operates within structural economic contexts where pricing policies
  differentially impact populations based on income levels and socioeconomic status.
  Lower-income groups face greater relative affordability burdens, making price-based
  interventions particularly effective but potentially inequitable in terms of access
  restrictions.
