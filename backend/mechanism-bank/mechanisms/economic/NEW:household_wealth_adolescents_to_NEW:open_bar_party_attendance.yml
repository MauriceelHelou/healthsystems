  equity_implications: This finding challenges assumptions that substance use harms only affect lower-income
    populations. It demonstrates how commercial alcohol environments may differentially target or be accessed
    by higher-SES youth, requiring policy approaches that address commercial determinants across socioeconomic
    strata.
