mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Perceived threat of job loss creates chronic psychological stress and anxiety'
- 'Step 2: Stress activates threat-rigidity responses reducing cognitive resources available for work
  tasks'
- 'Step 3: Reduced psychological resources impair concentration, motivation, and task engagement'
- 'Step 4: Conservation of resources theory suggests employees withdraw effort to protect remaining resources'
- 'Step 5: Decreased effort and engagement manifest as reduced in-role job performance'

  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural labor market conditions and employer practices
    that create precarious employment. The focus is on how structural economic insecurity—not individual
    worker deficits—impairs performance. Equity implications include disproportionate exposure to job
    insecurity among marginalized workers in precarious sectors.
