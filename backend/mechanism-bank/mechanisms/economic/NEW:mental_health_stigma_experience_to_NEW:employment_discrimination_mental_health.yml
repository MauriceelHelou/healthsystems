  equity_implications: Employment discrimination reflects structural barriers embedded in hiring practices
    and workplace policies rather than individual employability deficits. Structural solutions include
    ban-the-box legislation, employer education programs, supported employment initiatives, and anti-discrimination
    enforcement for justice-involved individuals with mental health conditions.
