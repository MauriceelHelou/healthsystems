description: Cost is identified as a key barrier preventing probation clients from accessing OUD medications,
  reflecting economic constraints that disproportionately affect justice-involved populations.

  sample_size: 26
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cost barriers reflect the intersection of criminal justice involvement with economic
    marginalization. Justice-involved individuals often face employment discrimination, reduced earning
    potential, and limited insurance access, compounding their inability to afford treatment. This economic
    exclusion from healthcare represents a structural determinant of health inequity.
