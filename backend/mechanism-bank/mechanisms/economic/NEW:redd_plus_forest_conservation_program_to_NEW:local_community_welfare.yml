- 'Step 1: REDD+ programs provide payment flows to local communities for forest conservation activities'
- 'Step 2: Payment mechanisms create alternative income sources for forest-dependent populations'
- 'Step 3: Program implementation may generate local employment in monitoring and enforcement'
- 'Step 4: Communities receive welfare-neutral to slightly positive socioeconomic benefits'
- 'Step 5: Minor welfare gains accrue to local populations but remain modest in magnitude'

description: Meta-analysis found socioeconomic impacts of REDD+ programs were welfare-neutral to slightly
  positive for local populations. The 12 socioeconomic effect sizes analyzed showed that while programs
  did not harm local communities, the welfare benefits were minor rather than transformative. This suggests
  that current REDD+ implementation delivers limited co-benefits beyond environmental outcomes.

  variation_notes: Welfare impacts likely vary by national vs. subnational program implementation and
    by the specific design of benefit-sharing mechanisms in different jurisdictions

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism examines how international climate policy interventions affect local
    community welfare, representing a structural determinant pathway. The finding of only minor welfare
    gains highlights potential equity concerns - forest-dependent communities bear conservation restrictions
    while receiving limited economic benefits. The structural design of payment mechanisms and benefit-sharing
    arrangements determines whether welfare gains reach marginalized populations or are captured by more
    powerful actors. Future jurisdictional approaches should consider equity implications in program design.
