mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates severe material hardship and housing instability for
  families with children, disrupting stable caregiving environments'
- 'Step 2: Housing stress increases parental stress, mental health challenges, and
  reduces parental capacity for adequate supervision and nurturing care'
- 'Step 3: Homeless families face resource scarcity, social isolation, and chaotic
  living conditions (shelters, doubled-up arrangements) that compromise child safety'
- 'Step 4: Increased family stress and reduced parenting capacity elevates risk of
  neglect and physical maltreatment incidents'
- 'Step 5: Families experiencing homelessness have increased contact with social services
  and mandated reporters, leading to higher CPS reports, investigations, and substantiated
  maltreatment findings'

description: This systematic review of 21 U.S. studies found consistent evidence that
  housing stress, including homelessness and eviction, is associated with increased
  likelihood of child maltreatment across multiple outcome measures including CPS
  reports, investigated and substantiated CPS reports, out-of-home placements, and
  maltreatment death. Housing stress serves as a form of material hardship that more
  directly measures how poverty affects daily caregiving capacity.
