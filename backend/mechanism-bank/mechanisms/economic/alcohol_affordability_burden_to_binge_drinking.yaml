from_node:
  node_id: alcohol_affordability_burden
  node_name: Alcohol Affordability Burden
to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking Prevalence
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol affordability burden (increased prices/taxes relative to
  income) creates economic barriers to alcohol access'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints reduce frequency and quantity of alcohol purchases,
  particularly affecting episodic high-volume consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol accessibility and consumption capacity leads to decreased
  prevalence of binge drinking behaviors in the population'

description: Higher alcohol affordability burden (increased prices and taxes relative
  to income) significantly reduces binge drinking prevalence through economic accessibility
  mechanisms. Systematic reviews demonstrate consistent negative price elasticities
  for heavy episodic drinking, with total own-price elasticities ranging from -0.3
  to -0.65 across beverage types. This relationship operates through reduced purchasing
  power and accessibility, particularly affecting high-volume consumption episodes
  that characterize binge drinking patterns.
structural_competency_notes: This mechanism demonstrates how economic policy interventions
  (taxation, pricing) can serve as structural determinants of health behavior. The
  relationship may vary by socioeconomic status, with affordability burden having
  differential impacts across income levels, potentially creating disparate effects
  on drinking patterns within populations.
