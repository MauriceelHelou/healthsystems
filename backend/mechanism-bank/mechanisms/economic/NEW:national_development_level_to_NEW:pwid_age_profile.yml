- 'Step 1: National development indicators (GDP, urbanization) reflect macroeconomic and demographic structures'
- 'Step 2: These structures shape drug market evolution, healthcare access, and population demographics'
- 'Step 3: Development level influences survival rates and duration of drug use careers'
- 'Step 4: Age profile of PWID population reflects cumulative structural determinants over time'

description: Globally, 25.3% of people who inject drugs are aged 25 or younger, with substantial variation
  by national development level and region. GDP and urbanization, but not inequality or treatment coverage,
  were associated with age profile.

  variation_notes: 'Global estimate: 25.3% (95% UI 19.6-31.8) of PWID aged ≤25 years; substantial regional
    variation from 6.9% (Middle East/North Africa) to 43.4% (Eastern Europe)'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This analysis demonstrates that the demographics of drug-using populations are
    shaped by macroeconomic structures rather than individual characteristics. The lack of association
    with treatment coverage suggests structural factors beyond healthcare access determine age profiles.
