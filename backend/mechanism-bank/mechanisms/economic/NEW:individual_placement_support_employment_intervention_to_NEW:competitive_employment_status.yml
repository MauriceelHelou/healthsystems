  node_id: NEW:competitive_employment_status
  node_name: Competitive Employment Status
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IPS provides integrated employment support within addiction treatment settings for individuals
  with alcohol/drug dependence'
- 'Step 2: Employment specialists conduct rapid job search aligned with client preferences rather than
  prevocational training'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing support during job placement and retention (up to 4 months in-work support) addresses
  barriers'
- 'Step 4: Integration with treatment-as-usual addresses substance use while simultaneously pursuing employment'
- 'Step 5: Competitive employment in open job market achieved, verified through tax and benefit database
  linkage'

description: Individual Placement and Support (IPS), an evidence-based supported employment model, integrated
  with addiction treatment-as-usual, is hypothesized to increase competitive employment rates among people
  with alcohol and drug dependence compared to standard employment support alone.

  description: Study includes AUD, OUD, and other drug use disorders; effectiveness may vary by primary

  strength: moderate
  description: Eligibility requires 6+ months unemployment or economic inactivity; longer duration may
    present additional barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural barrier of unemployment among people with
    substance use disorders by providing integrated vocational support rather than treating employment
    as secondary to treatment completion. The intervention recognizes that traditional addiction treatment
    programs offer ineffective employment support, perpetuating economic marginalization. By targeting
    the structural exclusion of this population from competitive employment, IPS addresses a key social
    determinant affecting health equity.
