description: The growth of precarious employment arrangements including outsourcing, temporary work, and
  international supply chains creates challenges for occupational health and safety regulation. These
  new forms of work may not be adequately covered by existing OHS legislation, leaving workers more vulnerable
  to occupational hazards.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies economic globalization and neoliberal policy as root
    causes of increased occupational health risks, avoiding blame on individual workers who accept precarious
    employment out of economic necessity. It highlights how macro-economic forces create differential
    vulnerability to workplace hazards based on employment status.
