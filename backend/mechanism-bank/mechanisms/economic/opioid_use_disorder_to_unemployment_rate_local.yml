- 'Step 1: Opioid use disorder creates functional limitations affecting employment capacity'
- 'Step 2: Criminal justice involvement associated with OUD creates additional employment barriers'
- 'Step 3: Medication treatment requirements may conflict with inflexible work schedules'

- 'Step 5: Extended periods of economic inactivity (6+ months) make re-entry increasingly difficult'
