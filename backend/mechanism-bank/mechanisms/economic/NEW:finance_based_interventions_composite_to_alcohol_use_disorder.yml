mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Finance-based interventions including representative payeeship modify access to and management
  of financial resources'
- 'Step 2: Structured financial management reduces availability of discretionary funds for alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 3: Financial constraints during high-risk periods (e.g., benefit receipt days) limit alcohol access'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases risk of maintaining or worsening alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 5: Improved financial stability supports sustained engagement with alcohol treatment services'

description: The systematic review found Level II-V evidence that finance-based interventions can improve
  outcomes among adults with behavioral health conditions including substance use disorders such as alcohol
  use disorder. The strongest evidence was for representative payeeship programs in reducing substance
  use.

  description: Individuals with co-occurring mental disorders and substance use disorders may particularly
    benefit from structured financial interventions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers alcohol use disorder within economic and structural contexts
    rather than framing it purely as individual pathology. It recognizes that economic resources and their
    management are structurally shaped and that interventions modifying these structures can improve health
    outcomes. This approach aligns with harm reduction principles and avoids moral judgment about alcohol
    use.
