description: The study identifies aggressive packaging and marketing tendencies by the alcohol industry
  as key structural factors that maintained alcohol availability to underage populations despite the sachet
  ban. Industry practices circumvented policy intentions by adapting product formats while maintaining
  affordability.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately identifies corporate marketing practices as structural
    determinants of adolescent alcohol use rather than focusing on individual choice. The study reveals
    how commercial determinants of health operate to undermine public health policies. Equity implications
    include targeting of low-income populations through affordability strategies, creating socioeconomic
    disparities in alcohol-related harm.
