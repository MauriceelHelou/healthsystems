description: Importantly, this systematic review found that retirement itself does NOT increase risk for
  late-onset AUD or heavy drinking, contrary to common preconceptions. This represents a null finding
  that challenges stereotypes about older adult drinking.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding is important for structural competency as it challenges ageist assumptions
    that retirement inherently leads to problematic drinking. The review notes that 'most studies base
    their conclusions on a certain preconception of older adults with alcohol problems, which leads to
    a row of circular arguments.' This highlights how research biases can perpetuate harmful stereotypes.
