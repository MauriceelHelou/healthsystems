- 'Step 1: Persistent precarious employment reflects structural shift toward less secure employment forms'
- 'Step 2: Job insecurity creates chronic stress activation and elevated cortisol'
- 'Step 3: Lack of paid sick leave and healthcare benefits reduces preventive care and treatment access'
- 'Step 4: Income instability limits investments in nutrition, housing quality, and health-promoting behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Multiple pathway effects converge to produce poorer overall health status'

description: The systematic review found persistent precarious employment was associated with poorer health
  across multiple domains including mental health, general health, physical health, and health behaviors.
  The overall conclusion is that precarious employment harms health, though causality remains uncertain
  due to methodological limitations in available studies.

  strength: moderate
  description: Authors explicitly note associations were strongest for outcomes with short time lags

  strength: moderate
  description: Risk of bias was generally high (n=18 studies) and GRADE certainty was very low across
    all outcomes, suggesting true effects may differ from observed
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This review explicitly frames precarious employment as a structural determinant
    reflecting 'a shift towards less secure forms of employment' - appropriately locating the problem
    in labor market transformations rather than individual worker characteristics. The authors' recommendation
    to explore 'precautionary labour regulations and employment policies' demonstrates structural competency
    by identifying policy levers rather than individual behavior change as the appropriate intervention
    level.
