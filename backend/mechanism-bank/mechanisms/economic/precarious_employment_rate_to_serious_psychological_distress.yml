mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persistent precarious employment creates ongoing uncertainty about employment continuity and
  income'
- 'Step 2: Chronic uncertainty triggers sustained psychological stress and anxiety responses'
- 'Step 3: Irregular schedules and income volatility disrupt sleep, social relationships, and daily routines'
- 'Step 4: Limited control over work conditions reduces sense of agency and increases hopelessness'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative psychological burden manifests as clinically significant mental health symptoms'

description: Persistent precarious employment is associated with 44% increased odds of mental health symptoms
  compared to stable employment. Mental health was the most commonly reported outcome domain in this systematic
  review, suggesting this is a primary pathway through which employment precarity affects health.

  description: Mental health outcomes show stronger associations likely due to shorter time lags between
    exposure and outcome
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Mental health symptoms are framed as downstream consequences of structural labor
    market conditions rather than individual vulnerability. The mechanism pathway emphasizes how employment
    structures create conditions that undermine psychological wellbeing through lack of control, unpredictability,
    and disrupted social functioning. This appropriately locates the problem in employment arrangements
    that can be addressed through policy intervention.
