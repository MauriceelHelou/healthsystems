  node_id: NEW:natural_gas_consumption
  node_name: Natural Gas Consumption
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Coal prices change in the energy market'
- 'Step 2: Coal serves as a substitute fuel for natural gas in many applications'
- 'Step 3: In the short-term, higher coal prices lead to decreased natural gas consumption (cross-price
  elasticity -0.762)'
- 'Step 4: This counterintuitive short-term relationship may reflect market dynamics and adjustment costs'

description: The cross-price elasticity between coal and natural gas shows a negative short-run relationship
  (-0.762), becoming near-zero in the long-run (0.008). This suggests complex substitution dynamics between
  these fuel sources in China's energy market.

  description: Long-run cross-price elasticity (0.008) is near zero, differing substantially from short-run
    elasticity (-0.762)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Coal-to-gas substitution has significant air quality and health implications. Lower
    coal consumption generally improves ambient air quality and reduces respiratory health burdens. However,
    this paper focuses on economic relationships rather than health outcomes directly.
