direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher income inequality at population level creates relative deprivation and psychosocial
  stress'
- 'Step 2: Unequal income distribution leads to underinvestment in public goods and social infrastructure'
- 'Step 3: Reduced social cohesion and trust in communities with high inequality'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress exposure and reduced access to health-promoting resources'
- 'Step 5: Increased perception of poor health status among population'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis found a small but statistically significant association
  between income inequality (measured by Gini coefficient) and poor self-rated health. Per 0.05-unit increase
  in the Gini coefficient, the odds ratio for poor self-rated health was 1.06 (95% CI: 1.03-1.08). The
  evidence was rated as very low certainty due to serious risk of bias in 63.2% of studies. The review
  found evidence supporting temporality and plausibility Bradford Hill viewpoints, but could not establish
  causality due to methodological limitations.'

  variation_notes: The review notes that very few studies examined income inequality at the national level
    versus subnational levels, suggesting geographic variation in measurement and effects. The evidence
    base was noted as methodologically limited with different findings across study contexts.

  description: 63.2% of SRH studies were at serious risk of bias, suggesting effect estimates may be inflated

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism appropriately traces health outcomes to structural economic conditions
    (income distribution) rather than individual behaviors. The review explicitly uses multilevel analysis
    to separate contextual effects from individual-level factors. However, the finding of only small associations
    and high risk of bias suggests the pathway from inequality to health may be mediated by multiple intervening
    structural factors not fully captured. The equity implications are significant: income inequality
    disproportionately affects lower-income populations who experience both relative deprivation and reduced
    access to resources in high-inequality contexts.'
