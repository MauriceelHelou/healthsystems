direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term unemployment (≥6 months) creates sustained economic stress and loss of daily structure'
- 'Step 2: Loss of employment removes workplace social controls and time constraints on drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Economic strain and psychological distress increase maladaptive coping behaviors including
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged unemployment erodes social networks and increases social isolation, facilitating
  problematic drinking patterns'

description: Long-term unemployment increases the risk of binge drinking, supporting the causation hypothesis
  that unemployment alters drinking patterns. The effect holds after accounting for reciprocal causality
  and time-constant confounding through fixed-effects models.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies unemployment as a structural determinant of harmful alcohol
    use, shifting focus from individual choice to economic conditions. The finding that the effect persists
    after controlling for confounding suggests true causal impact of labor market exclusion on health
    behaviors. Policy implications include employment support and economic stability programs as alcohol
    harm reduction interventions.
