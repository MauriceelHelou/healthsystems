mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher income inequality creates differential access to health-promoting resources across socioeconomic
  strata'
- 'Step 2: Reduced public investment in health infrastructure, social services, and safety nets in high-inequality
  societies'
- 'Step 3: Psychosocial stress from relative deprivation and social comparison affects physiological systems'
- 'Step 4: Chronic disease development and progression through cumulative stress exposure and reduced
  healthcare access'
- 'Step 5: Elevated mortality risk across the population'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 14 cohort studies found a marginal association between income inequality
  and all-cause mortality. Per 0.05-unit increase in the Gini coefficient, the relative risk for mortality
  was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00-1.04), a very small effect that borders on null. The evidence was rated as low
  certainty, with 50% of studies at serious risk of bias. While temporality and plausibility Bradford
  Hill viewpoints were supported, the strength of association and dose-response gradient evidence was
  inconclusive due to methodological limitations.'

  variation_notes: Very few studies examined income inequality at the national level. The review identified
    a gap in natural experimental approaches that could address geographic and temporal confounding. Different
    subnational measurement levels may produce varying effect estimates.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism appropriately examines structural economic conditions as determinants
    of population health outcomes. The use of multilevel data separates contextual inequality effects
    from individual income effects, avoiding conflation of these distinct pathways. The very small effect
    size (RR 1.02) and wide confidence interval suggest that while income inequality may contribute to
    mortality, the direct causal pathway is not well-established with current methods. The review notes
    the need for natural experimental approaches to address confounding, acknowledging the complexity
    of structural determinants. Equity implications: even small effects at the population level translate
    to meaningful excess mortality when applied to large populations experiencing high inequality.'
