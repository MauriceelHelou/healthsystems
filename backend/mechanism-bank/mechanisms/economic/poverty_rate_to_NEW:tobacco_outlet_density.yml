direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Areas with higher income deprivation have lower commercial operating costs'
- 'Step 2: Higher perceived demand for tobacco products in deprived areas attracts retailers'
- 'Step 3: Less community capacity to regulate or limit tobacco retail presence'
- 'Step 4: Retail planning policies fail to account for health impacts of tobacco outlet concentration'
- 'Step 5: Result is disproportionate concentration of tobacco retailers in deprived neighbourhoods'

description: Neighbourhood-level income deprivation is positively associated with tobacco retailer density,
  with the most deprived quintile having the highest density of tobacco outlets and the least deprived
  having the lowest.

  variation_notes: Positive linear relationship observed across all deprivation quintiles in Scotland
    using national tobacco retailer register
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how poverty shapes commercial environments in ways
    that create health-harming exposures. The tobacco retail environment is a structural factor that perpetuates
    health inequities by concentrating harmful commodity access in already disadvantaged communities.
    Supply-side tobacco control policies should consider equity implications.
