  node_id: NEW:natural_gas_consumption
  node_name: Natural Gas Consumption
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oil prices increase in global and domestic markets'
- 'Step 2: Higher oil costs increase expenses for transportation, heating, and industrial processes using
  petroleum'
- 'Step 3: Natural gas becomes relatively more cost-effective as a substitute fuel'
- 'Step 4: Consumers and industries shift toward natural gas (cross-price elasticity 2.267 short-run,
  1.275 long-run)'

description: Oil and natural gas demonstrate strong positive cross-price elasticity, with the highest
  short-run value (2.267) among all cross-price relationships examined. This indicates oil and natural
  gas are significant substitutes in China's energy market.

  equity_implications: Oil-to-gas fuel switching has environmental health implications through changes
    in emissions profiles. Natural gas generally produces fewer particulate emissions than petroleum products,
    potentially improving air quality. However, this paper does not directly examine health equity dimensions
    of energy transitions.
