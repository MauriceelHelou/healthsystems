direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic instability limits ability to afford healthcare copays, transportation to appointments,
  and time off work/school'
- 'Step 2: Financial constraints may lead to delayed or incomplete treatment adherence'
- 'Step 3: Stress from economic insecurity may impair neurological recovery processes'
- 'Step 4: Limited resources restrict access to optimal recovery environments and supportive care'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative economic barriers extend clinical recovery duration'

description: Economic stability is identified as a social determinant of health that may impact clinical
  recovery from concussion. Low economic stability creates multiple barriers to optimal care and recovery
  environment, potentially extending recovery time for athletes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Economic stability as a determinant of health outcomes reflects structural inequities
    in wealth distribution, employment policies, and social safety nets. This mechanism appropriately
    identifies systemic economic factors rather than individual financial decisions as the root cause
    of differential recovery outcomes. Policy interventions addressing economic inequality could improve
    concussion outcomes across populations.
