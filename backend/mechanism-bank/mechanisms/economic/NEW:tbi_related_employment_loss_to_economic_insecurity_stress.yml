direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate to severe TBI leads to job loss or inability to work at pre-injury level (58% not
  employed post-injury)'
- 'Step 2: Loss of employment income creates financial strain for survivors and families'
- 'Step 3: Economic insecurity compounds psychological distress already associated with TBI'
- 'Step 4: Financial stress may limit access to ongoing rehabilitation and support services'
- 'Step 5: Economic hardship and stress create feedback loop worsening recovery and well-being'

description: With 57.8% of msTBI survivors unemployed post-injury, the economic consequences extend beyond
  individual survivors to affect family financial stability and long-term well-being. The abstract explicitly
  notes that returning to employment is 'critical for a survivor's well-being.'

  description: Unemployment decreases over time (65.1% at 1 year to 50.1% beyond 5 years), potentially
    reducing economic insecurity for some survivors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Economic insecurity following TBI reflects inadequate disability insurance systems,
    gaps in social safety nets, and lack of policies supporting injured workers. Those without access
    to disability benefits, savings, or family support face compounded vulnerability. Structural interventions
    including expanded disability coverage and income support could mitigate these effects.
