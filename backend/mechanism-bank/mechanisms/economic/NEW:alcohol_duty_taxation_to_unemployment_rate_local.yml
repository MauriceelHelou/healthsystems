- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol duties generate additional government revenue'
- 'Step 2: Government reallocates increased revenue to stimulate public expenditure'
- 'Step 3: Increased government spending creates demand across multiple economic sectors'
- 'Step 4: Economic activity and employment are stimulated through multiplier effects'
- 'Step 5: Net positive effect on employment despite reduced alcohol industry activity'

description: Contrary to conventional economic arguments against alcohol taxation, this study demonstrates
  that when increased alcohol duties are accompanied by reinvestment of revenues into government expenditure,
  there is no trade-off between employment and health - both improve simultaneously, creating a 'double
  dividend'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: UK-specific economic modeling; results depend on how government reinvests tax revenue
    and the structure of the national economy

    the economy rather than used for debt reduction or savings

    in other sectors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism challenges the structural argument often used against alcohol control
    policies - that they harm the economy and employment. By demonstrating that proper revenue reinvestment
    creates net positive economic effects, the study removes a key barrier to structural interventions
    on alcohol availability. The finding has equity implications as alcohol-related harms disproportionately
    affect lower-income populations.
