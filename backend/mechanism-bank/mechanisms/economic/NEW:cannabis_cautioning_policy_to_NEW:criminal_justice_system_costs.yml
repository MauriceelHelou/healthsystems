description: Cannabis cautioning reduces criminal justice system costs by approximately $345 per case
  compared to arrest (mean $388 vs $733), representing a statistically significant cost saving while achieving
  equivalent health outcomes.

  variation_notes: Cost data specific to Australian criminal justice and healthcare systems; costs would
    vary internationally
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that punitive drug policies impose
    unnecessary economic burden on public systems without corresponding health benefits. Resources saved
    through diversion could be redirected to treatment services or other public health interventions.
    This has equity implications as criminal justice costs are ultimately borne by taxpayers while disproportionately
    affecting low-income communities through fines and fees.
