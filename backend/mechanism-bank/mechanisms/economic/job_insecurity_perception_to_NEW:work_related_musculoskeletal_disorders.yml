mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Job insecurity creates chronic psychological stress and uncertainty about employment continuity'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress activates physiological stress responses including sustained muscle tension
  and inflammatory pathways'
- 'Step 3: Workers may adopt maladaptive coping behaviors or work through pain to demonstrate value to
  employers'
- 'Step 4: Sustained psychosocial stress combined with physical work demands leads to musculoskeletal
  tissue damage'
- 'Step 5: Upper limb and back regions experience cumulative strain resulting in musculoskeletal disorders'

description: This systematic review of 23 studies found that job insecurity should be considered a potential
  precursor of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, with 65.2% of studies showing statistically significant
  associations. The psychosocial stress of uncertain employment translates into physical health outcomes
  through stress-mediated pathways affecting musculoskeletal tissue, particularly in the upper limbs and
  back.

  description: Upper limbs and back were the body areas most affected by the association between job insecurity
    and MSDs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies job insecurity as a structural economic factor that produces
    health outcomes, rather than attributing MSDs solely to individual ergonomic behaviors. The increasing
    prevalence of precarious employment and labor market instability represents systemic economic conditions
    that create health inequities. Workers in less secure employment arrangements have less bargaining
    power to demand safer working conditions or adequate recovery time, creating differential vulnerability
    based on employment status and economic position.
