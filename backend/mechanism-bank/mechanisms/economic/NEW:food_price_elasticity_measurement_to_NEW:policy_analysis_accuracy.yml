mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Scanner data (household-level purchase records) generates different demand elasticity estimates
  compared to aggregate data sources'
- 'Step 2: Household scanner quantity data produces more elastic demand estimates than other quantity
  measurement types'
- 'Step 3: Retail scanner price data used as proxies for actual prices tend to show more price-elastic
  responses'
- 'Step 4: These methodological differences affect predictions of how price-based policies (taxes, subsidies)
  will influence food purchasing behavior'
- 'Step 5: Inaccurate elasticity selection can lead to over- or under-estimation of policy impacts on
  food consumption patterns'

description: This meta-analysis examines how the choice of data source affects estimates of food demand
  price elasticity in the U.S. The study finds that scanner data generate statistically different elasticity
  estimates, with demand appearing more elastic (more responsive to price changes) than estimates from
  other data types. This has important implications for health policy analysis, as elasticity estimates
  are used to predict how food taxes or subsidies will affect consumption of items like sugar-sweetened
  beverages, alcohol, and unhealthy foods. Selecting inappropriate elasticities could lead to inaccurate
  policy impact predictions.

  equity_implications: This methodological finding has important equity implications for food and beverage
    taxation policies aimed at improving population health. Price-based interventions (like soda taxes
    or alcohol taxes) are often critiqued as regressive, but their effectiveness depends on accurate elasticity
    estimates. If elasticities are systematically different depending on data source, policy analyses
    using the wrong estimates could either overestimate (leading to policy adoption with disappointing
    results) or underestimate (preventing adoption of effective policies) the impact of structural interventions
    on diet-related health outcomes. Low-income populations may be more price-sensitive, so accurate elasticity
    measurement is crucial for equitable policy design.
