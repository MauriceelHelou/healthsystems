- 'Step 1: Low socioeconomic status creates chronic stress and limited resources for coping'
- 'Step 2: Economic hardship limits access to healthy stress management options and mental health services'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress impairs emotion regulation capacity and autonomic nervous system functioning'
- 'Step 4: Substances may be used as accessible coping mechanism for managing distress'
- 'Step 5: This increases vulnerability to developing substance use disorders'

  distress, highlighting economic factors as structural determinants affecting women in SUD treatment.

  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes economic inequality as a root cause of substance use
    disorders. Low SES is identified as a sample characteristic alongside trauma and distress, indicating
    these structural factors cluster together. Treatment approaches must account for socioeconomic barriers
    and address social determinants alongside clinical interventions. Policy implications include poverty
    reduction and economic support as SUD prevention strategies.
