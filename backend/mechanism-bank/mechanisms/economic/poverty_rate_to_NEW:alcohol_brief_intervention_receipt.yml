description: The study explicitly focused on general practice clinics serving low-income communities,
  recognizing that these populations face barriers to receiving evidence-based alcohol interventions.
  The REACH intervention was designed to address these structural barriers by providing additional implementation
  support.

  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly addresses health equity by targeting intervention resources
    to low-income communities. Rather than attributing alcohol-related health disparities to individual
    choices, the study recognizes that structural factors including resource availability in healthcare
    settings create differential access to preventive interventions. The focus on implementation factors
    acknowledges that healthcare system capacity, not patient behavior, is the primary barrier.
