mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol taxes and prices reduce alcohol consumption including binge drinking'
- 'Step 2: Reduced binge drinking decreases acute alcohol toxicity and intoxication-related incidents'
- 'Step 3: Lower chronic consumption reduces cumulative organ damage and disease development'
- 'Step 4: Decreased consumption leads to reduced alcohol-related diseases (cirrhosis) and injuries (accidents,
  violence)'

description: A meta-analysis by Wagenaar and colleagues demonstrated that increased alcohol taxes and
  prices are associated with reduced alcohol-related disease and injury outcomes that are attributable
  to binge drinking. This extends the economic mechanism from consumption behavior to downstream health
  consequences.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how upstream economic policy (taxation) can prevent
    downstream health harms at a population level without requiring individual behavior change interventions.
    It represents a structural approach to alcohol-related health inequities by making harmful products
    less accessible through pricing rather than targeting individual choices.
