mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Income inequality creates differential access to life-sustaining resources
  including healthcare, nutrition, safe housing, and environmental quality'
- 'Step 2: Unequal societies may underinvest in public goods and social safety nets
  that protect health across the lifespan'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from social stratification and relative deprivation accelerates
  biological aging and disease processes through neuroendocrine and immune pathways'
- 'Step 4: Combined material deprivation, reduced access to preventive and curative
  healthcare, and chronic stress exposure increase mortality risk'
