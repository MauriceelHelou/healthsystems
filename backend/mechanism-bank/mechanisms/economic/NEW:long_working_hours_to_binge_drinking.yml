direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long working hours at baseline create sustained occupational stress exposure'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress and time pressure limit adoption of healthy coping strategies'
- 'Step 3: Over time, workers develop new alcohol use patterns that exceed recommended levels'
- 'Step 4: Prospective follow-up confirms temporal sequence from exposure to outcome'

description: Prospective analysis establishes temporal relationship between long working hours and subsequent
  development of risky alcohol use. The 12% increased odds of new onset risky alcohol use provides stronger
  causal evidence than cross-sectional data alone, confirming that long working hours precede and predict
  alcohol misuse.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The prospective design strengthens causal inference that work conditions drive
    health behaviors rather than selection effects. This supports structural interventions targeting workplace
    policies and labor regulations rather than individual-level health education approaches.
