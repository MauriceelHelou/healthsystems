direction: positive

- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to functional impairment affecting work capacity and reliability'
- 'Step 2: Stigma and discrimination in hiring practices create barriers to employment for individuals
  with AUD history'
- 'Step 3: Existing employment support in addiction treatment programs is ineffective at addressing vocational
  needs'

  market re-entry'
- 'Step 5: High prevalence of unemployment among AUD populations perpetuates economic disadvantage'

  and drug dependence, and that current employment support offered in addiction treatment programs is

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the failure of healthcare and social systems to provide
    effective employment support perpetuates unemployment among people with substance use disorders. The
    problem is not individual motivation but systemic inadequacy of vocational services. This structural
    gap creates and maintains economic inequality affecting a vulnerable population.
