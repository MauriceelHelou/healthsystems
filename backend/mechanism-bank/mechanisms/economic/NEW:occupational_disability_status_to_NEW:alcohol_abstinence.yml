- 'Step 1: Occupational disability often results from serious health conditions requiring medical management'
- 'Step 2: Medical conditions may contraindicate alcohol use or require medications incompatible with
  drinking'

- 'Step 4: Economic constraints from disability income may also limit alcohol purchasing'

description: Occupational disability is strongly associated with alcohol abstinence, reflecting the 'sick
  quitter' phenomenon where individuals with deteriorating health cease alcohol consumption. This represents
  the strongest association found in the study and highlights the importance of examining abstainers separately
  from moderate drinkers.

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how health-related labor market exit concentrates abstainers
    among the occupationally disabled. The strong association underscores that abstinence is not always
    a health-positive choice but may reflect underlying illness - important for interpreting epidemiological
    findings about alcohol and health that sometimes show J-shaped curves with abstainers appearing less
    healthy than moderate drinkers.
