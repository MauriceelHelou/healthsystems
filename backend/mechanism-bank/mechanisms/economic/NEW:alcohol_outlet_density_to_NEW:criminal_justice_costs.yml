direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density increases alcohol availability and consumption'
- 'Step 2: Increased consumption leads to more alcohol-related violence and homicides'
- 'Step 3: Each homicide generates substantial criminal justice system costs (investigation, prosecution,
  incarceration)'
- 'Step 4: Victims and families bear medical costs, lost productivity, and quality of life losses'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative costs to society are substantial and preventable through policy intervention'

description: Reducing alcohol outlet density by one quintile in Baltimore was associated with $63.7 million
  in prevented victim and criminal justice costs annually. Removing liquor stores from residential zones
  would save $27.5 million.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This economic analysis demonstrates the substantial societal costs of permissive
    alcohol zoning policies. The costs are disproportionately borne by communities with high outlet density,
    which are often lower-income and minority neighborhoods. This represents a structural transfer of
    costs to already disadvantaged communities through land use policy decisions.
