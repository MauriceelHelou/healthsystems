mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates chronic stress and uncertainty about basic needs'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress exacerbates existing mental health conditions or precipitates new ones'
- 'Step 3: Unstable housing disrupts access to mental health services and medication continuity'
- 'Step 4: Worsened mental health status impairs ability to manage HIV care'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Housing instability is a structural issue rooted in housing policy, affordable
    housing availability, and economic systems rather than individual choices. This mechanism demonstrates
    how upstream economic conditions cascade into health outcomes through mental health pathways.
