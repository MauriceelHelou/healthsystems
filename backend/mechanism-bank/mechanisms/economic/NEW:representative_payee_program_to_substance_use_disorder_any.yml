mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Representative payee program assigns a third party to manage disability or other benefit payments
  for individuals with behavioral health conditions'
- 'Step 2: Controlled disbursement of funds limits access to large sums of money that could be used to
  purchase substances'
- 'Step 3: Structured financial management reduces impulsive spending on drugs or alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Reduced substance availability and consumption leads to decreased substance use behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Improved financial stability supports engagement with treatment and recovery services'

description: Representative payee programs, where a designated third party manages financial benefits
  for individuals with mental disorders or substance use disorders, showed the strongest evidence for
  reducing substance use among finance-based interventions. This structural intervention addresses the
  relationship between financial access and substance purchasing behavior.

  description: Representative payeeship may be particularly effective for individuals whose substance
    use is closely tied to benefit payment timing
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that substance use among individuals with behavioral
    health conditions is often structurally linked to economic factors like benefit payment cycles. Rather
    than blaming individual decision-making, representative payeeship provides structural support that
    modifies the economic environment. However, it also raises equity concerns about autonomy and paternalism
    in managing finances for vulnerable populations.
