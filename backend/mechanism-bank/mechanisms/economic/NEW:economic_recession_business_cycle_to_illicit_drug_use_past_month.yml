direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic recessions create widespread macroeconomic instability affecting multiple dimensions
  of wellbeing'
- 'Step 2: Business cycle downturns reduce employment opportunities, income levels, and economic security
  for households'
- 'Step 3: Economic hardship increases stress, anxiety, and hopelessness particularly among vulnerable
  populations'
- 'Step 4: Reduced economic activity may decrease formal employment but increase informal/illegal market
  activity including drug markets'
- 'Step 5: Combination of increased demand from stress-related use and potential supply-side factors increases
  overall drug consumption'

description: The systematic review identifies economic recessions as impacting drug use through multiple
  channels with potentially conflicting outcomes, as reflected in the mixed findings across studies. While
  the overall conclusion supports countercyclical drug use (recessions boost drug use), the 13 studies
  with mixed results and 3 with procyclical findings suggest the relationship involves complex mechanisms
  that may vary by context, drug type, and population subgroup. The meta-analytic synthesis resolves this
  heterogeneity toward an overall positive relationship.

  variation_notes: Studies show heterogeneous results across different OECD countries and time periods,
    suggesting context-dependent relationships between business cycles and drug use

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately centers macroeconomic structures as the driver of
    population-level drug use patterns. The acknowledgment of multiple channels through which recessions
    impact drug use reflects structural complexity rather than simple individual-level explanations. Policy
    implications emphasize the need for prevention programs during economic downturns, recognizing that
    drug use increases are symptoms of economic distress requiring structural interventions including
    demand reduction efforts targeted at vulnerable youth populations.
