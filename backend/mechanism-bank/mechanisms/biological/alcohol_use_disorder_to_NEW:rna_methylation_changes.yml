description: Alcohol use disorder affects RNA methylation, an emerging area of epigenetic research. Like
  histone methylation, RNA methylation can have bidirectional effects on gene expression, contributing
  to the complex pathophysiology of AUD.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: RNA methylation represents a newer epigenetic mechanism linking alcohol exposure
    to gene expression changes. Understanding these pathways can inform interventions that address both
    structural determinants of AUD and its biological consequences.
