direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption in individuals with AUD leads to sustained
  elevation of blood pressure (hypertension) and direct cardiotoxic effects on myocardial
  tissue'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol exposure causes alcoholic cardiomyopathy, characterized
  by weakened heart muscle, arrhythmias, and impaired cardiac function'
- 'Step 3: AUD promotes dyslipidemia, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress,
  accelerating atherosclerotic plaque formation in coronary and cerebral arteries'
- 'Step 4: These cumulative cardiovascular insults increase risk of fatal cardiac
  events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, making CVD the
  leading cause of death in the AUD population'

description: Meta-analysis of 31 studies found that cardiovascular disease is the
  most common cause of death among patients treated for alcohol use disorders, with
  a mortality rate of 6.9 per 1000 person-years. This confirms that despite increased
  risk of gastrointestinal and unnatural deaths in AUD patients, CVD remains the leading
  cause of mortality, similar to the general population but with elevated absolute
  rates due to alcohol-related cardiovascular damage.
