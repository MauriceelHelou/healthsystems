direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individual variation in bitter taste receptor sensitivity affects perception of alcohol''s
  bitter notes'
- 'Step 2: Higher bitter taste sensitivity creates aversive orosensory experience with alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 3: Aversive taste experience reduces palatability and preference for alcoholic drinks'
- 'Step 4: Reduced preference may limit quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Lower consumption patterns may protect against binge drinking behaviors'

description: The review suggests that taste sensation mediates alcohol intake, with individuals experiencing
  different orosensation from alcoholic drinks due to genetic variability in taste perception. This mechanism
  proposes that heightened bitter taste sensitivity may serve as a protective factor against excessive
  alcohol consumption by reducing palatability of alcoholic beverages.

  description: Bitter taste sensitivity may have stronger effects on consumption of certain alcoholic
    beverages with more pronounced bitter profiles
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While focusing on biological taste sensitivity, this mechanism intersects with
    structural factors including the alcohol industry's development of sweeter, less bitter alcoholic
    products that may circumvent taste-based protective factors. Understanding this pathway has implications
    for alcohol product regulation and marketing restrictions, particularly for products designed to mask
    bitter notes and appeal to taste-sensitive individuals including youth.
