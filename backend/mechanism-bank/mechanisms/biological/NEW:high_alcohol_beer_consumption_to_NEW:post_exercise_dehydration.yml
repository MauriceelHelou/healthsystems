direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol content beer (>4%) is consumed post-exercise'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exerts diuretic effect by suppressing antidiuretic hormone (ADH)'
- 'Step 3: Increased urinary output leads to greater fluid losses'
- 'Step 4: Particularly pronounced when large volumes (>700ml) are consumed'
- 'Step 5: Inadequate rehydration may impair recovery and subsequent performance'

description: Higher alcohol content beer (>4%) consumed post-exercise increases dehydration risk through
  diuretic effects. The review recommends pairing with nonalcoholic beverages to mitigate fluid losses.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Sports culture and commercial sponsorship by alcohol companies creates structural
    pressure to consume beer post-exercise. This finding has implications for workplace wellness programs,
    sports league policies, and advertising regulations in athletic contexts.
