mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes teratogenic effects on developing brain'
- 'Step 2: Structural abnormalities develop in brain regions affected by alcohol'
- 'Step 3: FASD diagnosis captures individuals with significant prenatal alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 4: However, evidence is insufficient to support clinical MRI findings as diagnostic criteria'

description: While 110 studies examined structural and neurological outcomes, evidence was insufficient
  to support inclusion of structural brain abnormalities (via clinical MRI), seizures, or neurological
  conditions in FASD diagnostic criteria
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights gaps in evidence for certain diagnostic criteria, with
    implications for clinical practice and resource allocation. Structural competency requires understanding
    that diagnostic criteria shape service access and that evidence gaps may reflect research funding
    priorities rather than absence of effects.
