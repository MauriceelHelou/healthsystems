direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during critical periods of fetal development disrupts
  neurological and physical maturation'
- 'Step 2: This teratogenic exposure causes permanent structural and functional brain
  abnormalities'
- 'Step 3: The resulting neurodevelopmental impairments manifest as cognitive, behavioral,
  and adaptive functioning deficits'
- 'Step 4: These deficits constitute developmental disabilities that persist throughout
  the lifespan'
