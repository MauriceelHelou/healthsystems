direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol alters intestinal environment including pH, bile acids, and oxygen levels'
- 'Step 2: Changed environment favors facultative anaerobes like Enterobacteriaceae'
- 'Step 3: Reduced competition from depleted beneficial bacteria allows Enterobacteriaceae expansion'
- 'Step 4: Overgrowth of these gram-negative bacteria increases endotoxin (LPS) production'
- 'Step 5: Higher LPS levels contribute to systemic inflammation and organ damage'

description: Alcohol use disorder consistently produces overgrowth of Enterobacteriaceae family bacteria,
  which are associated with increased endotoxin production and systemic health complications
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This biological mechanism represents one pathway through which structural inequities
    in access to addiction treatment translate into compounded health burdens through inflammatory processes.
