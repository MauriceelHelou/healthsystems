direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic kidney disease results in reduced estimated glomerular filtration
  rate (eGFR), indicating decreased nephron function and kidney filtration capacity'
- 'Step 2: Progressive nephron loss leads to compensatory hyperfiltration in remaining
  nephrons, causing further glomerular damage and accelerating kidney function decline'
- 'Step 3: Concurrent albuminuria reflects glomerular barrier damage and tubular injury,
  which independently contributes to and predicts further kidney deterioration'
- 'Step 4: Continued decline in eGFR through these mechanisms eventually leads to
  kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation) when
  eGFR falls below critical thresholds'

description: This large individual-participant data meta-analysis of 114 global cohorts
  (27.5 million individuals) demonstrates that lower eGFR is significantly associated
  with higher risk of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy. The association
  is present even in mild CKD categories and is strengthened by concurrent albuminuria.
  Both creatinine-based and creatinine-cystatin C-based eGFR measurements show consistent
  associations with adverse kidney outcomes.
