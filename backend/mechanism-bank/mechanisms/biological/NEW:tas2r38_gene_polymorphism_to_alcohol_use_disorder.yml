- 'Step 1: TAS2R38 gene polymorphisms (rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939) alter bitter taste receptor function'
- 'Step 2: Variation in bitter taste perception affects orosensory experience of alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with reduced bitter sensitivity may find alcoholic drinks more palatable'
- 'Step 4: Altered taste preference influences alcohol consumption patterns and frequency'
- 'Step 5: Differential consumption patterns may contribute to development of alcohol use disorder'

description: This systematic review examines how genetic variation in taste receptor genes, particularly
  TAS2R38, may influence alcohol consumption behavior through altered orosensory perception of alcoholic
  beverages. The review found inconclusive findings across 17 studies, indicating the complexity of gene-behavior
  relationships in alcohol consumption.

  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on genetic/biological factors, understanding genetic
    susceptibility to alcohol use can inform public health approaches. Importantly, genetic predisposition
    operates within structural contexts - alcohol availability, marketing, pricing policies, and social
    norms all interact with individual biological susceptibility. This research could support personalized
    prevention approaches while avoiding genetic determinism. Equity implications include the need to
    ensure genetic-based interventions do not stigmatize or discriminate against individuals with certain
    genotypes, and recognition that populations may have different allele frequencies requiring population-specific
    approaches.
