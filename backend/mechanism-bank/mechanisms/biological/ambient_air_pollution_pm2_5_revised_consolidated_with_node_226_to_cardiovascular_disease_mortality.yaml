direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is inhaled and penetrates deep into the
  alveolar regions of the lungs due to its small aerodynamic diameter (<2.5 μm)'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 particles trigger local pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress,
  releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species into systemic circulation'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial dysfunction, accelerating atherosclerotic
  plaque formation and destabilization in coronary and cerebral arteries'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure leads to autonomic nervous system imbalance, increased
  blood pressure, and altered cardiac electrophysiology'
- 'Step 5: These cumulative cardiovascular insults increase risk of ischemic heart
  disease events, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality'

description: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is consistently and significantly associated
  with increased cardiovascular disease mortality across multiple large-scale meta-analyses
  and multinational studies. The pooled evidence from over 900 studies demonstrates
  an 11% excess risk of cardiovascular mortality per 10 μg/m³ increase in PM2.5, with
  particularly strong associations for ischemic heart disease. The biological pathway
  involves systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated
  atherosclerosis. Short-term exposure studies confirm acute effects (0.55-0.68% increase
  per 10 μg/m³), while long-term cohort studies reveal cumulative cardiovascular damage.
  The evidence certainty is rated high by WHO systematic reviews, supporting current
  air quality guidelines.
