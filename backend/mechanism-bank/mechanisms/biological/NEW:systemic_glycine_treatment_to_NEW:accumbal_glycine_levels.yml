direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systemic glycine administration (intraperitoneal) increases circulating glycine levels'
- 'Step 2: Glycine crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters central nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Extracellular glycine levels increase in the nucleus accumbens in a dose-dependent manner'
- 'Step 4: Elevated accumbal glycine acts on glycine receptors (GlyR) in the reward pathway'

description: Systemic glycine treatment increases extracellular glycine levels in the nucleus accumbens
  in a dose-dependent manner, providing a mechanism for modulating the dopamine reward pathway involved
  in alcohol use disorder.

  equity_implications: This mechanism supports pharmacological intervention development for AUD treatment,
    potentially expanding treatment options beyond current medications with modest effect sizes. Equitable
    access to such treatments would require addressing healthcare access disparities.
