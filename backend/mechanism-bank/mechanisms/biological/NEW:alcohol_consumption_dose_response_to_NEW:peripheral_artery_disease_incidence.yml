direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nonlinear dose-response relationship exists between alcohol intake and vascular health outcomes'
- 'Step 2: At low doses (≤2 drinks/week), cardioprotective mechanisms predominate including improved lipid
  profiles'
- 'Step 3: As consumption increases beyond moderate levels, harmful effects emerge including hypertension,
  oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory states'
- 'Step 4: At ≥10 drinks/week, cumulative vascular damage exceeds protective effects, leading to increased
  PAD risk'

description: Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant U-shaped nonlinear association between
  alcohol consumption and PAD risk (P nonlinearity <0.001). Risk nadir occurred at approximately 2 drinks/week
  with pronounced risk elevation at ≥10 drinks/week.

  description: Lowest risk at 2 drinks/week; risk increases pronouncedly at ≥10 drinks/week demonstrating
    clear U-shaped dose-response
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Understanding the dose-response relationship is critical for evidence-based alcohol
    policy. Structural interventions including pricing policies, availability restrictions, and marketing
    regulations can influence population-level consumption patterns. Policies should aim to shift heavy
    drinkers toward moderation rather than encouraging non-drinkers to initiate consumption.
