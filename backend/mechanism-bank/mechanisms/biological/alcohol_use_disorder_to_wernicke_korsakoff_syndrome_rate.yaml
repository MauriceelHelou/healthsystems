direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use disorder impairs thiamine absorption from the gastrointestinal
  tract, reduces thiamine storage in the liver, and increases metabolic demand for
  thiamine'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency reduces the activity of thiamine-dependent enzymes
  (particularly transketolase) in brain regions, with selective vulnerability in mammillary
  bodies, thalamus, and periventricular areas'
- 'Step 3: Thiamine-dependent metabolic dysfunction leads to cellular damage in susceptible
  brain regions, manifesting as acute Wernicke''s encephalopathy that may progress
  to chronic Korsakoff syndrome if untreated'

description: Alcohol use disorder increases the risk of developing Wernicke-Korsakoff
  syndrome through thiamine deficiency-mediated mechanisms. Chronic alcohol consumption
  impairs thiamine metabolism through multiple pathways including reduced absorption,
  decreased storage, and increased metabolic demand. This leads to deficiency of thiamine-dependent
  enzymes, particularly transketolase, in vulnerable brain regions such as mammillary
  bodies, thalamus, and periventricular areas. The resulting metabolic dysfunction
  causes characteristic brain lesions that manifest as acute Wernicke's encephalopathy
  and may progress to chronic Korsakoff syndrome if thiamine replacement is inadequate
  or delayed.
structural_competency_notes: Social determinants such as poor nutrition, limited healthcare
  access, and social isolation in individuals with alcohol use disorder can exacerbate
  thiamine deficiency and delay recognition and treatment of early Wernicke's encephalopathy,
  increasing the likelihood of progression to Korsakoff syndrome.
