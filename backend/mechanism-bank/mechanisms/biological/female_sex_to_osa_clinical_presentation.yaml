direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sex-based differences exist in upper airway anatomy and pharyngeal collapsibility'
- 'Step 2: Hormonal influences (estrogen, progesterone) affect respiratory control
  and airway mechanics'
- 'Step 3: Different fat distribution patterns influence airway patency'
- 'Step 4: These biological differences lead to distinct clinical manifestations of
  OSA in women'
