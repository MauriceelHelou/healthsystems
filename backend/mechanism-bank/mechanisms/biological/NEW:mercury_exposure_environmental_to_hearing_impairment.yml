  node_name: Environmental Mercury (Hg) Exposure
to_node:
  node_id: hearing_impairment
  node_name: Hearing Impairment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mercury enters the environment through industrial emissions, coal combustion, and waste disposal'
- 'Step 2: Methylmercury bioaccumulates in fish and seafood, entering the human food chain'
- 'Step 3: Mercury crosses biological barriers and accumulates in neural tissues including auditory pathways'
- 'Step 4: Neurotoxic effects damage the cochlea, auditory nerve, and central auditory processing centers'
- 'Step 5: Auditory function is impaired leading to hearing loss'

description: Environmental mercury pollution is associated with hearing loss through neurotoxic mechanisms
  affecting the auditory system. The meta-analysis synthesizes evidence on mercury exposure and hearing
  outcomes in population-based studies.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Mercury exposure varies by proximity to industrial emissions, reliance on fish as dietary
    staple, and occupational settings (dental, mining)

  description: Populations relying heavily on fish consumption may have higher methylmercury exposure

  description: Organic mercury (methylmercury) is more neurotoxic than inorganic forms
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Mercury exposure reflects structural inequities in environmental regulation, industrial
    policy, and food system contamination. Indigenous and coastal communities with traditional fish-based
    diets bear disproportionate methylmercury burden. Industrial emissions from coal plants and waste
    facilities are often concentrated near marginalized communities. This mechanism links hearing loss
    to failures in environmental protection and equitable industrial siting.
