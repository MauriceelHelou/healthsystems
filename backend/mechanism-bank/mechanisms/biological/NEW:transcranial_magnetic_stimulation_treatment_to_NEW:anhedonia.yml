description: Active iTBS produced greater reductions in anhedonia (Cohen's d = -0.59) compared to sham
  treatment (d = -0.25). Anhedonia is identified as a strong predictor of relapse among veterans with
  AUD.

  equity_implications: Anhedonia is a transdiagnostic symptom affecting both depression and substance
    use disorders. Veterans may experience elevated anhedonia due to trauma exposure and service-related
    mental health conditions. Effective treatments for anhedonia could address multiple comorbid conditions
    common in veteran populations.
