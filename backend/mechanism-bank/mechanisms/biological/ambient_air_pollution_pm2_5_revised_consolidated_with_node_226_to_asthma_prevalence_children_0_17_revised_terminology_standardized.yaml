    Illness)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children inhale ambient PM2.5 particles, which due to their small size
  (≤2.5 μm) penetrate deep into the lower respiratory tract and alveoli'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 particles trigger local inflammatory responses in airway epithelium,
  causing oxidative stress and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines'
- 'Step 3: Chronic or repeated exposure leads to airway inflammation, increased mucus
  production, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness'
- 'Step 4: These pathophysiological changes manifest as respiratory symptoms including
  wheezing, persistent cough, and lower respiratory illness in children'

description: This meta-analysis of 35 cohort studies demonstrates that ambient PM2.5
  exposure is significantly associated with increased risk of respiratory tract diseases
  in children, including wheezing, cough, and lower respiratory illness. Children
  exposed to PM2.5 show pooled relative risks of 1.082 for wheezing, 1.075 for cough,
  and 1.153 for lower respiratory illness. The association follows a dose-response
  pattern with higher risks at PM2.5 concentrations ≥25 μg/m³.
