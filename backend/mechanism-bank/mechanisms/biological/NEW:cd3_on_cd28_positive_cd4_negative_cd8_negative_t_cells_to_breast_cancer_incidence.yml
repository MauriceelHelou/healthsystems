description: Mendelian randomization analysis demonstrates that genetically predicted higher levels of
  CD3 expression on CD28+ CD4-CD8- T cells are causally protective against breast cancer. This immune
  phenotype reduces breast cancer risk through enhanced immune surveillance, direct cytokine-mediated
  tumor suppression, induction of tumor cell apoptosis, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment.

  variation_notes: Study notes breast cancer has highest incidence in North America, Europe, and Australia,
    with lower rates in parts of Asia and Africa. The 5-year survival rate is over 90% in developed countries
    but lower in developing ones.

  description: Early screening and diagnosis capacity in developed countries may interact with immune
    protection mechanisms to improve outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism is primarily biological, the paper acknowledges that breast
    cancer risk and outcomes are influenced by structural factors including access to early screening
    (mammography, MRI), healthcare system development, and geographic location. The protective immune
    mechanism may be less effective in populations with limited access to healthcare or in environments
    with higher exposure to risk factors like obesity and alcohol consumption, which the paper identifies
    as modifiable risk factors influenced by structural conditions.
