- 'Step 1: HIV infection leads to progressive immune system dysfunction through CD4+
  T-cell depletion and chronic immune activation'
- 'Step 2: Immunocompromised state increases vulnerability to opportunistic infections,
  malignancies, and other AIDS-defining conditions'
- 'Step 3: HIV-related comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, liver disease, renal
  dysfunction) accelerate due to chronic inflammation and antiretroviral medication
  effects'
- 'Step 4: Among people with opioid use disorder, HIV compounds mortality risk through
  synergistic effects of immune suppression and drug-related health complications'
- 'Step 5: Elevated all-cause mortality results from combination of AIDS-related deaths,
  non-AIDS comorbidities, and increased susceptibility to overdose complications'

description: HIV status is identified as a substantial predictor of all-cause mortality
  among people with opioid use disorder. This meta-analysis of 101 cohorts found that
  individuals with HIV had substantially higher all-cause mortality rates. The mechanism
  operates through HIV's immunosuppressive effects combined with the health vulnerabilities
  associated with substance use, creating compounded mortality risk. HIV is identified
  as a potentially modifiable risk factor amenable to global efforts improving treatment
  access and harm reduction.
