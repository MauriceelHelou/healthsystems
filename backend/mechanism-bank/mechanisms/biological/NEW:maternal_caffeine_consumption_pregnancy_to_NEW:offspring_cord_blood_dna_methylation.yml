direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant women consume caffeine through coffee, tea, or cola beverages'
- 'Step 2: Caffeine crosses the placental barrier and exposes the developing fetus'
- 'Step 3: Fetal exposure to caffeine may trigger epigenetic changes in cord blood cells'
- 'Step 4: DNA methylation patterns are altered at specific CpG sites in offspring cord blood'
- 'Step 5: These epigenetic modifications may serve as a biological bridge between environmental exposure
  and gene expression'

description: This meta-analysis of 3725 European mother-child pairs examined whether maternal caffeine
  consumption during pregnancy affects offspring DNA methylation at birth. The study found only two significant
  changes in DNA methylation - one associated with total caffeine and one with cola consumption - which
  the authors interpret as insufficient evidence that caffeine intake during pregnancy substantially impacts
  offspring epigenetic programming. The biological plausibility is supported by comparisons to smoking
  during pregnancy, which produces thousands of DNAm changes, suggesting caffeine's effects, if present,
  are much smaller in magnitude.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This study examines a behavioral exposure (caffeine consumption) that is shaped
    by structural factors including food environment access, workplace culture, marketing of caffeinated
    beverages, and socioeconomic status affecting beverage choices. The finding of minimal effects at
    low-moderate consumption levels has policy implications for pregnancy guidelines that currently recommend
    limiting caffeine to <200mg daily. From an equity perspective, caffeine consumption patterns vary
    by socioeconomic status and cultural context across European populations studied. The study avoids
    individual blame by noting structural uncertainty about whether current guidelines are justified by
    biological evidence.
