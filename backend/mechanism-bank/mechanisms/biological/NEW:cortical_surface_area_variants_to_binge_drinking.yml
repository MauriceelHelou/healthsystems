description: Genetic correlations with neuroimaging phenotypes revealed that variants associated with
  increased cortical surface area overlap with those influencing both sensation seeking and alcohol consumption.
  This multi-omic evidence links brain structural variation to alcohol-related phenotypes at the genetic
  level.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The identification of brain structural correlates provides objective biological
    markers associated with alcohol consumption risk. This evidence base can inform targeted prevention
    strategies and supports understanding alcohol problems as having neurobiological underpinnings beyond
    individual choice.
