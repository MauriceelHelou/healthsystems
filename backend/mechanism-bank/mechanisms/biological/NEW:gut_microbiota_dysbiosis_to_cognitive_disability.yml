description: Gut microbiota dysbiosis from alcohol use disorder disrupts the gut-brain axis, leading to
  dysfunction in limbic brain circuits that manifests as cognitive impairment including learning and memory
  deficits.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights that cognitive dysfunction in AUD is mediated by biological
    pathways involving gut-brain communication, suggesting therapeutic targets beyond behavioral intervention
    alone.
