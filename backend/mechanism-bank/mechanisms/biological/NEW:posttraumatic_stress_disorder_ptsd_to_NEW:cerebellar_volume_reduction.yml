direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traumatic stress exposure leads to PTSD development'
- 'Step 2: Chronic hyperarousal and fear conditioning affect cerebellar circuits'
- 'Step 3: Sustained stress-related neurobiological processes cause gray matter volume loss in cerebellum'
- 'Step 4: Cerebellar changes may contribute to emotional dysregulation and motor/cognitive symptoms'

description: The most significant effect in the meta-analysis was found in the left cerebellum, with PTSD
  patients showing smaller gray matter volumes. This finding adds to growing literature implicating the
  cerebellum in PTSD psychopathology beyond traditional focus on amygdala and hippocampus.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cerebellar involvement in PTSD represents neurobiological consequences of trauma
    exposure. Structural factors including poverty, discrimination, community violence, and inadequate
    mental health services create differential trauma exposure and treatment access. These brain changes
    demonstrate how social conditions become biologically embedded.
