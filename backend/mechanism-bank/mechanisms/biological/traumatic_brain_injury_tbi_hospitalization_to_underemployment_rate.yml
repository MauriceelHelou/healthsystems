direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate to severe TBI causes lasting cognitive and functional impairments'
- 'Step 2: Survivors may be unable to return to their pre-injury occupation or level of responsibility'
- 'Step 3: Return to work often requires accepting lower-level positions or reduced hours'
- 'Step 4: Only 33% return to pre-injury level of work despite 42% being employed'
- 'Step 5: Gap between employment rate and return-to-previous-work rate reflects widespread underemployment'

description: While 42.2% of msTBI survivors achieve post-injury employment, only 33.0% return to their
  pre-injury level of work. This 9-percentage-point gap indicates substantial underemployment among TBI
  survivors who do return to work.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The disparity between any employment and quality employment reflects structural
    barriers including lack of vocational rehabilitation services, inadequate workplace accommodations,
    absence of graduated return-to-work programs, and employer discrimination against workers with disabilities.
    Policies supporting workplace accommodations and vocational rehabilitation could narrow this gap.
