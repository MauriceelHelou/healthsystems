direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community violence exposure triggers acute and chronic sympathetic nervous system activation'
- 'Step 2: Repeated fight-or-flight responses lead to altered epinephrine and norepinephrine regulation'
- 'Step 3: Catecholamine dysregulation affects cardiovascular function, blood pressure, and metabolic
  processes'
- 'Step 4: Chronic elevation contributes to hypertension, cardiac disease risk, and immune dysfunction'

description: Community violence exposure affects sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) system function,
  altering epinephrine and norepinephrine levels as primary mediators of the stress response and allostatic
  load accumulation.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Catecholamine effects likely vary by intensity and chronicity of violence exposure,
    which differs by geographic location and neighborhood context
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This biological pathway illustrates how structural violence and neighborhood conditions
    become embodied through autonomic nervous system dysregulation. The concentration of violence in marginalized
    communities means these physiological costs are inequitably distributed along lines of race and class.
