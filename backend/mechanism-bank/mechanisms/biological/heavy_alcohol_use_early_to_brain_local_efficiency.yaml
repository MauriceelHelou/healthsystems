direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during critical periods of brain development disrupts
  local circuit formation and refinement'
- 'Step 2: Neurotoxic effects reduce structural covariance between neighboring brain
  regions'
- 'Step 3: Decreased local covariance reduces the efficiency of information processing
  within local brain circuits'
- 'Step 4: Lower local efficiency indicates compromised fault tolerance and local
  network resilience'
