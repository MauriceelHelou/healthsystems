- 'Step 1: Vitamin D supplementation targets vitamin D receptor pathways'

  cardiac muscle'
- 'Step 3: Despite biological plausibility, supplementation did not demonstrate statistically significant
  cardiovascular mortality reduction'

description: Meta-analysis found vitamin D supplementation was not statistically associated with lower
  risk of cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular morbidity outcomes including myocardial infarction,
  stroke, heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events. This null finding persisted across study
  quality strata.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of cardiovascular benefit from supplementation suggests that cardiovascular
    disease mortality is more strongly determined by upstream structural factors (food environment, built
    environment promoting physical activity, healthcare access for hypertension/diabetes management, occupational
    stress) rather than isolated nutrient supplementation. Addressing cardiovascular health inequities
    requires structural interventions beyond individual supplementation.
