- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol overuse disrupts the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis (HPT) axis'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol''s toxic effects on Leydig cells in the testes impair testosterone synthesis'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted feedback mechanisms alter LH secretion patterns'
- 'Step 4: Resultant testosterone deficiency affects male reproductive and metabolic health'

description: Chronic alcohol overuse, particularly in those with alcohol use disorder, disrupts the hypothalamus-pituitary-testis
  axis leading to alterations in testosterone levels. The meta-analysis found significant changes in testosterone
  in individuals with alcohol use disorder with associated feedback changes in LH.

  description: Individuals with alcohol use disorder show notable alterations in testosterone levels compared
    to moderate/low consumers; effect is dose-dependent with overuse showing destructive effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to structural determinants through alcohol availability,
    marketing, and socioeconomic factors that influence alcohol use patterns. Communities with greater
    alcohol outlet density and fewer economic opportunities may have higher rates of alcohol use disorder.
    The biological pathway demonstrates how structural factors enabling excessive alcohol consumption
    translate to hormonal disruption.
