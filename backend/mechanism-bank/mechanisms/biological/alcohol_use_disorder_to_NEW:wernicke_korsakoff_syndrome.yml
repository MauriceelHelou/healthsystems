mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use leads to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency causes Wernicke encephalopathy (acute phase)'
- 'Step 3: Without treatment, progression to Korsakoff syndrome occurs'
- 'Step 4: Permanent cognitive and memory impairments develop (alcohol-related dementia subtype)'

description: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome represents a specific alcohol-related dementia pathway explicitly
  studied in this review. It results from thiamine deficiency associated with chronic alcoholism, representing
  a distinct pathological entity from Alzheimer's disease.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is a preventable condition through adequate nutrition
    support and alcohol treatment access. Structural interventions including fortification policies, nutritional
    support programs for vulnerable populations, and accessible AUD treatment could prevent this outcome.
