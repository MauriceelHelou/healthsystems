direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic kidney disease leads to progressive decline in renal function,
  resulting in accumulation of uremic toxins, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid retention'
- 'Step 2: These metabolic derangements cause systemic inflammation, oxidative stress,
  accelerated atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular complications'
- 'Step 3: CKD-associated comorbidities including anemia, mineral bone disorder, and
  immune dysfunction further compromise physiological resilience'
- 'Step 4: In patients with comorbid conditions (e.g., COPD), CKD impairs compensatory
  mechanisms and reduces physiological reserve during acute exacerbations'
- 'Step 5: The cumulative burden of organ dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and
  impaired recovery capacity leads to significantly increased all-cause mortality
  risk'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 12 studies examining mortality outcomes demonstrates
  that chronic kidney disease significantly increases all-cause mortality risk. CKD
  increased long-term all-cause mortality by 70% (OR 1.70, 95% CI: 1.35-2.15) and
  short-term mortality during acute exacerbations by 53% (OR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.44-1.63).
  The mechanism involves accumulation of uremic toxins, systemic inflammation, cardiovascular
  complications, and reduced physiological reserve that impairs recovery from acute
  health events.'
