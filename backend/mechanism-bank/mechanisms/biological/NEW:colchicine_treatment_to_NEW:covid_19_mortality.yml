  equity_implications: COVID-19 mortality has shown significant disparities by race, socioeconomic status,
    and geography. Access to evidence-based treatments like colchicine may be influenced by healthcare
    infrastructure, insurance status, and proximity to well-resourced medical facilities. Structural inequities
    in healthcare access could lead to differential mortality benefits from this treatment.
