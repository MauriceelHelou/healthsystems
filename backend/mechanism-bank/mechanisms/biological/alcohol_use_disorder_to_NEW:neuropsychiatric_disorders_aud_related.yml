category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persistent or intermittent alcohol cravings and compulsive drinking alter CNS function'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced changes in gut microbiota develop'
- 'Step 3: Gut-microbe-brain axis signaling becomes dysregulated'
- 'Step 4: Hippocampus-amygdala-frontal cortex circuit dysfunction develops'
- 'Step 5: Cognitive impairment and mood disorders manifest clinically'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to neuropsychiatric disorders including cognitive impairment,
  anxiety, and depression through functional CNS changes and gut-brain axis disruption.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism positions neuropsychiatric complications of AUD within a biological
    framework, supporting treatment approaches that target the gut-brain axis rather than focusing solely
    on individual willpower or behavior modification.
