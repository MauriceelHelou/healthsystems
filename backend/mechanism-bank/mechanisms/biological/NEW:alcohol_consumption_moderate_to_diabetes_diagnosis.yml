- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption in overweight/obese women (BMI ≥25)'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol may modulate adipose tissue inflammation and adipokine secretion in individuals with
  excess weight'
- 'Step 3: Improved metabolic profile through effects on lipid metabolism and insulin signaling'
- 'Step 4: Reduced progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes'

description: When results were stratified by BMI, the protective association between moderate alcohol
  consumption and T2DM was only found in overweight and obese women. This suggests the metabolic context
  (excess adiposity) is necessary for the protective mechanism to operate.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding has important equity implications. Obesity prevalence varies significantly
    by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and geography due to structural factors including food environment,
    built environment, and economic constraints. The interaction between alcohol and BMI on diabetes risk
    means that the potential protective effects would theoretically be more relevant in communities with
    higher obesity prevalence, which often face greater structural barriers to health. However, promoting
    alcohol for diabetes prevention would be inappropriate given alcohol's many harms, particularly in
    communities already facing disproportionate alcohol-related harm due to targeted marketing and outlet
    density.
