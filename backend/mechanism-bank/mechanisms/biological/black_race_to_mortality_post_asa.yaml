mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Among patients who successfully receive alcohol septal ablation, clinical
  outcomes are equivalent across racial groups'
- 'Step 2: This demonstrates that when structural barriers to access are overcome,
  biological response to treatment does not differ by race'
- 'Step 3: The lack of mortality difference suggests that racial disparities in HCM
  outcomes are driven by access inequities rather than inherent biological differences'
