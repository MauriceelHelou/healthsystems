mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Serious mental illness (SMI) and problematic alcohol use share overlapping
  genetic architecture, with significant genetic correlations identified between psychiatric
  traits and alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Shared genetic variants affect common neurobiological pathways, including
  dopaminergic reward circuits and stress response systems that are dysregulated in
  both SMI and alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 3: Genetic heritability is enriched in brain regions and regulatory genomic
  regions, suggesting shared neural substrates underlying both conditions'
- 'Step 4: Mendelian randomization analyses indicate causal effects of psychiatric
  status on liability to problematic alcohol use, supporting a biological pathway
  from SMI to AUD'

description: This genome-wide meta-analysis combining data from the Million Veteran
  Program, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and UK Biobank identified significant
  genetic correlations between problematic alcohol use and psychiatric traits. The
  study found 29 independent risk variants for problematic alcohol use, with genetic
  heritability enriched in brain tissue and regulatory genomic regions. Mendelian
  randomization analyses provided evidence for causal effects of psychiatric status
  on liability to problematic alcohol use, supporting a biological mechanism whereby
  shared genetic factors and overlapping neurobiological pathways predispose individuals
  with serious mental illness to develop alcohol use disorder.
