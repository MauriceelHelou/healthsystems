- 'Step 1: Sepsis serves as a major underlying risk factor for ARDS development in critically ill patients'
- 'Step 2: Septic patients develop systemic inflammation that damages pulmonary endothelium and alveolar
  epithelium'
- 'Step 3: ARDS develops as a complication, compounding the severity of sepsis'
- 'Step 4: Combined sepsis and ARDS creates synergistic multi-organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 5: ARDS adds attributable mortality of 15% beyond that from sepsis alone'

description: In septic patients, the development of ARDS as a complication adds 15% to the mortality rate
  beyond what is attributable to sepsis itself. This finding, derived from causal inference methods controlling
  for confounders, provides strong evidence that ARDS prevention in septic patients could meaningfully
  improve survival.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Sepsis disproportionately affects populations with less access to healthcare, those
    with chronic conditions that are poorly managed due to healthcare access barriers, and those living
    in conditions that increase infection risk. Structural factors such as housing quality, healthcare
    access, food security, and economic stability influence both sepsis risk and outcomes. ARDS prevention
    research funding decisions have equity implications for these populations.
