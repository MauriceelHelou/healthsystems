description: The pooled prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Sub-Saharan Africa is 20.83%,
  indicating that approximately one in five pregnant women consume alcohol, placing their fetuses at risk
  for adverse developmental outcomes.

  equity_implications: The high prevalence of prenatal alcohol exposure in Sub-Saharan Africa reflects
    structural determinants including limited health education, inadequate prenatal care infrastructure,
    poverty, mental health service gaps, and reproductive healthcare limitations. Addressing this public
    health concern requires systematic interventions addressing these root causes rather than stigmatizing
    individual pregnant women.
