direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of AUD creates genetic vulnerability through inherited polymorphisms
  in dopaminergic reward pathways (particularly DRD2 gene variants) and altered stress-response
  systems'
- 'Step 2: These genetic predispositions manifest as heightened reward sensitivity,
  altered stress reactivity patterns, and enhanced sweet liking behaviors that increase
  susceptibility to alcohol''s rewarding effects'
- 'Step 3: The combination of genetic risk factors and altered neurobiological responses
  to reward and stress leads to increased likelihood of developing alcohol use disorder,
  with evidence showing stronger treatment responses to targeted interventions in
  family history positive individuals'

description: Family history of alcohol use disorder increases risk for developing
  AUD through inherited genetic vulnerabilities, particularly in dopaminergic reward
  pathways and stress-response systems. The DRD2 gene polymorphisms represent a key
  mechanism, with GWAS studies confirming associations between specific variants and
  increased AUD risk. Individuals with positive family history demonstrate heightened
  reward sensitivity and altered stress reactivity, creating neurobiological conditions
  that favor alcohol's reinforcing effects. This genetic predisposition is evidenced
  by the differential treatment response to naltrexone, which shows greater efficacy
  in family history positive patients, likely due to its ability to modulate the heightened
  reward sensitivity characteristic of this population.
structural_competency_notes: Family history represents both genetic transmission and
  environmental exposure to alcohol use patterns within family systems. The mechanism
  operates through inherited biological vulnerabilities but may be modified by family
  dynamics, socioeconomic factors affecting access to treatment, and cultural norms
  around alcohol use that vary by community and social position.
