direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy drinking occasions (binge drinking) lead to acute physiological stress
  on the cardiovascular system, including blood pressure spikes and cardiac arrhythmias'
- 'Step 2: Repeated binge drinking episodes cause cumulative damage through oxidative
  stress, inflammation, and lipid metabolism disruption'
- 'Step 3: These biological insults promote atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathy, and increased
  thrombotic risk'
- 'Step 4: Progressive cardiovascular damage increases vulnerability to acute cardiac
  events including myocardial infarction and stroke'
- 'Step 5: Elevated risk of fatal cardiovascular events, particularly in those with
  underlying cardiovascular disease'

description: This systematic review of 255 reviews and meta-analyses establishes that
  alcohol use, particularly patterns involving heavy drinking occasions (binge drinking),
  is causally linked to cardiovascular disease mortality. While most partially attributable
  disease categories show monotonic dose-response relationships (more alcohol = higher
  risk), ischaemic heart disease shows a more complex curvilinear relationship where
  potential cardioprotective effects of light-moderate drinking are eliminated by
  irregular heavy drinking occasions. Biological pathways suggest that heavy drinking
  occasions impose acute cardiovascular stress through mechanisms including hypertension,
  arrhythmias, and prothrombotic states, with cumulative damage leading to increased
  mortality risk.
