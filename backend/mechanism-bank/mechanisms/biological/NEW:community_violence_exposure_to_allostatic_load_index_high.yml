direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community violence exposure creates chronic psychological stress in affected populations'
- 'Step 2: Activation of primary stress mediators including cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
  DHEA'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged activation leads to dysregulation across multiple physiological systems (neuroendocrine,
  cardiovascular, metabolic, immune)'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative physiological wear and tear manifests as elevated allostatic load scores'
- 'Step 5: High allostatic load increases risk for chronic diseases and premature mortality'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis examines how community violence exposure affects
  the four primary mediators of allostatic load (cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, DHEA), demonstrating
  that violence operates as a chronic stressor that leads to multi-system physiological dysregulation
  and increased disease risk.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Community violence is geographically concentrated in historically disinvested neighborhoods,
    creating spatially patterned health disparities in allostatic load

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The allostatic load framework explicitly connects social and environmental conditions
    to biological embedding of adversity. Community violence is not randomly distributed but concentrated
    in areas affected by historical redlining, disinvestment, and structural racism. This mechanism explains
    how place-based inequities become embodied as biological risk, contributing to racial and socioeconomic
    health disparities without blaming individuals.
