- 'Step 1: Higher HLA DR expression on CD33- HLA DR+ cells enhances antigen presentation capacity'

- 'Step 3: Activated immune cells recognize and target breast cancer cells more effectively'
- 'Step 4: Inhibition of angiogenesis reduces tumor nutrient supply'

description: Mendelian randomization meta-analysis demonstrates that genetically determined higher HLA
  DR expression on CD33- HLA DR+ cells is causally protective against breast cancer. This immune phenotype
  enhances antigen presentation, activates broader antitumor immune responses, and inhibits tumor angiogenesis,
  collectively reducing breast cancer risk.

  description: Lack of physical activity is a risk factor; conversely, physical activity may enhance immune
    protection
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The paper contextualizes immune protection within broader structural determinants.
    Risk factors for breast cancer include modifiable factors (obesity, alcohol consumption, lack of physical
    activity) that are shaped by built environment, food systems, and socioeconomic conditions. The paper
    also notes that survival rates differ dramatically between developed and developing countries (>90%
    vs. lower), highlighting how healthcare infrastructure and access to screening technologies (mammography,
    MRI) create structural inequities in cancer outcomes. These structural factors may influence whether
    immune-mediated protection translates to reduced mortality.
