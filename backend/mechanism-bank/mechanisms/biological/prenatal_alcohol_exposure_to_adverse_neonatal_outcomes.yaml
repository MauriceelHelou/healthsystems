direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption results in fetal exposure to ethanol during
  critical periods of organ and system development'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure disrupts multiple biological processes including cell
  proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis across developing organ systems'
- 'Step 3: These disruptions affect placental function, fetal growth trajectories,
  and organ maturation'
- 'Step 4: Biological disruptions manifest as range of adverse outcomes including
  preterm birth, low birth weight, growth restriction, and developmental abnormalities'
