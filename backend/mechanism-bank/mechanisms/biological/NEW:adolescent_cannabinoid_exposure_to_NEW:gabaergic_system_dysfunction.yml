description: Adolescent cannabinoid exposure leads to enrichment of differentially expressed proteins
  related to the GABAergic neurotransmitter system in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting disruption of
  inhibitory neurotransmission as a mechanism underlying negative outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The GABAergic system findings provide a biological mechanism linking structural
    factors (cannabis availability, policy environment, community prevention resources) to mental health
    outcomes. Communities with greater cannabis availability or fewer prevention resources may see differential
    adolescent exposure, creating health inequities through this neurobiological pathway. This underscores
    the importance of structural interventions rather than individual-level blame.
