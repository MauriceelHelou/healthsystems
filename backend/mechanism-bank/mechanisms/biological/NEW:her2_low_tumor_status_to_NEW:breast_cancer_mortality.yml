description: HER2-low tumor status is associated with a 22% higher risk of death compared to HER2-zero
  tumors in patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors, although this
  analysis was limited by short follow-up duration.

  description: Short median follow-up may underestimate the true mortality difference; longer follow-up

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The identification of HER2-low as a prognostic biomarker has implications for healthcare
    system organization and equity. Ensuring universal access to appropriate HER2 testing methodology
    and novel targeted therapies for HER2-low disease is essential. Structural barriers to specialized
    oncology care, biomarker testing, and newer therapeutics may disproportionately affect marginalized
    populations.
