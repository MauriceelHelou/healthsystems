mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: In non-smoking cohorts, low-volume alcohol consumption shows mean RR above 1.0 (RR=1.16, 0.91-1.41)'
- 'Step 2: This suggests alcohol consumption, even at low volumes, may increase mortality risk when smoking
  confounding is removed'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol''s toxic and carcinogenic properties may explain increased mortality without smoking
  as competing risk'
- 'Step 4: Previous apparent protective associations were confounded by unmeasured health behaviors and
  selection effects'

description: Exploratory analyses in non-smoking cohorts suggest that even low-volume alcohol consumption
  may increase mortality risk (RR=1.16), though confidence intervals include 1.0. This finding challenges
  the widely held belief in alcohol's protective effects and suggests the relationship between alcohol
  and health may be mediated, moderated, or confounded by smoking status.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Public health guidelines on 'safe' alcohol consumption have structural implications
    for population health. If low-volume drinking is not protective and may be harmful, current policies
    that implicitly endorse moderate drinking may contribute to population-level harm. This particularly
    affects populations targeted by alcohol marketing and those with less access to accurate health information.
