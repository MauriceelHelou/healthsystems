mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neurocognitive trajectories during adolescence establish patterns across
  RDoC domains (negative valence, positive valence, cognitive systems, social processes,
  arousal/regulatory systems)'
- 'Step 2: These trajectories represent risk factors that precede substance use initiation
  and escalation during critical neurodevelopmental windows'
- 'Step 3: Aberrant neurocognitive development creates vulnerabilities in reward processing,
  executive function, and emotion regulation systems'
- 'Step 4: These neurobiological vulnerabilities increase susceptibility to developing
  substance use disorders when exposed to drugs/alcohol'
