  node_name: Substance Use Disorder (Any)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The SLC6A3 gene encodes the dopamine transporter, which regulates dopamine reuptake in neural
  synapses'
- 'Step 2: Polymorphisms in this gene (rs28363170 40-bp VNTR) may alter transporter expression and dopamine
  availability'
- 'Step 3: Dopaminergic pathways are central to reward processing and addiction vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Altered dopamine signaling may influence susceptibility to prolonged substance use patterns'
- 'Step 5: However, this meta-analysis found NO statistically significant association under any inheritance
  mode'

description: This meta-analysis of 29 studies (5221 cases, 4822 controls) found NO statistically significant
  association between SLC6A3 rs28363170 polymorphism and substance abuse disorders under any inheritance
  model. This null finding is important as it contradicts some prior studies and suggests that this particular
  genetic variant does not independently confer risk for substance use disorders, highlighting the complex,
  multifactorial nature of addiction.

  description: No statistically significant correlation was observed under any mode of inheritance (dominant,
    recessive, co-dominant)

  equity_implications: This null genetic finding underscores that substance use disorders cannot be reduced
    to simple genetic determinism. Structural factors - including economic deprivation, trauma exposure,
    neighborhood drug availability, lack of treatment access, and policies around drug criminalization
    - likely play more significant roles in substance use disorder development than this genetic variant.
    The societal burden of substance abuse disorders mentioned in the abstract reflects structural conditions
    rather than individual genetic failings. Treatment approaches must address social determinants rather
    than focusing solely on biological predisposition.
