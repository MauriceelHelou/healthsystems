mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic substance use alters neurotransmitter systems including dopamine,
  serotonin, and GABA'
- 'Step 2: Neurobiological changes lead to dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Brain chemistry alterations manifest as depression, anxiety, and other
  mental health conditions'
