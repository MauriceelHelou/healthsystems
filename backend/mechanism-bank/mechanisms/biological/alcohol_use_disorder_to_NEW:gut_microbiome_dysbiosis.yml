direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption directly exposes gut epithelium to ethanol and its metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol alters the diversity of gut bacteria populations'
- 'Step 3: Bacterial overgrowth occurs with shifts in microbial community composition'
- 'Step 4: Dysbiosis disrupts gut barrier function and microbial metabolite production'

description: Chronic alcohol consumption directly alters the gut microbiota by reducing bacterial diversity
  and causing bacterial overgrowth, leading to dysbiosis that affects the gut-liver-brain axis.

  description: Chronic rather than acute alcohol use leads to more pronounced microbiome alterations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism operates at the biological level, upstream structural factors
    including lack of provider knowledge about AUD pharmacotherapy, low utilization of evidence-based
    treatments, and healthcare system barriers contribute to inadequate treatment of AUD, allowing chronic
    exposure to continue.
