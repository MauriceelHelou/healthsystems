direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use leads to alcohol-related liver disease'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure affects multiple organ systems beyond the liver simultaneously'
- 'Step 3: Neurological damage (peripheral neuropathy, cognitive impairment)'
- 'Step 4: Gastrointestinal complications (pancreatitis, gastritis)'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative extra-hepatic organ damage increases overall morbidity burden'

description: This systematic review demonstrates that patients with alcohol-related liver disease face
  significant morbidity from conditions beyond the liver, including neurological, cardiovascular, and
  gastrointestinal complications, due to the systemic toxic effects of chronic alcohol exposure.

  equity_implications: 'Extra-hepatic morbidity in ALD represents a cascade of harm originating from structural
    factors: alcohol industry marketing, inadequate regulation of alcohol pricing/availability, limited
    addiction treatment infrastructure, and healthcare systems that fail to integrate liver and addiction
    care. These burdens fall disproportionately on socioeconomically disadvantaged populations with higher
    alcohol outlet density in their neighborhoods and fewer treatment resources.'
