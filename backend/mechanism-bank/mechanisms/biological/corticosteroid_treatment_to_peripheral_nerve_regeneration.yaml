direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Corticosteroids exert anti-inflammatory effects that reduce tissue damage
  and inflammation at the site of peripheral nerve injury'
- 'Step 2: Corticosteroids regulate neuronal protein production which is essential
  for nerve repair processes'
- 'Step 3: Corticosteroids facilitate myelination processes that support nerve fiber
  regeneration and functional recovery'
