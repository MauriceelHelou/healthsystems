direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use leads to hepatic injury through acetaldehyde toxicity
  and free radical formation, causing progressive liver damage'
- 'Step 2: Continued alcohol-induced liver injury progresses to cirrhosis, resulting
  in portal hypertension and development of esophageal varices as collateral circulation'
- 'Step 3: Portal hypertension increases pressure in esophageal varices, combined
  with alcohol-related coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction, leading to variceal
  bleeding'

description: Alcohol use disorder causes esophageal varices bleeding through a multi-step
  process involving alcohol-induced liver injury, progression to cirrhosis with portal
  hypertension, development of esophageal varices, and subsequent bleeding due to
  increased portal pressure and alcohol-related coagulopathy. Heavy alcohol use significantly
  increases the risk of hepatic decompensation including variceal bleeding, independent
  of other factors like hepatitis C infection.
structural_competency_notes: Alcohol use disorder disproportionately affects individuals
  with lower socioeconomic status, limited healthcare access, and social marginalization.
  Structural barriers to alcohol treatment and hepatology care may delay intervention,
  allowing progression to advanced liver disease and variceal bleeding. Healthcare
  provider knowledge gaps about alcohol pharmacotherapy represent additional structural
  barriers to preventing this pathway.
