- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis increases intestinal permeability (leaky gut)'
- 'Step 2: Bacterial products and endotoxins translocate from gut to portal circulation'
- 'Step 3: Liver exposed to increased microbial-derived inflammatory signals'
- 'Step 4: Hepatic inflammation and fibrosis progress to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)'
- 'Step 5: Progressive liver damage leads to cirrhosis and increased mortality'

description: Gut microbiome dysbiosis from chronic alcohol use contributes to progression of alcohol-associated
  liver disease through gut-liver axis dysfunction, with studies showing FMT may alleviate some symptoms.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Chronic alcohol use leading to liver disease reflects structural barriers in accessing
    AUD treatment. The abstract explicitly notes low utilization of pharmacotherapy due to lack of provider
    knowledge and comfort prescribing AUD medications, representing healthcare system failures.
