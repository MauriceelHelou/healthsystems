mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Female-specific hormonal factors influence alcohol metabolism and liver response'
- 'Step 2: Estrogen may potentiate alcohol-induced oxidative stress and inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Lower gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity in females leads to higher systemic alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced fibrogenic response to equivalent hepatotoxic insult'
- 'Step 5: More rapid cirrhosis development and increased hospitalization risk'

description: At high alcohol consumption levels (80g/day), females demonstrate dramatically elevated cirrhosis
  risk with RR of 23.32, nearly three times higher than the male RR of 7.93. The non-linear dose-response
  relationship shows that sex-based vulnerability persists across consumption levels.

  description: At 80g/day, females show RR of 23.32 compared to male RR of 7.93, demonstrating persistent
    sex-specific vulnerability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The 23-fold increased risk for females at 80g/day consumption underscores urgent
    need for sex-specific public health interventions. Structural approaches should include sex-differentiated
    safe drinking guidelines, targeted screening in primary care, and gender-responsive alcohol treatment
    programs. Policy interventions on alcohol availability and pricing may have differential protective
    effects by sex.
