direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe acute pancreatitis from hypercalcemia causes extensive pancreatic
  necrosis and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Repeated or severe pancreatic injury leads to fibrosis and permanent destruction
  of pancreatic parenchyma'
- 'Step 3: Loss of functional pancreatic tissue results in inadequate production of
  digestive enzymes (exocrine insufficiency) and insulin/glucagon (endocrine insufficiency)'
