direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy exposes the developing fetus
  to ethanol and its metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and disrupts fetal neural development
  and cellular proliferation'
- 'Step 3: This teratogenic exposure causes structural brain abnormalities and neurodevelopmental
  deficits'
- 'Step 4: The resulting constellation of physical, cognitive, and behavioral impairments
  manifests as FASD'
