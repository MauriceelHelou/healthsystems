mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants aggregate into polygenic scores reflecting inherited cognitive performance
  potential'
- 'Step 2: Higher cognitive performance PGS associated with neurobiological substrates supporting executive
  function and impulse control'
- 'Step 3: These genetic factors may influence reward processing and decision-making circuits relevant
  to addiction vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Higher PGS for cognitive performance confers protection against AUD diagnosis'

description: Higher polygenic scores for cognitive performance are associated with 17% reduced odds of
  alcohol use disorder diagnosis in the Yale-Penn cohort of European-ancestry individuals. This genetic
  evidence supports a biological pathway linking cognitive capacity to AUD risk.

  equity_implications: While this mechanism involves genetic factors, it is important to recognize that
    gene expression is influenced by environmental context. Structural factors that create differential
    environments (poverty, education access, toxic exposures) can modify how genetic predispositions manifest.
    This finding should not be used to essentialize AUD risk but rather to understand how structural environments
    interact with biology.
