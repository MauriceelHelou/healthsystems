direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low preoperative bone mineral density (BMD) as measured by T-score indicates compromised bone
  quality in surgical candidates'
- 'Step 2: Reduced BMD leads to weakened vertebral bone structure at the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV)
  and adjacent segments'
- 'Step 3: Following adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery, mechanical stress concentrates at the proximal
  junction between fused and unfused spine segments'
- 'Step 4: Weakened bone is unable to adequately support the instrumentation and resist the biomechanical
  forces at the junction'
- 'Step 5: Progressive kyphotic deformity develops at the proximal junction, resulting in proximal junctional
  kyphosis (PJK)'

description: This meta-analysis of 18 studies with 2185 patients demonstrates that low preoperative bone
  mineral density, as measured by T-score, is significantly associated with the development of proximal
  junctional kyphosis following adult spinal deformity surgery. Patients who developed PJK had T-scores
  that were on average 0.69 units lower than those who did not develop PJK.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism is primarily biological/clinical in nature, structural determinants
    of osteoporosis include nutrition access, physical activity opportunities, healthcare access for early
    diagnosis and treatment, and occupational factors. Populations with limited access to calcium/vitamin
    D rich foods, safe environments for weight-bearing exercise, or preventive healthcare may be at higher
    risk for low BMD and subsequent surgical complications. This represents a downstream consequence of
    upstream structural inequities in healthcare access and nutrition.
