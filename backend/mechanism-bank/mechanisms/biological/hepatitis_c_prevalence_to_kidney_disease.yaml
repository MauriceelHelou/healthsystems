direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection establishes chronic viral replication
  in the body, leading to systemic inflammation and immune complex formation'
- 'Step 2: HCV-associated immune complexes deposit in glomerular structures, causing
  HCV-associated glomerulonephritides (including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
  and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis)'
- 'Step 3: Beyond direct glomerular injury, HCV infection promotes systemic inflammation
  and metabolic dysregulation that accelerates kidney damage through mechanisms independent
  of glomerulonephritis'
- 'Step 4: The combination of direct glomerular injury and systemic effects leads
  to faster rates of GFR decline and CKD progression in HCV-infected individuals compared
  to uninfected patients'
- 'Step 5: Successful HCV treatment with direct-acting antivirals has been shown to
  slow the rate of GFR decline, supporting a causal relationship between HCV viremia
  and CKD progression'

description: Hepatitis C virus infection is an independent risk factor for faster
  rates of CKD progression. This relationship is mediated both through HCV-associated
  glomerulonephritides (including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemic
  vasculitis) and through mechanisms independent of direct glomerular disease. The
  KDIGO 2018 clinical practice guideline synthesis of 125 eligible studies supports
  this causal pathway, noting that successful HCV treatment with direct-acting antivirals
  results in slower GFR decline, providing evidence for reversibility of this effect.
