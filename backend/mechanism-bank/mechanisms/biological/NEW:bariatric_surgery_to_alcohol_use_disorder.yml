direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bariatric surgery alters gastrointestinal anatomy, reducing stomach capacity and modifying
  absorption pathways'
- 'Step 2: Post-surgical changes lead to faster alcohol absorption and higher peak blood alcohol concentrations'
- 'Step 3: Altered gut hormones (ghrelin, GLP-1) may affect reward pathways and alcohol sensitivity'
- 'Step 4: Psychological factors including addiction transfer and coping mechanism shifts may increase
  alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: Beyond two years post-surgery, these physiological and psychological changes manifest as increased
  alcohol use disorder risk'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies found that bariatric surgery is associated
  with increased risk of alcohol use disorders, particularly beyond 2 years post-surgery. While short-term
  outcomes (up to 2 years) showed improvement in alcohol consumption patterns (9/12 studies), longer-term
  follow-up (beyond 2 years) revealed worsening alcohol use behaviors (4/5 studies). Meta-analysis of
  6 articles did not find statistically significant differences at 1 year post-surgery.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights how medical interventions can have unintended consequences
    on substance use patterns. The healthcare system''s focus on weight loss outcomes may inadvertently
    create conditions for alcohol use disorder development. Structural considerations include: (1) Pre-surgical
    screening and counseling protocols for alcohol use; (2) Long-term post-surgical monitoring requirements;
    (3) Access to behavioral health support integrated with bariatric care; (4) Insurance coverage for
    extended follow-up care. Equity implications include potential differential access to comprehensive
    post-surgical support services based on insurance status, geographic location, and socioeconomic resources.'
