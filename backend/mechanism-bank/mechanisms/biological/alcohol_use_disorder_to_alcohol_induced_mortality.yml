direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Diagnosed AUD is associated with continued heavy alcohol consumption and difficulty achieving
  sustained abstinence'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to progressive hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular
  carcinoma'
- 'Step 3: Cardiovascular complications including alcoholic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias develop'
- 'Step 4: Neurological degeneration and increased risk of severe withdrawal complications including delirium
  tremens'
- 'Step 5: Multi-organ damage results in elevated mortality rate among AUD patients'

description: Patients diagnosed with alcohol use disorder have an elevated mortality rate of 3.13 per
  1000 person-years. This reflects the considerable health burden associated with AUD, including direct
  alcohol toxicity and related chronic diseases.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: AUD mortality is influenced by structural factors including treatment availability,
    healthcare access, insurance coverage for substance use disorders, stigma in healthcare settings,
    and social determinants affecting recovery support. Medication-assisted treatment and evidence-based
    psychosocial interventions can reduce mortality but remain underutilized due to system-level barriers.
    Structural racism and economic inequality create differential access to quality treatment.
