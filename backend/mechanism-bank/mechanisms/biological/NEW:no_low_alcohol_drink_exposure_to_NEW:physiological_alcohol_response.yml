direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with AUD encounter NoLo drink cues (visual, olfactory, gustatory)'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-related cues activate learned associations from prior drinking history'
- 'Step 3: Conditioned physiological responses are triggered similar to actual alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: These responses may include autonomic nervous system activation and dopaminergic pathway engagement'

description: In populations with AUD, alcohol-related cues from NoLo drinks trigger physiological responses
  similar to those experienced when consuming actual alcohol, through conditioned learning mechanisms.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This biological mechanism demonstrates how prior structural exposure to alcohol
    environments creates lasting physiological vulnerabilities. The conditioned response is not a choice
    but a biological consequence of environmental alcohol exposure history. Treatment and policy must
    account for these involuntary physiological responses.
