direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Impaired emotion regulation capacity is associated with autonomic dysregulation measurable
  via RSA'
- 'Step 2: Poor emotion regulation leads to use of substances to manage emotional states'
- 'Step 3: Chronic substance use develops into substance use disorder requiring treatment'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with emotion dysregulation enter SUD treatment at higher rates'

description: The study emphasizes emotion regulation as increasingly recognized for SUD prevention and
  treatment, with RSA serving as a physiological biomarker that could identify individuals needing targeted
  interventions including interoceptive awareness training.

  equity_implications: This mechanism supports treatment approaches that address physiological regulation
    capacity rather than focusing solely on substance use behaviors. The recommendation to include RSA
    biomarkers in clinical studies could improve identification of individuals needing targeted mind-body
    interventions, representing a shift toward biologically-informed, trauma-responsive treatment rather
    than punitive or purely behavioral approaches.
