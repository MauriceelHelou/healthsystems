direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restricted eating windows (4-8 hours) create extended fasting periods of 16-20 hours daily'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged fasting enhances lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation for energy'
- 'Step 3: Improved insulin sensitivity from circadian-aligned eating promotes fat mobilization'
- 'Step 4: Metabolic regulatory improvements support preferential fat mass loss over lean mass'
- 'Step 5: Sustained intervention results in measurable reductions in body fat composition'

description: Time-restricted eating with 4-8 hour feeding windows leads to significant reductions in fat
  mass in adults with overweight and obesity. This effect was observed in interventions lasting at least
  8 weeks, suggesting metabolic adaptations require sustained implementation.

  equity_implications: Body composition changes through TRE may be differentially accessible based on
    structural factors including occupation type, household responsibilities, and food security status.
    Individuals with caregiving duties, multiple jobs, or food-insecure households may struggle to maintain
    consistent eating windows.
