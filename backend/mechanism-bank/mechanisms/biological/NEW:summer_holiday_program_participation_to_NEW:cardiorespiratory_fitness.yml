description: Summer holiday programs showed a non-significant effect on cardiorespiratory fitness (g=0.43,
  95%CI=-0.32, 1.17). While the direction suggests potential benefit, the wide confidence interval crossing
  zero indicates insufficient evidence for a reliable effect on this outcome.

  equity_implications: While not statistically significant, this finding suggests potential benefits that
    may require longer program duration or more intensive physical activity components to achieve. The
    structural opportunity to improve cardiovascular health in children during summer remains important
    for addressing health equity.
