description: Alcohol-related liver disease significantly increases all-cause mortality through both hepatic
  complications and the additional burden of extra-hepatic conditions including cancers, cardiovascular
  disease, and other organ damage caused by chronic alcohol exposure.

  equity_implications: 'All-cause mortality in ALD patients reflects failures across multiple structural
    systems: limited alcohol treatment availability, fragmented healthcare that separates addiction and
    medical care, socioeconomic barriers to healthy alternatives to alcohol use, and the commercial determinants
    of health from the alcohol industry. Addressing mortality requires policy interventions including
    alcohol pricing, marketing restrictions, and integrated care models.'
