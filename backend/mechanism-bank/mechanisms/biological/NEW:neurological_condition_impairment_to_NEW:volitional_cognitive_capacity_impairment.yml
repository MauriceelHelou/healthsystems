mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acquired neurological conditions (e.g., brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, dementia) affect
  prefrontal cortex and limbic system function'
- 'Step 2: Neurological damage impairs executive function, impulse control, and judgment'
- 'Step 3: Impaired volitional and cognitive capacities reduce ability to conform behavior to legal and
  social norms'
- 'Step 4: Reduced self-determination capacity affects criminal responsibility assessment'

description: Neurological conditions affecting brain function can significantly impair volitional and
  cognitive capacities, which has implications for forensic assessment of criminal responsibility. The
  paper argues that acquired forms of paedophilic disorder due to neurological damage require different
  forensic evaluation approaches.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how medical/biological conditions create differential
    legal outcomes. The paper argues against incarceration when neurological conditions impair capacity,
    advocating for treatment in specialized non-custodial facilities. This represents a structural approach
    to criminal justice that considers underlying medical conditions rather than treating all offenses
    uniformly.
