direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption may have different acute effects on the HPT axis than chronic
  heavy use'
- 'Step 2: Moderate intake appears to be associated with slightly higher testosterone levels'
- 'Step 3: The biological mechanism may involve acute stimulatory effects on the HPT axis at lower doses'
- 'Step 4: This contrasts with the suppressive effects seen at higher chronic consumption levels'

description: 'Subgroup analysis revealed that moderate alcohol intake was associated with significantly
  higher testosterone levels compared to non-exposed individuals (SMD 0.22, 95% CI: 0.12-0.32). Low intake
  also showed higher testosterone (SMD 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-0.35). This suggests a complex dose-response
  relationship.'

  description: Both moderate (SMD 0.22) and low (SMD 0.19) alcohol intake showed significantly higher
    testosterone compared to non-exposed, suggesting a non-linear relationship
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights the complexity of alcohol's effects on hormonal health.
    Structural factors such as alcohol pricing policies, taxation, and marketing regulations influence
    population-level consumption patterns. Understanding dose-response relationships is critical for evidence-based
    policy that addresses the spectrum from moderate use to alcohol use disorder.
