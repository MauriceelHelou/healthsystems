mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mild cognitive impairment leads to deficits in attention function'
- 'Step 2: Impaired attention reduces ability to monitor environment and maintain balance'
- 'Step 3: Reduced situational awareness increases risk of tripping hazards and obstacles'
- 'Step 4: Falls and fall-related injuries increase among older adults with attention deficits'

description: The abstract explicitly identifies falls as a consequence of attention deficits in older
  adults with MCI. This establishes a pathway from cognitive impairment through attention dysfunction
  to injury outcomes.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Fall risk is compounded by structural factors including housing quality, accessibility
    features, and neighborhood walkability. Older adults with MCI in housing lacking safety modifications
    face compounded risk. Access to cognitive training programs that could mitigate attention deficits
    is itself structurally determined.
