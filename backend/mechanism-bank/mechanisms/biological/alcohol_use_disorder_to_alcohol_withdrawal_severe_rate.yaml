direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in alcohol use disorder leads to neuroadaptive
  changes, specifically downregulation of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors
  and upregulation of excitatory glutamate (NMDA) receptors'
- 'Step 2: Upon cessation or significant reduction of alcohol intake, there is an
  imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, with loss of GABA-mediated
  inhibition and unopposed glutamatergic excitation'
- 'Step 3: This neurochemical imbalance manifests as hyperexcitability of the central
  nervous system, leading to alcohol withdrawal syndrome symptoms ranging from mild
  anxiety to severe manifestations'
- 'Step 4: In patients with prolonged heavy alcohol use, the magnitude of neuroadaptive
  changes is greater, increasing risk for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome including
  delirium tremens and withdrawal seizures'
- 'Step 5: History of previous delirium tremens (LR 2.9) and baseline systolic blood
  pressure ≥140 mmHg (LR 1.7) are clinical predictors of progression to severe withdrawal,
  reflecting underlying autonomic dysregulation from chronic alcohol exposure'

description: 'Alcohol use disorder leads to severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome through
  neuroadaptive changes in GABA and glutamate receptor systems. Chronic alcohol exposure
  causes downregulation of inhibitory GABA receptors and upregulation of excitatory
  NMDA receptors. Upon alcohol cessation, the resulting neurotransmitter imbalance
  creates central nervous system hyperexcitability, manifesting as withdrawal symptoms.
  The severity of withdrawal correlates with duration and intensity of alcohol use,
  with chronic heavy users at highest risk for severe manifestations including delirium
  tremens (prevalence among hospitalized at-risk patients: 1.4%) and withdrawal seizures.
  Clinical prediction tools like PAWSS (LR 174 for ≥4 findings) can identify high-risk
  patients.'
