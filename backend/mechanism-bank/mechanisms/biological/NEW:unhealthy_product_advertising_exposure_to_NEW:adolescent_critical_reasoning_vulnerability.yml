direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advertising targeting young people exploits developmental windows when cognition is still maturing'
- 'Step 2: Even when adolescents understand advertising persuasive intent, this cognitive knowledge does
  not translate to protection'
- 'Step 3: Affective/emotional processing of advertising may bypass rational critique systems'
- 'Step 4: Developing prefrontal cortex during adolescence limits ability to translate understanding into
  behavioral resistance'
- 'Step 5: Critical reasoning abilities are not fully developed during adolescence despite assumptions
  in regulatory frameworks'

description: Evidence demonstrates that critical reasoning abilities are not fully developed during adolescence,
  contradicting regulatory assumptions. The review found that greater understanding of advertising did
  not protect against its influence on attitudes, indicating a developmental vulnerability that extends
  through teenage years.

  description: Assumption that older adolescents are more protected was not supported; vulnerability persists
    through age 17
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how advertising policy has been built on a faulty assumption
    about adolescent cognitive development. The structural issue is that industry benefits from this assumption,
    as it allows continued targeting of adolescents with unhealthy product marketing. Recognizing that
    adolescent neurodevelopment creates ongoing vulnerability shifts the policy conversation from individual
    responsibility to structural protections.
