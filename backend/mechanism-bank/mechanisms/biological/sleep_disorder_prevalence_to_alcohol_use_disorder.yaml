direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep disorders (particularly insomnia) create physiological stress and
  dysregulate circadian rhythms, increasing perceived stress and negative affect'
- 'Step 2: Sleep disturbances impair cognitive control and impulse regulation while
  simultaneously increasing alcohol craving as individuals seek self-medication for
  sleep problems'
- 'Step 3: The combination of reduced inhibitory control, increased stress/negative
  affect, and heightened alcohol craving leads to hazardous drinking patterns and
  development of alcohol use disorder'

description: Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, create a cascade of neurobiological
  and psychological changes that increase vulnerability to alcohol use disorder. Sleep
  disturbances dysregulate stress response systems and circadian rhythms, leading
  to increased perceived stress and negative affect. This physiological dysregulation
  impairs cognitive control and impulse regulation while simultaneously increasing
  alcohol craving as individuals attempt to self-medicate sleep problems. The combination
  of reduced inhibitory control, heightened stress, and increased craving creates
  a pathway toward hazardous drinking patterns and eventual alcohol use disorder development.
structural_competency_notes: This pathway may be amplified by structural factors including
  limited access to sleep disorder treatment, work schedules that disrupt circadian
  rhythms, environmental stressors that compound sleep difficulties, and healthcare
  systems that may not adequately screen for or treat comorbid sleep and substance
  use disorders, particularly in vulnerable populations such as veterans.
