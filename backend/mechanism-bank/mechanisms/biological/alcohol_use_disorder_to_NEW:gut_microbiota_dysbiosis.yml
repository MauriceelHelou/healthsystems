description: Alcohol use disorder causes significant alterations in intestinal microbiota composition,
  creating dysbiosis that differs markedly from healthy individuals.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on biological pathways, understanding the gut-brain
    axis provides targets for therapeutic intervention that can address AUD-related complications without
    stigmatizing individual behavior.
