mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HER2-low expression (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) represents a distinct biological subtype of hormone
  receptor-positive breast cancer'
- 'Step 2: Low-level HER2 expression may confer reduced sensitivity to CDK 4/6 inhibitor therapy through
  altered cell cycle regulation'
- 'Step 3: Diminished CDK 4/6 inhibitor efficacy leads to continued tumor cell proliferation and disease
  progression'
- 'Step 4: Higher progression-free survival hazard indicates faster disease advancement compared to HER2-zero
  tumors'

description: HER2-low tumor status is associated with a 22% higher risk of progression and/or death compared
  to HER2-zero tumors in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer treated with
  CDK 4/6 inhibitors. This suggests HER2-low may be a biomarker for reduced treatment efficacy.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This is primarily a biological/clinical mechanism rather than a structural determinant.
    However, recognition of HER2-low as a distinct category with treatment implications has healthcare
    access implications - patients may benefit from alternative therapeutic strategies, and access to
    HER2-targeting agents (like trastuzumab deruxtecan) may become relevant for this population. Equity
    considerations include whether biomarker testing and newer targeted therapies are equally accessible
    across demographic groups.
