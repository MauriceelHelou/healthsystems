description: Alcohol consumption and AUD share genetic overlap characterized by variants associated with
  decreased frontocortical thickness, suggesting consumption leads to AUD through progressive neurobiological
  changes affecting frontal brain regions.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that the pathway from consumption to disorder involves
    structural brain changes, supporting policies that limit alcohol availability and marketing rather
    than focusing solely on individual willpower. Structural interventions that reduce population-level
    consumption can prevent progression to AUD.
