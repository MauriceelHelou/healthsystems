- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes direct toxic effects on renal tubular function'
- 'Step 2: The kidney''s normal response to hypomagnesemia (increased tubular reabsorption) is blunted'
- 'Step 3: Urinary magnesium wasting continues despite low serum magnesium levels'
- 'Step 4: This inappropriate renal handling perpetuates and worsens magnesium depletion'

description: The kidney plays a crucial role in magnesium depletion in chronic alcohol-use disorder. Normally,
  kidneys conserve magnesium when serum levels drop, but chronic alcohol use blunts this compensatory
  response, leading to continued magnesium loss even when the body is deficient.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This biological pathway shows how chronic alcohol exposure creates organ-level
    dysfunction that perpetuates nutritional deficiency. From a structural lens, populations with limited
    access to alcohol treatment services, those experiencing housing instability, or communities with
    high alcohol outlet density face greater exposure to chronic alcohol use and thus greater risk of
    this renal impairment. Healthcare access disparities may delay recognition and treatment of magnesium
    depletion.
