description: Alcohol consumption during adolescence directly impairs cognitive development through neurobiological
  pathways, consistent with established neuroscience evidence on the vulnerability of the developing brain
  to alcohol's neurotoxic effects.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural availability of alcohol to youth creates
    biological harm during a critical developmental window. The focus is on environmental exposure rather
    than individual choice, recognizing adolescent brain vulnerability as a biological fact requiring
    structural protection.
