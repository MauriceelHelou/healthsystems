description: Chronic alcohol misuse accelerates normal brain aging processes. This is evidenced through
  neuroimaging studies showing atrophy and degeneration, supported by postmortem pathology findings. Unlike
  neurodegenerative diseases, this accelerated aging may be partially reversible with abstinence.

  description: Reversibility of brain damage following abstinence from chronic alcohol misuse suggests
    neuroplasticity potential
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Understanding accelerated brain aging from AUD points to the need for structural
    interventions that address alcohol availability, marketing, and treatment access. The generational
    increase in alcohol consumption among older adults reflects broader social and policy environments
    that enable harmful drinking patterns.
