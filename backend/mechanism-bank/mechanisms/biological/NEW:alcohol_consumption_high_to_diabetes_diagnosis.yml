direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High alcohol consumption (above 49g/day) exceeds metabolic threshold'
- 'Step 2: Chronic high alcohol intake leads to pancreatic damage and impaired insulin secretion'
- 'Step 3: Hepatic dysfunction from alcohol affects glucose homeostasis'
- 'Step 4: Loss of protective effect and potential increased diabetes risk at high consumption levels'

description: The J-shaped relationship indicates that while moderate consumption shows protection, the
  protective association ceases above 49g of alcohol per day in women. At this threshold, RR was 0.82
  (95% CI 0.68-0.99), barely maintaining statistical significance for any protective effect.

  description: At 49g/day, the protective association ceases (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68-0.99 - barely significant),
    indicating the threshold where protection disappears
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: High alcohol consumption is not randomly distributed in the population. Structural
    factors including alcohol outlet density in low-income neighborhoods, targeted marketing to marginalized
    communities, lack of access to mental health services, and economic stressors contribute to patterns
    of harmful alcohol use. The loss of any protective effect at high consumption levels, combined with
    well-documented harms of heavy drinking, underscores the importance of structural interventions (pricing
    policies, outlet density restrictions, marketing regulations) rather than individual behavior change
    messaging.
