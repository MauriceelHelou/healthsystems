description: The study identified shared brain tissue enrichment of heritability, specifically finding
  that genes expressed in midbrain and striatal tissues contribute to both sensation seeking and alcohol
  consumption phenotypes. This provides a neurobiological basis for understanding why these traits co-occur
  at both phenotypic and genetic levels.

  equity_implications: Identifying specific brain tissue involvement moves understanding from behavioral
    description to biological mechanism. This neurobiological evidence supports viewing addiction vulnerability
    as partly constitutive rather than purely volitional, which has implications for reducing stigma and
    informing policy approaches to alcohol harm reduction.
