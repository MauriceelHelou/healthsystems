mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy exposes developing fetus to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure induces epigenetic alterations including histone modifications and DNA methylation
  changes'
- 'Step 3: These epigenetic changes affect gene expression in the developing HPA axis'
- 'Step 4: Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) expression is activated/upregulated'
- 'Step 5: Long-term HPA axis dysfunction persists into adulthood'

description: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes epigenetic modifications that dysregulate the developing
  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with effects persisting into adulthood. This represents intergenerational
  transmission of harm from maternal alcohol exposure to offspring stress response systems.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how prenatal exposures create lasting biological vulnerability.
    Structural factors driving maternal alcohol use (economic stress, lack of treatment access, alcohol
    availability) are upstream determinants. Addressing alcohol policy, treatment access, and social determinants
    during pregnancy could prevent these epigenetic harms.
