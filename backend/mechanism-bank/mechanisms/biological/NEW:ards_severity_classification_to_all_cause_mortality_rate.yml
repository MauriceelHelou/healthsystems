- 'Step 1: Moderate ARDS is classified by PaO2/FiO2 ratio 100-200 mmHg'
- 'Step 2: Significant hypoxemia impairs oxygen delivery to vital organs'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory lung injury progresses with potential for worsening'
- 'Step 4: Mechanical ventilation requirements increase complications risk'

description: Moderate ARDS increases mortality rate by 16%, demonstrating a graded relationship between
  ARDS severity and attributable mortality. This intermediate effect size between mild (non-significant)
  and severe ARDS supports the biological plausibility of the causal relationship.

  equity_implications: Early recognition and optimal management of moderate ARDS may prevent progression
    to severe ARDS. Healthcare systems with robust critical care training, nurse-to-patient ratios, and
    protocol-driven care may achieve better outcomes, representing structural determinants of survival.
