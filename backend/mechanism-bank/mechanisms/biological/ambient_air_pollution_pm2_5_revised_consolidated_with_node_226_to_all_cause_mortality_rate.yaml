direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is inhaled deeply into the lungs due to
  its small aerodynamic diameter (<2.5 μm), allowing particles to penetrate the alveoli
  and enter systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 triggers local pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress, releasing
  pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial dysfunction, accelerated atherosclerosis,
  and vascular damage, increasing cardiovascular disease risk'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure leads to cumulative damage to cardiovascular and respiratory
  systems, including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease'
- 'Step 5: These pathophysiological changes result in increased risk of death from
  cardiovascular causes (primary pathway) and respiratory causes, contributing to
  elevated all-cause mortality'

description: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is consistently and significantly associated
  with increased all-cause mortality across extensive global evidence. Meta-analyses
  of over 100 cohort studies demonstrate approximately 6% excess mortality risk per
  10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure. The biological mechanism involves deep lung
  penetration of fine particles, triggering systemic inflammation and oxidative stress
  that promotes cardiovascular disease (particularly ischemic heart disease) and respiratory
  disease. Short-term exposure studies across 652 cities globally confirm 0.68% increase
  in daily mortality per 10 μg/m3 PM2.5 increment. The association is robust after
  adjustment for gaseous pollutants and shows a consistent concentration-response
  relationship with no evidence of a safe threshold.
