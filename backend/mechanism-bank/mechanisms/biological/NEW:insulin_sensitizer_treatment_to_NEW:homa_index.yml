direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insulin sensitizers (metformin or myo-inositol) administered to PCOS patients'
- 'Step 2: Improved peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity'
- 'Step 3: Reduced compensatory hyperinsulinemia'
- 'Step 4: HOMA index decreases indicating improved insulin resistance'

description: 'No significant difference between metformin and myo-inositol on HOMA index (SMD=0.17, 95%
  CI: -0.53-0.88, p=.635), demonstrating equivalent effects on insulin resistance markers in PCOS women.'

  equity_implications: Both treatments show equivalent efficacy for insulin resistance, a key metabolic
    feature of PCOS. The availability of myo-inositol as a supplement may democratize access to effective
    PCOS treatment beyond the medical system.
