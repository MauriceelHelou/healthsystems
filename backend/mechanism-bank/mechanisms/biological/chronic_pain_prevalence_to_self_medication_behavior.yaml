- 'Step 1: Higher chronic pain prevalence creates unmet therapeutic needs and inadequate
  pain management through conventional medical care'
- 'Step 2: Patients seek alternative pain relief methods to address persistent pain
  symptoms and functional limitations'
- 'Step 3: Individuals engage in self-medication behaviors using analgesics, alcohol,
  cannabis, and other substances to manage chronic pain independently'

description: Chronic pain prevalence drives self-medication behavior through multiple
  pathways. Patients with chronic pain experience inadequate relief from conventional
  treatments, leading them to seek alternative therapeutic approaches. This includes
  self-medication with prescription analgesics (with 40% non-adherence rates), cannabis
  use (61.6% self-medicate without healthcare guidance), alcohol consumption for analgesic
  effects, and over-the-counter medication use. The relationship is mediated by factors
  including pain intensity, concerns about prescribed medications, previous treatment
  experiences, and perceived need for symptom management.
structural_competency_notes: Healthcare access barriers, stigma around pain treatment,
  inadequate provider education about pain management, and regulatory restrictions
  on pain medications contribute to self-medication behaviors. Socioeconomic factors
  influence both pain prevalence and access to appropriate care, creating disparities
  in treatment outcomes.
