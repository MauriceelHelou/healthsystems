direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol exposure during brain development alters white matter integrity
  and connectivity patterns'
- 'Step 2: Disrupted connectivity increases similarity in cortical thickness between
  spatially distant brain regions'
- 'Step 3: Increased long-distance structural covariance reduces the average number
  of steps needed to connect distant regions'
- 'Step 4: Shorter path lengths indicate altered information processing efficiency
  and less optimal network topology'
