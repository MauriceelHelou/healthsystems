  risk biomarkers for alcohol consumption, and predictive biomarkers for response to acamprosate treatment
  in subjects with AUD.'
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Metabolomic biomarkers have clinical utility for improving treatment outcomes through
    personalized medicine approaches. From a structural perspective, equitable access to advanced biomarker
    testing and personalized treatment is essential. Healthcare system factors (insurance coverage, treatment
    availability) will determine whether these scientific advances translate to reduced health inequities.
