mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: White matter integrity in anterior brain systems provides neural infrastructure for executive
  control'
- 'Step 2: Intact anterior corpus callosum and anterior corona radiata support inhibitory control networks'
- 'Step 3: White matter integrity moderates the relationship between momentary inhibitory control and
  substance use behavior'
- 'Step 4: Compromised white matter integrity in these regions undermines the ability to resist substance
  use even when attempting to exercise inhibitory control'
- 'Step 5: This creates a neurobiological vulnerability that increases probability of continued substance
  use'

description: Compromised white matter structural integrity in anterior brain systems (anterior corpus
  callosum, bilateral anterior corona radiata) underlies impairment in inhibitory control functional networks
  and compromised ability to refrain from substance use. This represents a neurobiological pathway through
  which structural brain changes maintain substance use disorders.

  description: The protective effect of white matter integrity against substance use operates through
    its moderation of inhibitory control. Higher integrity enables inhibitory control to be more effective
    in preventing use.

  equity_implications: 'This biological mechanism is shaped by structural determinants: (1) Access to
    treatment affects potential for neural recovery; (2) Chronic stress from poverty, discrimination,
    and unstable housing can accelerate white matter degradation; (3) Environmental neurotoxin exposure
    varies by neighborhood and occupational status; (4) Historical and ongoing trauma affects brain development
    and maintenance. Interventions should address structural barriers to treatment and recovery support,
    not blame individuals for neurobiological vulnerability. Equity implications include ensuring treatment
    access that supports neural recovery across all populations.'
