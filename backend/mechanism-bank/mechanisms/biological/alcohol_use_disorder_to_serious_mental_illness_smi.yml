mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder frequently co-occurs with mental health disorders'
- 'Step 2: Bidirectional relationship where alcohol use exacerbates mental health symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Shared neurobiological and psychosocial vulnerability factors link both conditions'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring conditions create compound clinical complexity requiring integrated treatment
  approaches'

description: The meta-analysis is premised on the high comorbidity between alcohol/drug use disorders
  and mental health disorders, which necessitates integrated treatment approaches. This co-occurrence
  creates complex clinical presentations that single-disorder treatments inadequately address.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The co-occurrence of substance use and mental health disorders often reflects shared
    structural determinants including poverty, trauma exposure, housing instability, and lack of healthcare
    access. Treatment systems that fail to address this comorbidity perpetuate health inequities. Structural
    factors like insurance carve-outs that separate behavioral health from medical care create systemic
    barriers to integrated treatment.
