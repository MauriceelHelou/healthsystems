mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption associated with alcohol use disorder
  leads to direct cardiotoxic effects on myocardial tissue'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol toxicity causes mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and
  cellular damage in cardiac myocytes leading to impaired contractility'
- 'Step 3: Progressive myocardial damage results in left ventricular dilation, reduced
  ejection fraction, and development of alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy through
  direct cardiotoxic effects of chronic heavy alcohol consumption. The mechanism involves
  alcohol-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in cardiac myocytes,
  resulting in progressive myocardial damage, left ventricular dysfunction, and eventual
  development of dilated cardiomyopathy. Recovery of ventricular heart function has
  been demonstrated with alcohol reduction, supporting the causal relationship.
structural_competency_notes: Access to alcohol treatment and cardiac care services
  may influence the progression and management of alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy,
  with disparities in healthcare access potentially affecting early detection and
  intervention opportunities.
