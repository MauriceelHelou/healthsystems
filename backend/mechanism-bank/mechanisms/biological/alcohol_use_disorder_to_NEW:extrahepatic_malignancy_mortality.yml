direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)'
- 'Step 2: Patients with ALD have systemic alcohol exposure affecting multiple organ systems'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol acts as carcinogen through acetaldehyde metabolites and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of malignancies in organs beyond the liver (esophageal, colorectal, breast,
  etc.)'
- 'Step 5: Higher mortality from extra-hepatic cancers in ALD population'

description: Patients with alcohol-related liver disease face elevated risk of death from cancers outside
  the liver due to systemic effects of chronic alcohol exposure, which acts as a carcinogen across multiple
  organ systems.

  description: More severe ALD may indicate higher cumulative alcohol exposure and greater extra-hepatic
    risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects downstream health consequences of alcohol use disorder,
    which itself is shaped by structural factors including alcohol marketing, outlet density, pricing
    policies, and lack of treatment access. The burden falls disproportionately on populations with limited
    access to healthcare and addiction services.
