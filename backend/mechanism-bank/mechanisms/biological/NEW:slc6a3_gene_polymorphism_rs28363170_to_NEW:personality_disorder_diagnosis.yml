direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals carry the rs28363170 polymorphism with 9-repeat allele variant in the SLC6A3 (dopamine
  transporter) gene'
- 'Step 2: This genetic variant affects dopamine transporter expression and function, altering dopaminergic
  neurotransmission'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulated dopamine signaling impacts reward processing, impulse control, and emotional regulation
  circuits'
- 'Step 4: These neurobiological alterations contribute to the development of socially dysfunctional behavioral
  patterns characteristic of personality disorders'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis found a statistically significant association between
  the SLC6A3 gene polymorphism rs28363170 (specifically the 9-repeat allele) and personality disorders
  in European populations under co-dominant inheritance. The dopamine transporter gene variant affects
  dopaminergic neurotransmission, which is implicated in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying personality
  disorders.

  equity_implications: 'While this mechanism is primarily biological/genetic, structural factors influence
    how genetic vulnerabilities manifest: access to mental healthcare, diagnostic disparities across populations,
    and socioeconomic factors that determine whether genetic predispositions lead to clinical disorders.
    The finding of population-specific effects (European ancestry) highlights the need for diverse representation
    in genetic research. Understanding genetic contributions should inform personalized medicine approaches
    rather than deterministic views, and should not obscure the role of structural factors in mental health
    outcomes.'
