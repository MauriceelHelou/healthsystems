  node_name: Hypomagnesemia (Low Blood Magnesium)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to dietary magnesium depletion through poor nutritional intake'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol directly impairs intestinal magnesium absorption'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol exposure blunts the kidney''s normal compensatory response to low magnesium
  (impaired renal conservation)'
- 'Step 4: Skeletal muscle magnesium stores become depleted, reducing the body''s magnesium reservoir'
- 'Step 5: Both total and ionized circulating magnesium levels become markedly reduced'

description: 'Chronic alcohol-use disorder causes marked reduction in both total and ionized circulating
  magnesium through multiple mechanisms: dietary depletion, impaired intestinal absorption, blunted renal
  conservation response, and skeletal muscle magnesium depletion. This meta-analysis of 25 studies confirms
  hypomagnesemia is common in chronic alcohol-use disorder.'

  description: The mechanism specifically applies to chronic alcohol-use disorder, suggesting duration
    and severity of alcohol use affects magnitude of magnesium depletion

  strength: moderate
  description: The kidney plays a crucial role in magnesium depletion development; impaired renal handling
    exacerbates the condition
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how a behaviorally-linked condition (alcohol use disorder)
    produces physiological harm through metabolic pathways. From a structural perspective, alcohol use
    disorder itself is shaped by social determinants including economic stress, trauma, neighborhood alcohol
    outlet density, and lack of access to treatment. The downstream magnesium depletion can contribute
    to cardiovascular complications, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms that compound health inequities
    in populations with high rates of alcohol use disorder.
