description: Each additional standard drink per day is associated with a 3% increased risk of premenopausal
  breast cancer. While the effect is smaller than for postmenopausal breast cancer, it demonstrates that
  alcohol consumption poses breast cancer risk across the lifespan.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Younger women face unique structural exposures including college drinking culture,
    workplace social drinking norms, and targeted alcohol marketing. Social environments and peer networks
    strongly influence consumption patterns. Interventions targeting campus policies, workplace cultures,
    and advertising restrictions could reduce exposure among premenopausal women.
