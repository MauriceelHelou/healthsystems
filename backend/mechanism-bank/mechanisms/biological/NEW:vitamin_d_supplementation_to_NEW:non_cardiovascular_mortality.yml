mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vitamin D supplementation increases circulating vitamin D metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Vitamin D exerts immunomodulatory effects that may reduce infection-related mortality'
- 'Step 3: Vitamin D may influence cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects on multiple non-cardiovascular disease pathways approach but do not reach
  statistical significance for mortality reduction'

description: Meta-analysis found vitamin D supplementation was close to statistical significance for reduced
  non-cardiovascular mortality (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87-1.00, p=0.055). This borderline finding suggests
  potential benefits for mortality from causes such as infections, cancer, or other non-cardiovascular
  conditions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Non-cardiovascular mortality encompasses deaths from infections, cancers, and other
    conditions that are heavily influenced by social determinants including housing conditions, occupational
    exposures, access to preventive care, and environmental quality. Vitamin D deficiency itself is socially
    patterned, with higher prevalence in populations with limited sun exposure due to indoor work, institutionalization,
    or living in areas with high pollution.
