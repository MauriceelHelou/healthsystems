direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant women inhale ambient PM2.5 particles, which penetrate deep into
  the respiratory system and enter systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 induces systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, affecting placental
  function and fetal development'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory responses and oxidative damage impair placental nutrient and
  oxygen transfer to the fetus'
- 'Step 4: Reduced placental efficiency leads to fetal growth restriction and lower
  birth weight'
- 'Step 5: PM2.5 exposure may also reduce gestational age, which independently contributes
  to lower birth weight'

description: Ambient PM2.5 pollution exposure during pregnancy is associated with
  an 11% increased risk of low birth weight per 10 μg/m3 increment, and a mean reduction
  of 22 grams in birth weight. This meta-regression of 44 birth weight studies across
  204 countries demonstrates a robust association, with approximately 2.76 million
  LBW infants globally attributable to total PM2.5 exposure in 2019. The biological
  pathway involves systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired placental
  function leading to fetal growth restriction.
