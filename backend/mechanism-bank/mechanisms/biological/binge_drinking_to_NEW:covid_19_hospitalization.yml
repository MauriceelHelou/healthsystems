- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption causes acute and chronic immune dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts gut barrier integrity allowing bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Pre-existing inflammation primes for exaggerated cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 4: Hyperinflammatory state leads to acute respiratory distress requiring hospitalization'

description: The meta-analysis specifically identified excessive drinkers as being at high risk for COVID-19
  hospitalization. This pattern-specific finding suggests dose-response relationship where heavy episodic
  drinking creates particularly high vulnerability to severe COVID-19 outcomes.

  description: Excessive drinkers specifically identified as high risk for COVID-19 hospitalization, beyond
    general drinking history
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Excessive drinking patterns are shaped by structural factors including alcohol
    pricing policies, outlet density, marketing exposure, and availability of alternative coping resources.
    During the pandemic, lockdown policies may have differentially affected drinking patterns across socioeconomic
    groups. Addressing pandemic-related alcohol harms requires structural interventions including price
    controls, marketing restrictions, and expanded access to substance use treatment services.
