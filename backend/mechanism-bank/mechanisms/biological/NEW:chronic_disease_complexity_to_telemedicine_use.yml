- 'Step 1: Multiple chronic conditions create complex health management needs'
- 'Step 2: Health-related barriers including physical and cognitive limitations increase with comorbidity'
- 'Step 3: Disease burden reduces energy and capacity available for learning new technologies'
- 'Step 4: Complex health needs may also increase motivation for technology adoption when properly supported'

  equity_implications: Chronic disease clustering reflects upstream social determinants including socioeconomic
    status, environmental exposures, and healthcare access across the lifecourse. Technology adoption
    barriers among those with complex health needs compound existing health inequities.
