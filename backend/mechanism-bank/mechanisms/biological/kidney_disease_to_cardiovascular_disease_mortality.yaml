  node_id: cardiovascular_disease_mortality

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic kidney disease leads to reduced glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
  and/or increased albuminuria, indicating impaired kidney function and glomerular
  barrier integrity'
- 'Step 2: Reduced kidney function causes accumulation of uremic toxins, fluid retention,
  electrolyte imbalances, and chronic inflammation that contribute to systemic vascular
  damage'
- 'Step 3: Albuminuria reflects endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular permeability,
  serving as both a marker and mediator of systemic vascular disease'
- 'Step 4: These pathophysiological changes accelerate atherosclerosis, promote left
  ventricular hypertrophy, increase arterial stiffness, and contribute to arrhythmogenesis'
- 'Step 5: The cumulative cardiovascular burden from these mechanisms increases the
  risk of fatal cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart
  failure, and sudden cardiac death'

description: This individual-participant data meta-analysis of 114 global cohorts
  involving over 27 million individuals demonstrates that chronic kidney disease,
  defined by either low eGFR or elevated albuminuria, is significantly associated
  with increased cardiovascular mortality. Both lower eGFR (whether measured by creatinine
  alone or creatinine plus cystatin C) and more severe albuminuria were independently
  and significantly associated with higher cardiovascular mortality risk. These associations
  were present even in the mildest categories of CKD, indicating that kidney dysfunction
  across its spectrum contributes to cardiovascular mortality through multiple pathophysiological
  mechanisms including uremic toxin accumulation, endothelial dysfunction, chronic
  inflammation, and accelerated vascular disease.
