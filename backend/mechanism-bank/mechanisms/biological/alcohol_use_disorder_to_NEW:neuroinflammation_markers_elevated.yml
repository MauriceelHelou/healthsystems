direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption leads to repeated exposure of neural tissue to ethanol and
  its metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism generates reactive oxygen species and acetaldehyde, triggering oxidative
  stress in brain tissue'
- 'Step 3: Oxidative stress activates microglia and astrocytes, initiating neuroimmune signaling cascades'
- 'Step 4: Activated glial cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other neuroimmune
  markers'
- 'Step 5: Sustained neuroinflammation contributes to neurodegeneration and altered brain function observed
  in postmortem studies'

description: Meta-analysis of postmortem studies demonstrates that individuals with alcohol use disorder
  show significantly higher levels of neuroimmune markers in brain tissue compared to healthy controls,
  with a large effect size (d=1.50). This provides direct evidence that chronic heavy alcohol consumption
  produces neuroinflammation detectable at the cellular/molecular level.

  description: Postmortem studies showed elevated neuroimmune markers while PET studies showed different

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on biological pathways, it connects to structural
    determinants through the social and economic factors that drive alcohol use disorder prevalence, including
    alcohol outlet density, alcohol marketing exposure, lack of access to treatment, and social environments
    that normalize heavy drinking. The neuroinflammation caused by AUD represents a biological embedding
    of these structural exposures. Structural interventions at the policy level (alcohol taxation, availability
    restrictions, treatment access) could prevent this neuroinflammatory damage.
