direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: DBS delivers continuous electrical stimulation to the nucleus accumbens'
- 'Step 2: Stimulation modulates activity in mesolimbic dopamine pathways involved in reward and craving'
- 'Step 3: Altered reward circuit function reduces the intensity of alcohol craving signals'
- 'Step 4: Reduced craving supports sustained abstinence and reduces relapse risk'

description: The DBS-EARLY ON group demonstrated significantly lower alcohol craving at 6 months compared
  to the sham stimulation group, indicating that nucleus accumbens stimulation directly modulates craving
  pathways.

  description: Higher baseline craving levels predicted better treatment response, suggesting those with
    more severe craving may benefit more from DBS
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol craving is a neurobiological phenomenon shaped by both individual brain
    chemistry and environmental exposures. Structural factors such as alcohol outlet density, alcohol
    advertising, and stress from economic insecurity can exacerbate craving. This intervention addresses
    the downstream biological manifestation while structural determinants continue to drive population-level
    craving and relapse.
