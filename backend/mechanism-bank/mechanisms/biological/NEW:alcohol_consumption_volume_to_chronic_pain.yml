direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption may provide acute analgesic effects through central nervous system
  depression'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol''s effects on GABA and opioid neurotransmitter systems may temporarily reduce pain
  perception'
- 'Step 3: Over time, baseline consumption patterns may be associated with reduced pain interference in
  general population'
- 'Step 4: However, this relationship reverses among those with advanced alcohol use disorder symptomatology'

description: In the general population, higher baseline alcohol consumption was associated with lower
  subsequent pain interference at 3-year follow-up. However, this protective pattern reversed among men
  with elevated AUD symptomatology, where higher consumption predicted greater pain interference, consistent
  with Koob's Dark Side of Alcohol Addiction theory.

  description: Among individuals with higher AUD symptom counts, particularly men, the relationship reverses
    - higher alcohol consumption becomes associated with higher subsequent pain interference
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the alcohol-pain relationship differs based on stage
    of alcohol use disorder progression. The finding that detrimental effects emerge at advanced AUD stages
    among men suggests differential vulnerability based on disease progression. Structural factors that
    contribute to AUD development (e.g., alcohol availability, marketing, treatment access) may indirectly
    influence pain outcomes.
