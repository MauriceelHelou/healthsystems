mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in alcohol use disorder leads to direct hepatotoxicity
  through acetaldehyde formation and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 2: Persistent alcohol exposure causes inflammatory cascade activation, complement
  protein dysregulation, and neutrophil infiltration in liver tissue'
- 'Step 3: Severe hepatic inflammation and necrosis develop into acute alcoholic hepatitis
  requiring hospitalization for management of life-threatening complications'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to alcoholic hepatitis hospitalization through
  direct hepatotoxic mechanisms involving inflammatory cascades, complement system
  activation, and neutrophil degranulation. Chronic alcohol consumption causes progressive
  liver injury that can acutely worsen into severe alcoholic hepatitis requiring immediate
  hospitalization for management of potentially fatal complications including multi-organ
  failure.
structural_competency_notes: Disparities in alcoholic hepatitis hospitalization rates
  are observed across demographic groups, with higher rates among racial and ethnic
  minorities, younger adults, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status, suggesting
  structural factors influence both alcohol use disorder development and access to
  preventive care.
