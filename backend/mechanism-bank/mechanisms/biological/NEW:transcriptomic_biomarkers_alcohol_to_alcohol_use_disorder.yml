- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption alters gene expression patterns (transcriptome) in relevant tissues'
- 'Step 2: Transcriptomic changes reflect both acute alcohol effects and chronic adaptations'
- 'Step 3: Altered gene expression profiles serve as diagnostic biomarkers for AUD detection'
- 'Step 4: Transcriptomic signatures may also serve as risk biomarkers indicating vulnerability to alcohol-related
  problems'

description: Transcriptomic information serves as diagnostic biomarkers for AUD and risk biomarkers for
  alcohol consumption. Gene expression profiles capture the dynamic biological response to alcohol and
  can aid in identifying individuals with AUD or at elevated risk.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Transcriptomic markers represent molecular-level consequences of alcohol exposure
    that is shaped by structural determinants. Improved diagnostics can reduce stigma by framing AUD as
    a biological condition while also highlighting the need for structural prevention strategies that
    reduce harmful alcohol exposure across populations.
