direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extreme heat exposure triggers physiological stress responses including
  increased respiratory rate and altered airway thermoregulation'
- 'Step 2: Heat stress induces airway inflammation, increased mucus production, and
  bronchial hyperresponsiveness in susceptible individuals'
- 'Step 3: Extreme temperatures often co-occur with elevated ground-level ozone and
  air pollutants, compounding respiratory irritation'
- 'Step 4: Combined thermal and pollution stress leads to increased frequency and
  severity of asthma exacerbations requiring medical intervention'

description: Extreme temperatures, particularly heat, increase asthma exacerbation
  rates through direct physiological effects on airways and indirect mechanisms involving
  increased air pollution formation. This systematic review for EAACI guidelines evaluated
  evidence on short-term exposure effects, finding that extreme temperatures represent
  a significant environmental threat for asthma patients, with effects compounded
  by climate change and concurrent air pollution exposure.
