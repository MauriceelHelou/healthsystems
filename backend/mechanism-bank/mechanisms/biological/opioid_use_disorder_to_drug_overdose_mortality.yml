description: The abstract notes that CJS populations with OUD have high rates of death upon release, reflecting
  the well-documented post-release overdose mortality spike. This is a structural issue related to lack
  of continuity of care, reduced tolerance, and barriers to treatment access.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Post-release overdose mortality is a consequence of carceral policies that fail
    to ensure treatment continuity. The structural failure to provide MOUD during and after incarceration,
    driven by stigma and concerns about diversion mentioned in this study, directly contributes to preventable
    deaths. This is a policy-modifiable structural determinant.
