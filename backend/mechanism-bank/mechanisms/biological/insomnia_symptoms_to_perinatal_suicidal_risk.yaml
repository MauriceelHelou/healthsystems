mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insomnia disrupts normal sleep architecture and circadian rhythms during
  the peripartum period'
- 'Step 2: Sleep disruption affects neurotransmitter regulation and stress response
  systems, exacerbating emotional dysregulation'
- 'Step 3: Compounded neurobiological vulnerability increases susceptibility to suicidal
  ideation and risk behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Effect persists even after accounting for perinatal depression as a confounding
  factor'
