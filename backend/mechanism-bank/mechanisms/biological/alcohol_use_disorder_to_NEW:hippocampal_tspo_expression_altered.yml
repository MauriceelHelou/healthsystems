- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure affects glial cell function in hippocampus, a brain region critical
  for memory and learning'
- 'Step 2: Translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of microglial activation, shows altered expression patterns'
- 'Step 3: PET imaging with [11C]PBR28 radioligand detects reduced TSPO binding in hippocampus of AUD
  patients'
- 'Step 4: Reduced TSPO total volume of distribution suggests altered neuroimmune homeostasis in this
  vulnerable brain region'
- 'Step 5: Hippocampal neuroimmune dysregulation may contribute to cognitive deficits observed in AUD'

description: PET imaging meta-analysis reveals that individuals with alcohol use disorder show significantly
  lower translocator protein (TSPO) binding in the hippocampus compared to healthy controls (g=-1.95,
  p<0.001). This large negative effect suggests that chronic alcohol exposure produces specific alterations
  in hippocampal neuroimmune signaling, potentially reflecting microglial dysfunction or neuronal loss
  in this memory-critical region.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The hippocampal TSPO findings represent biological evidence of brain changes resulting
    from chronic heavy alcohol use, which itself is shaped by structural factors including alcohol availability
    policies, pricing, marketing regulations, treatment accessibility, and social determinants that increase
    vulnerability to AUD. Communities with higher alcohol outlet density, weaker alcohol control policies,
    and limited mental health/addiction treatment resources may see higher rates of these neurobiological
    consequences. Equity implications include that marginalized communities often face both higher exposure
    to alcohol marketing and reduced access to AUD treatment.
