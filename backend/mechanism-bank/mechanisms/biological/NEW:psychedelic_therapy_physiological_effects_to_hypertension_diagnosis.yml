mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychedelic compounds administered during therapy session'
- 'Step 2: Serotonergic activity of psychedelics causes transient cardiovascular effects'
- 'Step 3: Blood pressure increases transiently during the psychedelic experience'
- 'Step 4: Requires medical monitoring and may be contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular conditions'

description: One trial reported transient increases in blood pressure during psychedelic therapy, a known
  pharmacological effect requiring further exploration to determine the balance of benefits to harms,
  particularly for patients with cardiovascular comorbidities.

  description: Patients with pre-existing hypertension or cardiovascular disease may experience greater
    risk from transient blood pressure elevations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cardiovascular safety monitoring requirements create structural barriers to psychedelic
    therapy access in settings without adequate medical infrastructure. This may limit access for populations
    in healthcare deserts or those without established primary care relationships for pre-treatment cardiovascular
    screening.
