direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Food insecurity leads to reliance on inexpensive, energy-dense, nutrient-poor
  foods that are high in refined carbohydrates and added sugars'
- 'Step 2: This dietary pattern promotes weight gain, particularly central adiposity,
  and increases metabolic stress through repeated glucose spikes'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to poor diet quality combined with cycles of food scarcity
  and overconsumption when food is available leads to insulin resistance'
- 'Step 4: Sustained insulin resistance progresses to impaired glucose tolerance and
  eventually clinical diabetes mellitus diagnosis'
- 'Step 5: Once diagnosed, food insecurity further impairs glycemic control through
  inability to maintain consistent, diabetes-appropriate nutrition'

description: Food insecurity is robustly associated with diabetes diagnosis in adults
  through biological pathways involving poor diet quality, weight gain, and metabolic
  dysfunction. The inability to consistently obtain nutritious food forces reliance
  on cheap, calorie-dense foods that promote obesity and insulin resistance. Once
  diabetes develops, food insecurity continues to impair glycemic control and increases
  risk of diabetes complications.
