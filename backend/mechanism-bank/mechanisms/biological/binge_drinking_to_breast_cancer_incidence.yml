mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher daily alcohol consumption (2-3 drinks) delivers substantial ethanol dose to breast tissue'
- 'Step 2: Increased acetaldehyde production overwhelms cellular detoxification capacity'
- 'Step 3: Sustained elevation of estrogen levels promotes hormone-dependent tumor growth'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation and immune suppression reduce cancer surveillance'
- 'Step 5: Dose-dependent carcinogenic effects manifest as substantially elevated breast cancer risk'

description: Consuming 3 standard drinks per day is associated with a 22% increased risk of breast cancer
  compared to non-drinking. The dose-response relationship demonstrates that higher consumption levels
  substantially increase risk, supporting evidence-based cancer prevention guidelines to reduce alcohol
  intake.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Heavy alcohol consumption patterns are shaped by structural factors including socioeconomic
    stress, alcohol outlet density in neighborhoods, pricing policies, and inadequate access to mental
    health services. Populations experiencing higher chronic stress or living in areas with greater alcohol
    availability may face disproportionate exposure. Policy interventions including minimum unit pricing,
    outlet density restrictions, and expanded substance use treatment access address root causes of heavy
    consumption patterns.
