mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated blood pressure causes chronic mechanical stress on arterial walls
  and endothelial damage'
- 'Step 2: Sustained hypertension accelerates atherosclerosis through vascular inflammation
  and lipid accumulation'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative exposure to elevated systolic blood pressure leads to progressive
  organ damage including cardiac remodeling and arterial stiffening'
- 'Step 4: Irreversible damage to major organs (heart, brain, kidneys) increases vulnerability
  to cardiovascular events'
- 'Step 5: Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) lead
  to increased mortality'

description: Hypertension is established as a leading cause of cardiovascular disease
  and related mortality worldwide. The mechanism operates through cumulative vascular
  damage, where sustained elevated blood pressure accelerates atherosclerosis and
  causes irreversible organ damage. The relationship demonstrates a dose-response
  pattern where longer duration of exposure to elevated systolic blood pressure proportionally
  increases cardiovascular disease risk. Early intervention to lower blood pressure
  before clinical hypertension develops may slow age-related vascular changes and
  reduce cumulative cardiovascular risk.
