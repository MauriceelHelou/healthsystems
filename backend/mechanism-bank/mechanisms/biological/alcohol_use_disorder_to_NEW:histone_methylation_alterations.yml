- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption affects one carbon metabolism and methyl group availability'
- 'Step 2: Altered methyl group availability impacts histone methyltransferase activity'
- 'Step 3: Histone methylation patterns are modified in brain and peripheral tissues'
- 'Step 4: Unlike DNA methylation, histone methylation can have bidirectional effects on gene expression'
- 'Step 5: These epigenetic changes contribute to AUD phenotypes and neuroadaptations'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to alterations in histone methylation through disruption of one
  carbon metabolism. Unlike DNA methylation which typically represses transcription, histone methylation
  can either increase or decrease gene expression depending on the specific modification.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The biological pathway demonstrates how alcohol exposure creates lasting epigenetic
    changes. Structural factors that increase alcohol exposure risk (availability, marketing, socioeconomic
    stress) ultimately manifest through these molecular mechanisms.
