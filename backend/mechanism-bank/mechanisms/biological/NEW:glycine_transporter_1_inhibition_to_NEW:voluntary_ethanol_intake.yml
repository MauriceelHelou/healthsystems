description: GlyT-1 inhibitors, which raise extracellular glycine levels, have repeatedly demonstrated
  decreased ethanol intake in rats, providing complementary evidence to direct glycine administration
  for targeting the glycinergic system in AUD treatment.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Development of GlyT-1 inhibitors as potential AUD medications represents a structural
    approach to addressing limited pharmacotherapy options. Translation to clinical use would require
    attention to equitable access in medication-assisted treatment programs.
