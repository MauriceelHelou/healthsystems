direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use reduces populations of SCFA-producing bacteria including Faecalibacterium
  prausnitzii'
- 'Step 2: Decreased bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber reduces production of butyrate, propionate,
  and acetate'
- 'Step 3: Loss of SCFAs impairs colonocyte nutrition and gut barrier function'
- 'Step 4: Reduced anti-inflammatory signaling from SCFAs promotes systemic inflammation'

description: Alcohol use disorder depletes bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, critical metabolites
  for gut health and systemic anti-inflammatory regulation

  description: Adequate dietary fiber may partially compensate for reduced SCFA-producing bacteria
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Food insecurity and limited access to healthy foods, which often co-occur with
    AUD in marginalized communities, may compound SCFA depletion by limiting dietary fiber intake. This
    represents an intersection of food environment and substance use structural factors.
