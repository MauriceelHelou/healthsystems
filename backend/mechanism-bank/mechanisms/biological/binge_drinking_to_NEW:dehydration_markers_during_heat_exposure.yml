direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-dose alcohol consumption has diuretic effects increasing urine output'
- 'Step 2: Increased urine volume contributes to fluid loss and potential dehydration'
- 'Step 3: Dehydration effects were only observed at higher alcohol doses, not moderate consumption'
- 'Step 4: Typical markers (urine volume, mass loss, plasma volume) were not consistently altered at moderate
  doses'

description: Contrary to common assumptions, typical markers of dehydration (increased urine volume, mass
  loss, decreased plasma volume) were not consistently observed with moderate alcohol consumption during
  heat exposure. Only the study with the highest alcohol dose showed consistent dehydration effects, suggesting
  a dose-dependent relationship.

  description: Dehydration effects only observed at highest alcohol doses tested; moderate doses (average
    0.68 g/kg) did not consistently produce dehydration markers

  equity_implications: This finding has implications for public health messaging during heat events. Current
    guidance often warns that alcohol causes dehydration and increases heat risk, but this evidence suggests
    the relationship is dose-dependent. Structural factors influencing heavy alcohol consumption patterns,
    including economic stress, limited recreational alternatives, and alcohol outlet density in vulnerable
    communities, may be more relevant to heat-health outcomes than moderate consumption. Policy approaches
    should address upstream determinants rather than individual drinking behavior alone.
