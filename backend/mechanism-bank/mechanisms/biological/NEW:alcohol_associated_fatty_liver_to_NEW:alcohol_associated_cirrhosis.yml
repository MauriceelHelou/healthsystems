description: The meta-analysis separately quantified fatty liver (18,844 cases) and cirrhosis (502 cases),
  reflecting the disease progression spectrum. Fatty liver represents early reversible disease that can
  progress to irreversible cirrhosis with continued alcohol exposure.

  equity_implications: The separation of fatty liver and cirrhosis in this analysis identifies a critical
    intervention window. Structural interventions that enable early detection and treatment of fatty liver
    - including healthcare access, AUD treatment availability, and routine screening protocols - could
    prevent progression to cirrhosis. The dramatic difference in case counts (18,844 fatty liver vs 502
    cirrhosis) suggests many with early disease never progress, indicating prevention opportunities.
