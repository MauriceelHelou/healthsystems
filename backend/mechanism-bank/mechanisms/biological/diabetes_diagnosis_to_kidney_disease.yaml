mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic hyperglycemia from diabetes causes glycation of proteins and accumulation
  of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in kidney tissue'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood glucose leads to glomerular hyperfiltration and increased
  intraglomerular pressure, damaging the filtration apparatus'
- 'Step 3: Poor glycemic control and prolonged diabetes duration cause progressive
  microvascular damage to renal blood vessels'
- 'Step 4: Concurrent hypertension (systolic BP >140 mmHg) accelerates nephron damage
  through additional hemodynamic stress'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative damage leads to albuminuria, declining glomerular filtration
  rate, and progression through CKD stages'

description: Diabetes diagnosis significantly increases the risk of chronic kidney
  disease through multiple pathophysiological mechanisms including chronic hyperglycemia-induced
  microvascular damage, glomerular hyperfiltration, and progressive nephron loss.
  Meta-analysis of 12 studies in Ethiopia found 35.5% prevalence of CKD stages 1-5
  among diabetic patients, with risk substantially increased by longer diabetes duration,
  poor glycemic control, concurrent hypertension, and older age.
