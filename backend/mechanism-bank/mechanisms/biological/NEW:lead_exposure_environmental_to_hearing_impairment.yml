  node_id: hearing_impairment
  node_name: Hearing Impairment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Environmental lead exposure occurs through contaminated water, air, soil, or occupational settings'
- 'Step 2: Lead accumulates in the body and crosses into the cochlear system'
- 'Step 3: Lead causes oxidative stress and damage to the cochlear hair cells and auditory nerve'
- 'Step 4: Neurotoxic effects impair signal transmission along the auditory pathway'
- 'Step 5: Progressive damage results in measurable hearing loss'

description: Environmental lead pollution is associated with hearing loss through neurotoxic mechanisms
  affecting the auditory system. This meta-analysis synthesizes evidence from population-based studies
  examining lead exposure and hearing outcomes.

    stock, and occupational settings

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Lead exposure is structurally determined by housing quality (lead paint), water
    infrastructure (lead pipes), industrial zoning, and occupational safety regulations. Low-income communities
    and communities of color disproportionately bear the burden of lead exposure due to historical redlining,
    underinvestment in infrastructure, and proximity to industrial pollution sources. This mechanism traces
    hearing loss to policy failures in environmental protection and housing standards rather than individual
    behavior.
