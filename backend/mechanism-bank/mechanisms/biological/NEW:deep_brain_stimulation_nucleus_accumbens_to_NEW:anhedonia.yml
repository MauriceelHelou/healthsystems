direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nucleus accumbens is central to reward processing and pleasure experience'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol use dysregulates reward circuitry, contributing to anhedonia'
- 'Step 3: DBS normalizes activity patterns in the nucleus accumbens'
- 'Step 4: Improved reward circuit function reduces anhedonia symptoms'

description: Active DBS significantly reduced anhedonia compared to sham stimulation at 6 months. Anhedonia
  (inability to experience pleasure) is both a symptom of alcohol use disorder and a risk factor for relapse,
  making this a clinically important secondary outcome.

  description: Patients with higher baseline anhedonia showed better response to DBS, suggesting the intervention
    is particularly effective for those with reward circuit dysfunction
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Anhedonia in AUD patients reflects neurobiological adaptations to chronic alcohol
    exposure, but vulnerability to developing AUD in the first place is shaped by structural factors including
    trauma exposure, economic stress, and lack of alternative sources of reward and meaning (employment,
    social connection, recreational opportunities). Addressing anhedonia biologically does not address
    these upstream determinants.
