mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FASD causes neurodevelopmental impairments affecting executive function,
  impulse control, and judgment capacity'
- 'Step 2: These cognitive and behavioral deficits reduce ability to understand consequences
  of actions and comply with social norms'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with FASD experience difficulties in educational and social
  environments, leading to social marginalization'
- 'Step 4: Limited support systems and accommodation for FASD-related disabilities
  increase vulnerability to criminal justice involvement'
- 'Step 5: Neurocognitive impairments directly increase likelihood of engaging in
  criminal acts'
