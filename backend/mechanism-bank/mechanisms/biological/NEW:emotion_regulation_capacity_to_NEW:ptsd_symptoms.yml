mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals develop varying capacities for emotion regulation based on developmental experiences
  and structural supports'
- 'Step 2: Strong emotion regulation allows adaptive processing of traumatic memories and stress responses'
- 'Step 3: Effective emotion regulation reduces hyperarousal, intrusive symptoms, and avoidance behaviors
  characteristic of PTSD'
- 'Step 4: Better emotion regulation capacity is associated with lower PTSD symptom severity'

description: Emotion regulation is hypothesized as a key transdiagnostic mediator linking ACEs to both
  PTSD and SUD. However, only two of the 13 studies reported on emotion regulation outcomes, representing
  a critical gap in the evidence base.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Emotion regulation capacity develops through early relational experiences shaped
    by structural factors including family stability, economic security, and community support. The research
    gap on emotion regulation as a treatment target reflects how clinical research priorities may not
    align with mechanistic understanding of trauma pathways. This represents a structural limitation in
    evidence production.
