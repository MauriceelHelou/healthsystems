direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of alcohol use disorder may indicate genetic transmission
  of neurobiological vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 2: These genetic factors may influence neurodevelopmental processes affecting
  brain structure formation'
- 'Step 3: Altered neurodevelopmental trajectories result in differences in regional
  brain volumes, particularly in areas associated with reward processing and executive
  function'
- 'Step 4: These volumetric differences may represent endophenotypes for alcohol use
  disorder risk'

moderators:
- name: sex
  direction: unknown
  strength: weak
  description: Sex was examined as a potential moderator of family history effects
    on brain volumes, but no significant interactions were detected in the current
    study
- name: alcohol_use
  direction: unknown
  strength: weak
  description: Alcohol use was examined as an associated factor with volumetric outcomes,
    with groups matched on drinking variables to control for this potential confounder
