  exposure'

description: Patients with alcohol-related liver disease have elevated cardiovascular disease mortality
  due to the direct cardiotoxic effects of alcohol, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and arrhythmias,
  compounding the metabolic dysfunction from liver disease.

  description: Ongoing alcohol consumption after ALD diagnosis likely worsens cardiovascular outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cardiovascular mortality in ALD patients reflects cumulative harm from structural
    barriers to alcohol treatment, inadequate screening in primary care, and social determinants that
    drive problematic alcohol use. Low-income populations face dual barriers of alcohol availability and
    limited cardiology access.
