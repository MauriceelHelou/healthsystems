- 'Step 1: Acute pulmonary embolism causes occlusion of pulmonary vasculature'
- 'Step 2: Despite anticoagulant treatment, residual thrombus or organized fibrotic clots may persist
  in pulmonary vessels'
- 'Step 3: Persistent vascular obstruction leads to mismatched perfusion defects detectable on V/Q scan'
- 'Step 4: Impaired pulmonary blood flow contributes to chronic functional limitations including dyspnea
  and reduced exercise tolerance'
- 'Step 5: Patients experience post-PE syndrome manifestations including CTEPH, CTEPD, or post-PE functional
  impairment'

description: Presence of pulmonary perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction after acute pulmonary
  embolism is associated with a 2.15-fold increased odds of persistent symptoms during follow-up. Among
  patients with these defects, 48% remained symptomatic compared to 34% without such defects. However,
  the authors note that a significant proportion of patients with perfusion defects reported no limitations,
  indicating that direct causality remains unproven.

  description: Follow-up ranged from 2-72 months (median 6 months), which may influence persistence of
    defects and symptoms
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism is primarily biological rather than structural. However, healthcare
    access for adequate anticoagulation therapy, follow-up imaging (V/Q scan, CTPA), and specialist care
    for post-PE syndrome may vary by socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, and geographic location.
    Patients in healthcare deserts or those without specialist access may experience worse outcomes due
    to delayed diagnosis of CTEPH or CTEPD. The finding that causality is unproven suggests other factors
    (potentially including social determinants affecting recovery, rehabilitation access, and deconditioning)
    may contribute to persistent symptoms.
