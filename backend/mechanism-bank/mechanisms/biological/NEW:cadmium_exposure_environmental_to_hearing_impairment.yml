  node_id: hearing_impairment
  node_name: Hearing Impairment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cadmium enters the environment through industrial processes, mining, and contaminated food
  sources'
- 'Step 2: Human exposure occurs via inhalation, ingestion of contaminated food/water, or occupational
  contact'
- 'Step 3: Cadmium accumulates in tissues and generates oxidative stress in the cochlea'
- 'Step 4: Ototoxic effects damage sensory hair cells and cochlear structures'
- 'Step 5: Hearing function deteriorates resulting in measurable hearing loss'

description: Environmental cadmium pollution is associated with hearing loss through ototoxic mechanisms.
  The meta-analysis examines population-based evidence on cadmium exposure at various levels and hearing
  outcomes.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Cadmium exposure varies by proximity to industrial facilities, agricultural practices,
    and smoking prevalence in populations

  description: Tobacco smoke is a major source of cadmium exposure, compounding environmental sources
- name: occupational_exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Workers in battery manufacturing, mining, and metal processing have elevated exposure
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cadmium exposure is structurally determined by industrial regulation, occupational
    safety standards, agricultural practices, and environmental justice in siting of polluting facilities.
    Communities near industrial zones, often low-income and minority populations, face disproportionate
    exposure. Tobacco use, itself socially patterned by economic stress and targeted marketing, adds additional
    cadmium burden to disadvantaged populations.
