description: 'No significant difference between metformin and myo-inositol on testosterone levels (SMD=-0.01,
  95% CI: -0.24-0.21, p=.922), showing equivalent androgenic effects in PCOS treatment.'

    benefits regardless of which treatment they can access, reducing disparities related to prescription
    medication access.
