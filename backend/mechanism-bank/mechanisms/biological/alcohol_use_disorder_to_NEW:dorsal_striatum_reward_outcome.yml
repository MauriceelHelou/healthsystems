direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to neuroadaptations in striatal circuits'
- 'Step 2: The dorsal striatum is critical for processing reward outcomes and habit formation'
- 'Step 3: Decreased dorsal striatum activation during reward outcome reflects impaired ability to process
  and learn from non-drug rewards'
- 'Step 4: This may shift behavior toward habitual alcohol use rather than goal-directed pursuit of natural
  rewards'

description: During the reward outcome stage, AUD patients exhibit reduced activation in the dorsal striatum,
  suggesting impaired outcome processing that may undermine reward-based learning for non-drug rewards.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Dorsal striatum dysfunction indicates a shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior
    patterns, a neurobiological consequence of chronic alcohol exposure rather than a moral failing.
