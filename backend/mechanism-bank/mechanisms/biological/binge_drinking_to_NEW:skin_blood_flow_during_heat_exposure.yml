direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption induces peripheral vasodilation through direct effects on vascular smooth
  muscle'
- 'Step 2: Vasodilation increases cutaneous blood flow to skin surface'
- 'Step 3: Increased skin blood flow enhances convective heat transfer from core to periphery'
- 'Step 4: This physiological response may facilitate heat dissipation during heat stress'

description: Alcohol consumption increased skin blood flow in the single study that measured this outcome,
  suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol may enhance heat dissipation through peripheral vasodilation
  during heat exposure.

  equity_implications: This biological mechanism has implications for understanding heat vulnerability
    in populations with high alcohol consumption. However, enhanced skin blood flow may not translate
    to protective effects in populations with compromised cardiovascular function or in extreme heat conditions.
    Structural factors determining alcohol availability and consumption patterns in heat-vulnerable communities
    warrant consideration.
