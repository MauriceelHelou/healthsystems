description: Systematic review finding that 75% of MR studies report null associations between genetically
  predicted alcohol consumption and diabetes. This challenges observational data suggesting protective
  effects of moderate drinking on diabetes risk.

  description: Only 71% of studies performed full instrumental variable analysis; incomplete analysis

  equity_implications: The null findings have implications for public health messaging and alcohol policy.
    If moderate drinking does not causally protect against diabetes, policies that restrict alcohol availability
    and marketing would not have unintended negative health consequences. Structural determinants of diabetes
    (food environment, economic stress, healthcare access) remain primary targets for intervention.
