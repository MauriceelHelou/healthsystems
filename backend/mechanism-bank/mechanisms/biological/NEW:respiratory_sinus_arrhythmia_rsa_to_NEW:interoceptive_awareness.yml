direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: RSA reflects vagal tone and parasympathetic nervous system regulation capacity'
- 'Step 2: Higher vagal tone supports ability to perceive and interpret internal bodily signals'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced interoceptive awareness enables recognition of physiological states including stress
  and craving'
- 'Step 4: This awareness is foundational for emotion regulation capacity relevant to SUD recovery'

description: This study provides first evidence that RSA serves as a physiological index of interoceptive
  awareness among women in SUD treatment. RSA was significantly correlated with interoceptive awareness
  after controlling for age and BMI, but not with measures of symptomatic distress or mindfulness.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the biological pathways underlying emotion regulation
    capacity in SUD treatment populations. The study sample demonstrates extensive trauma histories and
    low SES, indicating structural factors (poverty, trauma exposure) shape the population requiring treatment.
    The finding supports need for targeted mind-body interventions that address physiological regulation
    capacity, suggesting treatment approaches should account for autonomic nervous system functioning
    rather than solely relying on cognitive-behavioral approaches.
