description: The abstract identifies risky driving as a daily functional consequence of attention deficits
  in older adults with MCI. Cognitive training that improves attention may reduce driving-related crash
  risk.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Vehicle dependency in car-centric communities with limited public transit forces
    older adults with MCI to continue driving despite cognitive deficits. Structural transportation alternatives
    would reduce exposure to this risk. Access to cognitive screening and training programs is also structurally
    determined.
