mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption causes chronic liver damage and impaired hepatic function'
- 'Step 2: Reduced hepatic synthetic function compromises production of acute phase reactants and coagulation
  factors'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiovascular compromise reduce physiological reserve'
- 'Step 4: Diminished organ function reserves lead to rapid clinical deterioration requiring intensive
  care'

description: Individuals with drinking history had 32% higher risk of ICU admission for COVID-19. This
  reflects alcohol's cumulative damage to multiple organ systems that reduces physiological reserve needed
  to survive severe infection. American populations showed 51% increased risk of ICU admission among drinkers.

  description: Brown (non-white) population showed RR=1.58 for severe COVID-19, suggesting potential racial/ethnic
    disparities in alcohol-COVID interaction
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: ICU admission patterns reflect intersection of alcohol-related health vulnerability
    and healthcare system access. Communities with higher rates of alcohol use disorders due to structural
    factors (economic deprivation, targeted marketing, limited treatment access) faced compounded risk
    during the pandemic. The racial/ethnic variation (Brown drinkers RR=1.58) suggests structural racism
    may create differential vulnerability through both increased alcohol exposure and reduced healthcare
    access.
