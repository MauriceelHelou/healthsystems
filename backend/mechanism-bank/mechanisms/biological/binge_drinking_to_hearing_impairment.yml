- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption leads to direct ototoxic effects on cochlear hair cells and auditory nerve
  fibers'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes oxidative stress and inflammatory damage to auditory structures'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-induced changes in central auditory processing pathways impair sound interpretation'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative damage to auditory system results in measurable hearing loss'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 18 observational studies (9 cross-sectional, 5 case-control, 4 cohort)
  with 27,849 participants found that alcohol drinkers have 22% higher odds of hearing loss compared to
  non-drinkers (OR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09-1.35). The findings suggest that alcohol consumption is a modifiable
  risk factor for hearing loss, with implications for prevention strategies.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on individual alcohol consumption and biological pathways,
    structural factors influence alcohol use patterns including alcohol outlet density, marketing exposure,
    socioeconomic conditions, and occupational stress leading to alcohol use. The finding that drinking
    limitations may prevent hearing loss points to potential policy interventions (alcohol pricing, availability
    restrictions) rather than individual blame. Populations with higher structural exposure to alcohol
    (e.g., those in areas with high alcohol outlet density, fewer recreational alternatives, or higher
    occupational stress) may face compounded risk for hearing loss.
