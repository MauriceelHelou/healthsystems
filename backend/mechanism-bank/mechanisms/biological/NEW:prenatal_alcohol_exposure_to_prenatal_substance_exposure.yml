description: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a specific form of prenatal substance exposure with documented
  teratogenic effects, including epigenetic alterations that affect HPA axis development.

  description: Lower SES associated with reduced access to prenatal care and substance use treatment,
    potentially increasing exposure severity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism connects maternal alcohol use to infant health outcomes. Structural
    factors including alcohol marketing, pricing policies, treatment access, and social determinants of
    maternal health all influence rates of prenatal alcohol exposure at the population level.
