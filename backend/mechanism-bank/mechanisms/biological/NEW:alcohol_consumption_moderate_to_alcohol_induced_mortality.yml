mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption contributes to cumulative hepatotoxic effects over time'
- 'Step 2: Even low-level chronic exposure contributes to cardiomyopathy and cancer risk'
- 'Step 3: Increased risk of accidents and acute alcohol-related events'
- 'Step 4: Elevated mortality risk from 100% alcohol-attributable causes'

description: At moderate consumption of 20g/day (about one large beer), the risk of dying from alcohol
  use disorder is approximately double that of current non-drinkers, indicating that mortality risk elevation
  begins at commonly consumed levels.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Population-level mortality from even moderate consumption represents a significant
    public health burden. Structural interventions including alcohol pricing policies, outlet density
    restrictions, and marketing limitations can reduce population consumption and associated mortality.
    The framing of 'moderate' drinking as safe is shaped by industry influence on research and policy.
