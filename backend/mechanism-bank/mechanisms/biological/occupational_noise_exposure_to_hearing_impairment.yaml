direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prolonged occupational noise exposure delivers high-intensity sound energy
  to the cochlea'
- 'Step 2: Excessive acoustic energy causes mechanical damage to hair cells in the
  organ of Corti'
- 'Step 3: Sustained exposure leads to oxidative stress and metabolic exhaustion in
  cochlear structures'
- 'Step 4: Progressive damage results in noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL), affecting
  both speech and high frequencies'

description: Occupational noise exposure is strongly associated with noise-induced
  hearing loss, with the umbrella review finding that workers exposed to occupational
  noise had 6.68 times higher risk of speech frequency hearing loss and 4.46 times
  higher risk of high-frequency hearing loss compared to unexposed individuals. This
  represents the largest risk increment among all noise exposure sources examined.
