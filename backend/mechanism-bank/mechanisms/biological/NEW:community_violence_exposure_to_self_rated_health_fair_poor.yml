mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community violence exposure activates chronic stress response systems'
- 'Step 2: Dysregulation of primary allostatic load mediators (cortisol, catecholamines, DHEA)'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated physiological wear leads to early symptoms of chronic disease'
- 'Step 4: Myriad adverse health outcomes manifest, reducing overall health status'
- 'Step 5: Individuals report poorer subjective health assessments'

description: Community violence exposure increases risk for poor health outcomes through the allostatic
  load pathway, whereby chronic stress leads to disrupted physiological functioning across multiple systems.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Geographic concentration of community violence in structurally disadvantaged areas
    creates spatial health disparities
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates biological embedding of structural inequity. Communities
    experiencing violence also face multiple compounding structural disadvantages (poverty, lack of resources,
    environmental hazards) that compound health risks. The pathway from violence to poor health reflects
    cumulative disadvantage rather than individual vulnerability.
