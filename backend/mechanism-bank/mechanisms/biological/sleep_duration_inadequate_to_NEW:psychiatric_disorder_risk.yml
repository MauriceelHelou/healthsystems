category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended wakefulness, shortened sleep duration, and nighttime awakening disrupt emotional processing'
- 'Step 2: Multiple emotional domains affected: reduced positive affect, increased anxiety, blunted reactivity'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative emotional dysfunction undermines resilience and coping capacity'
- 'Step 4: Persistent sleep-related emotional dysfunction increases risk for development of psychiatric
  disorders'

description: This comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrates that sleep loss through multiple mechanisms
  (extended wakefulness, shortened duration, nighttime awakening) undermines emotional functioning and
  increases risk for psychiatric disorders. The effects span multiple emotional domains including positive
  affect, anxiety, and emotional reactivity.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Psychiatric risk from sleep loss represents a mechanism through which structural
    inequities (precarious employment, housing instability, lack of paid leave, caregiving burdens) translate
    into mental health disparities. Those facing multiple structural barriers experience compounding risk
    through both direct stressors and sleep-mediated emotional dysfunction. Addressing upstream structural
    factors is essential for reducing population-level psychiatric burden.
