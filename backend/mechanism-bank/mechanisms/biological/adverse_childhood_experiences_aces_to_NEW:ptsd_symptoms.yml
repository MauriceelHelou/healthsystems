mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) creates early-life trauma and toxic stress'
- 'Step 2: Unresolved trauma disrupts neurobiological stress response systems and emotional regulation
  capacity'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulated emotion processing leads to persistent hyperarousal, intrusive memories, and avoidance
  behaviors'
- 'Step 4: These neurobiological and psychological changes manifest as chronic PTSD symptoms in adulthood'

  to unresolved early trauma and disrupted stress response systems. The review found small to medium positive
  effect sizes for psychological interventions on PTSD outcomes in this population.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: ACEs represent structural failures in child protection, family support systems,
    and community safety. The long-term health effects reflect how childhood adversity becomes biologically
    embedded through toxic stress, creating lasting health inequities. Treatment access and effectiveness
    are themselves shaped by structural factors including healthcare availability and intervention design.
