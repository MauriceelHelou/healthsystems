description: Causal inference using genetic variants identifies n-3 fatty acids as playing a causal role
  in the metabolite-to-type 2 diabetes pathway, suggesting protective effects of adequate omega-3 fatty
  acid metabolism against diabetes development.

  sample_size: 3000
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: N-3 fatty acid status is heavily influenced by dietary access to fish, seafood,
    and fortified foods. Food deserts, economic constraints, and geographic distance from fresh seafood
    sources create structural barriers to adequate n-3 fatty acid intake. Policies improving affordable
    access to omega-3 rich foods could address this causal pathway.
