mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced neuroadaptations affect executive control network connectivity'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced connectivity develops between executive control network and amygdala'
- 'Step 3: This dysregulation impairs top-down emotional regulation capacity'
- 'Step 4: Craving states become more difficult to manage through cognitive control'
- 'Step 5: Diminished ability to regulate craving leads to treatment non-completion'

description: Treatment non-completers demonstrate enhanced functional connectivity between executive control
  network and amygdala compared to completers. This pattern correlates with craving intensity, suggesting
  impaired executive regulation of emotional/motivational responses contributes to relapse vulnerability.

  equity_implications: Executive control network dysfunction represents a neurobiological consequence
    of alcohol use disorder that affects treatment success. This finding highlights the need for treatment
    programs to address these neural vulnerabilities rather than attributing treatment failure to lack
    of willpower or motivation.
