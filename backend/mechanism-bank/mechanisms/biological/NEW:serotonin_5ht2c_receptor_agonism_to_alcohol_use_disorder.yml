mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Full agonism or positive allosteric modulation of serotonin 5-HT2C receptors is administered'
- 'Step 2: 5-HT2C receptor activation modulates mesolimbic dopamine signaling involved in reward processing'
- 'Step 3: Reduced dopaminergic activity in reward circuits decreases alcohol-seeking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Diminished reinforcing effects of alcohol lead to reduced consumption and craving'
- 'Step 5: Overall reduction in alcohol misuse behaviors and AUD symptom severity'

description: This study investigates the therapeutic potential of targeting the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor
  system for alcohol use disorder treatment. The mechanism involves pharmacological modulation of serotonergic
  pathways that influence reward processing and alcohol-seeking behavior.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on biological/pharmacological intervention, it represents
    a structural approach to AUD treatment by developing novel pharmacotherapies that address neurobiological
    pathways. This supports healthcare system capacity to treat AUD rather than relying solely on behavioral
    interventions. From an equity perspective, expanding pharmacotherapy options for AUD could improve
    treatment access for populations who face barriers to behavioral health services. However, implementation
    requires addressing structural barriers to medication access including insurance coverage, prescriber
    availability, and pharmaceutical costs.
