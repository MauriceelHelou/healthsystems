- 'Step 1: White matter tracts in anterior corpus callosum and anterior corona radiata provide structural
  scaffolding for functional networks'
- 'Step 2: Intact white matter enables efficient communication between distributed brain regions'
- 'Step 3: Higher structural integrity supports stronger resting-state functional connectivity in occipital-frontal-cerebellar
  regions'
- 'Step 4: These connected regions form networks known to be involved in inhibitory control and executive
  function'

description: Higher fractional anisotropy values in anterior corpus callosum and bilateral anterior corona
  radiata predict stronger functional connectivity in occipital-frontal-cerebellar regions involved in
  inhibitory control. This demonstrates structure-function relationships in the brain relevant to substance
  use vulnerability.

  equity_implications: This structure-function relationship in the brain can be affected by upstream structural
    determinants including environmental exposures, chronic stress, nutritional deficits, and substance-related
    neurotoxicity. Disparities in these exposures by race, class, and geography create differential vulnerability
    to disrupted brain connectivity and subsequent substance use risk.
