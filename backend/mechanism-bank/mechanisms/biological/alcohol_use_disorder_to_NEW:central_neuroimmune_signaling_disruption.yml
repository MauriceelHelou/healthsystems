direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term heavy alcohol consumption establishes patterns of repeated neurotoxic exposure'
- 'Step 2: Multiple diagnostic modalities (CSF, PET, postmortem) detect consistent evidence of altered
  neuroimmune profiles'
- 'Step 3: CSF studies may reveal changes in cytokine and chemokine levels indicating blood-brain barrier
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: PET imaging reveals in-vivo alterations in microglial activity markers'
- 'Step 5: Convergent evidence across modalities indicates systemic disruption of central nervous system
  immune homeostasis'

description: This meta-analysis synthesizes evidence across multiple diagnostic modalities (CSF, PET neuroimaging,
  and postmortem studies) to demonstrate that alcohol use disorder is associated with altered central
  neuroimmune signaling. The convergence of findings across different measurement approaches provides
  robust evidence that heavy long-term alcohol consumption fundamentally impacts the brain's immune profile,
  despite significant heterogeneity within study types.

  description: Significant heterogeneity in postmortem studies (Q(14)=62.02, p<0.001) indicates variability
    in effect sizes across studies, potentially due to differences in AUD severity, duration, or comorbidities

  description: Convergent evidence across CSF, PET, and postmortem modalities strengthens overall conclusion
    despite within-modality heterogeneity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents the biological endpoint of structural factors that shape
    alcohol use patterns. Policies around alcohol availability, taxation, advertising restrictions, minimum
    drinking age enforcement, and treatment system capacity all influence population-level AUD prevalence.
    The neuroinflammatory consequences documented here represent the embodiment of these policy environments
    in brain tissue. Health equity considerations are critical as communities with fewer resources for
    prevention and treatment, and higher exposure to alcohol retail concentration, may bear disproportionate
    burden of these neurological consequences. Structural interventions targeting alcohol policy reform
    could prevent these brain changes at the population level.
