direction: 'null'
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants associated with glucocorticoid use were used as instrumental
  variables to assess causal relationship'
- 'Step 2: Mendelian randomization analysis tested whether genetically predicted glucocorticoid
  use affects pancreatitis risk through biological pathways'
- 'Step 3: Multiple MR methods (IVW, MR-Egger, weighted median) consistently found
  no causal effect across European, East Asian, and Finnish populations'
- 'Step 4: Analysis adjusted for confounders including alcohol consumption, BMI, cholelithiasis,
  and C-reactive protein levels'
