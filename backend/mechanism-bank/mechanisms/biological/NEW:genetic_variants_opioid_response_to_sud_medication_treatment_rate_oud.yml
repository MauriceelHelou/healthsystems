direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants in opioid-related pathways influence individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
  responses to buprenorphine'
- 'Step 2: These variants affect mu-opioid receptor binding affinity and downstream signaling cascades'
- 'Step 3: Differential biological responses manifest as variable treatment outcomes measured by urine
  drug screen results'
- 'Step 4: Identification of predictive genetic markers could enable personalized treatment approaches
  to improve response rates'

  equity_implications: 'While this study focuses on biological/genetic factors, structural implications
    include: (1) inequitable access to precision medicine approaches across populations, (2) historical
    underrepresentation of non-European ancestries in pharmacogenomic research contributing to treatment
    disparities, (3) the need for equitable research inclusion to ensure genetic findings benefit all
    populations. The multi-ancestry design represents a structural improvement in research equity.'
