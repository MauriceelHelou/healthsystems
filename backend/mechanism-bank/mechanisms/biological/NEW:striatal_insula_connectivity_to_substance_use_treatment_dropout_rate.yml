mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure induces neuroadaptations in mesocorticolimbic terminal regions'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced resting-state functional connectivity develops between striatum and insula'
- 'Step 3: This enhanced connectivity amplifies interoceptive signaling related to craving states'
- 'Step 4: Heightened craving intensity drives pathological drug-seeking behavior'
- 'Step 5: Individuals with enhanced striatal-insula connectivity are more likely to drop out of treatment'

description: Individuals with alcohol use disorder who fail to complete treatment show enhanced functional
  connectivity between striatum and insula compared to treatment completers. This connectivity pattern
  is positively associated with craving intensity in non-completers, suggesting a neural mechanism underlying
  treatment dropout.

  description: Non-completers exhibited positive associations between craving intensity and striatum-insula
    RSFC, indicating craving moderates the relationship between neural connectivity and treatment outcomes

  equity_implications: This biological mechanism represents the neurological consequences of alcohol exposure
    rather than individual choice. The brain changes that develop with AUD are not under voluntary control
    and represent structural changes that treatment programs must accommodate. Understanding these neural
    signatures could inform targeted interventions and reduce stigma by showing relapse vulnerability
    has biological underpinnings.
