description: Genetic mediation models demonstrate that alcohol consumption mediates the association between
  sensation seeking genetic liability and AUD, suggesting links between sensation seeking and AUD primarily
  manifest through increased consumption rather than direct effects on problems and consequences.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mediation pathway suggests that preventing elevated consumption among those
    with sensation-seeking tendencies could interrupt progression to AUD. Structural policies limiting
    alcohol availability, pricing interventions, and marketing restrictions may be particularly protective
    for genetically vulnerable populations. This shifts focus from blaming individuals with sensation-seeking
    traits to creating environments that protect vulnerable populations.
