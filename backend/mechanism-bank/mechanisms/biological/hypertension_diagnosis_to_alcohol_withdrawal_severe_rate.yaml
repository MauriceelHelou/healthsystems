direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption leads to compensatory cardiovascular
  adaptations, including elevated baseline blood pressure through increased sympathetic
  nervous system activity and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  axis'
- 'Step 2: During alcohol withdrawal, the sudden removal of alcohol''s CNS depressant
  effects causes sympathetic hyperactivity, manifesting as elevated blood pressure
  (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg) which serves as a marker of withdrawal severity'
- 'Step 3: Elevated baseline systolic blood pressure at hospital admission indicates
  greater physiological dependence and sympathetic nervous system dysregulation, predicting
  higher likelihood of progression to severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome including
  delirium tremens and withdrawal seizures'

description: Baseline systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher is associated
  with increased likelihood of developing severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS).
  This systematic review of 14 studies with 71,295 patients found that elevated blood
  pressure at admission, reflecting underlying sympathetic hyperactivity and cardiovascular
  stress, predicts progression to severe withdrawal outcomes including delirium tremens
  and seizures.
