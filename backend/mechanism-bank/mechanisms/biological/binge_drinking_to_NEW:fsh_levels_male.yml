direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate to high alcohol consumption affects the hypothalamic-pituitary axis'
- 'Step 2: Altered gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion patterns emerge'
- 'Step 3: FSH secretion from the anterior pituitary is modestly reduced'
- 'Step 4: This may contribute to subtle effects on spermatogenesis'

description: 'Subgroup analysis indicated a small but statistically significant difference in FSH levels
  between moderate/high alcohol consumption compared to low consumption groups. The overall pooled analysis
  for FSH showed no significant difference (SMD -0.00, 95% CI: -0.099 to 0.099), but consumption level
  moderated this relationship.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: FSH is critical for male reproductive health and spermatogenesis. Structural factors
    that promote higher alcohol consumption, including alcohol outlet density in disadvantaged neighborhoods,
    targeted marketing to certain populations, and lack of accessible treatment services, may contribute
    to population-level reproductive health disparities.
