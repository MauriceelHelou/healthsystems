- 'Step 1: Healthcare-delivered brief interventions screen for and address hazardous alcohol use'

  equity_implications: Alcohol-related consequences encompass social, legal, occupational, and health
    domains that are often unequally distributed by socioeconomic status. The effectiveness of brief interventions
    in reducing these consequences suggests that healthcare system investments in screening and brief
    intervention capacity can contribute to reducing the broader social burden of alcohol use disorders.
