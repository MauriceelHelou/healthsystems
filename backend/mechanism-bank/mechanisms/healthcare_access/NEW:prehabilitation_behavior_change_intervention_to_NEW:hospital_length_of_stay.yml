mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems implement preoperative behavior change interventions targeting smoking,
  alcohol, physical activity, or diet'
- 'Step 2: Patients modify health risk behaviors prior to surgery, improving physiological readiness'
- 'Step 3: Improved preoperative health status reduces surgical complications and recovery time'
- 'Step 4: Reduced complications translate to shorter hospital stays'

description: Behavioral prehabilitation interventions delivered before surgery reduce hospital length
  of stay by an average of 1.5 days compared to usual care, with stronger effects observed in lung cancer

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism operates at the healthcare system level, representing how institutional
    practices around surgical care can improve outcomes. Access to prehabilitation programs may be inequitably
    distributed, potentially favoring patients with resources, flexible schedules, and healthcare literacy.
    No trials examined effects by equality measures, representing a significant gap in understanding health
    equity implications.
