- 'Step 1: Health systems implement universal alcohol screening protocols in primary care settings'
- 'Step 2: Screening identifies patients who consume alcohol and could become pregnant'
- 'Step 3: Brief behavioral interventions are delivered to at-risk patients'
- 'Step 4: Patients receive education and counseling about alcohol risks during potential pregnancy'
- 'Step 5: Reduced alcohol consumption among reproductive-age patients decreases alcohol-exposed pregnancy
  risk'

description: Implementation of alcohol screening and brief intervention (alcohol SBI) in primary care
  settings reduces alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk by systematically identifying and counseling reproductive-age
  patients who consume alcohol. The implementation success depends on health system adaptability and organizational
  structure.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to alcohol SBI delivery including
    workflow design, EHR infrastructure, and organizational management. Rather than placing blame on individuals
    for alcohol consumption, it focuses on healthcare system capacity to deliver evidence-based prevention
    services. Equity implications include that decentralized systems may have more barriers to implementation,
    potentially creating geographic disparities in access to screening services.
