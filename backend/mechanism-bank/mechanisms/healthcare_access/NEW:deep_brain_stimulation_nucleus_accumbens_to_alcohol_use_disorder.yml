  center'
- 'Step 2: Electrical stimulation modulates dopaminergic reward circuitry associated with addiction'
- 'Step 3: Altered neural activity in reward pathways reduces alcohol craving and anhedonia'
- 'Step 4: Reduced craving leads to higher proportion of abstinent days and improved treatment outcomes'

description: Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens in patients with treatment-resistant alcohol
  use disorder resulted in significantly higher proportion of abstinent days and lower alcohol craving
  compared to sham stimulation in a double-blind RCT. The primary outcome of continuous abstinence did
  not reach statistical significance, likely due to small sample size (n=12), but secondary outcomes showed
  beneficial effects.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a biomedical intervention for individuals who have failed
    conventional treatments. While the intervention itself is individual-level, the existence of 'treatment-resistant'
    AUD reflects structural failures in addiction treatment systems, including inadequate access to comprehensive
    care, insufficient treatment duration, and healthcare systems not designed around chronic disease
    management for addiction. The high-tech nature of DBS also raises equity concerns regarding access
    - such interventions may only be available in well-resourced academic medical centers, potentially
    exacerbating disparities in addiction treatment outcomes.
