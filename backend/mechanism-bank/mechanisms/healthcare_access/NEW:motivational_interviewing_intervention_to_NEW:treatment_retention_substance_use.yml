- 'Step 1: MI creates non-judgmental, compassionate therapeutic environment'

- 'Step 3: Exploration of personal motivations increases investment in treatment process'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced engagement theoretically leads to improved treatment retention'

description: The review examined retention in treatment as a primary outcome, but found it unclear whether
  MI has an effect on treatment retention. Despite theoretical mechanisms suggesting MI should improve
  engagement and retention, the evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 22776
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects examined across diverse treatment settings including inpatient and outpatient
    clinics
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment retention is heavily influenced by structural factors beyond the intervention
    itself, including treatment accessibility, transportation, work schedule flexibility, childcare availability,
    and insurance coverage continuity. These structural barriers may overwhelm any individual-level benefits
    from MI.
