mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lay health workers or volunteers establish community-based blood pressure screening sites in
  accessible locations'
- 'Step 2: Programs provide regular blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular health education to community
  members'
- 'Step 3: Repeated visits allow tracking of blood pressure changes over time and reinforce health awareness'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness and monitoring leads to behavior modification and improved healthcare-seeking
  for hypertension management'
- 'Step 5: Sustained engagement with programs contributes to blood pressure reduction among participants'

description: Community-based blood pressure screening and cardiovascular awareness programs delivered
  by lay health workers or volunteers may contribute to blood pressure reduction among participants through
  regular monitoring and health education. These programs address healthcare access gaps created by global
  healthcare worker shortages.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The paper notes significant geographic variation in healthcare access, with particular
    concern for urban areas in developing nations experiencing rapid population growth and healthcare
    system strain. Access to antihypertensive medications and trained personnel varies substantially between
    countries.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to healthcare access, particularly
    the global shortage of healthcare professionals and inequitable distribution of health resources.
    The protocol explicitly focuses on how lay health worker programs can fill gaps in healthcare systems,
    particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas of developing nations where cardiovascular disease burden
    is increasing but healthcare infrastructure is lacking. The approach recognizes that individual hypertension
    management is constrained by structural factors including medication access, trained personnel availability,
    and healthcare system capacity.
