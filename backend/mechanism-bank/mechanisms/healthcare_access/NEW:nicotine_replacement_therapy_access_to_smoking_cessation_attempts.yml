mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) provides pharmacological support for cessation'
- 'Step 2: NRT reduces physiological withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Reduced withdrawal facilitates sustained abstinence attempts'
- 'Step 4: Long-term smoking cessation achieved (baseline comparator)'

description: NRT serves as established comparator for smoking cessation. While effective, nicotine e-cigarettes
  demonstrate 59% higher quit rates, suggesting that alternative harm reduction strategies may improve
  population-level cessation outcomes.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 29044
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: NRT access is determined by healthcare coverage, pharmacy density, cost structures,
    and clinical practice guidelines. Structural barriers to NRT may disproportionately affect uninsured
    and underinsured populations. Policy decisions about OTC availability and insurance coverage shape
    population access to this intervention.
