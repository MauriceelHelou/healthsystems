mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions provide accessible, scalable delivery of evidence-based therapeutic content
  for depression'
- 'Step 2: Integrated treatment addresses both depression and alcohol use simultaneously, targeting bidirectional
  reinforcement'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive-behavioral and motivational components reduce depressive symptom severity'
- 'Step 4: Reduced depression symptoms decrease reliance on alcohol as self-medication'

  co-occurring conditions.

  description: Effect on depressive symptoms significant at 3-month follow-up (g=0.34, p=0.02) but non-significant
    at 6-month follow-up (g=0.29, p=0.15), suggesting attenuation over time
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Digital interventions address structural barriers to mental health care access
    including geographic isolation, cost, stigma, and limited provider availability. This approach can
    reduce healthcare access disparities for populations unable to access traditional in-person treatment.
    The focus on integrated treatment acknowledges the structural reality that co-occurring conditions
    require coordinated care often unavailable in fragmented healthcare systems.
