- 'Step 1: Usual care represents standard treatment without specific evidence-based psychosocial intervention'
- 'Step 2: May include general medical advice, referral, or minimal intervention'
- 'Step 3: Lacks structured therapeutic components targeting motivation and coping skills'
- 'Step 4: Serves as comparison condition demonstrating relative effectiveness of specialized psychosocial
  interventions'

description: Usual care served as the comparator condition in the network meta-analysis, with the most
  intensive combined intervention (MI-CBT/Mult/F2F) demonstrating a mean difference of -4.98 AUDIT points
  compared to usual care. This highlights the potential for improvement over standard practice through
  implementation of evidence-based psychosocial interventions.

  equity_implications: The effectiveness gap between usual care and evidence-based psychosocial interventions
    represents a structural treatment gap. Many individuals with harmful alcohol use receive only usual
    care due to healthcare system barriers including limited specialty behavioral health services, inadequate
    insurance coverage for intensive treatment, and shortage of trained providers. Addressing this structural
    treatment gap requires healthcare policy changes, workforce development, and resource allocation to
    make evidence-based intensive interventions accessible to all populations.
