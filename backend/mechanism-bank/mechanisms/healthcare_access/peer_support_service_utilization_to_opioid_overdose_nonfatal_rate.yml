mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peer recovery support specialists (PRSS) engage patients presenting at emergency departments
  for opioid-related reasons'
- 'Step 2: PRSS provide harm reduction education and naloxone distribution'
- 'Step 3: PRSS facilitate treatment linkage and recovery coaching'
- 'Step 4: Increased treatment engagement and harm reduction practices theoretically reduce subsequent
  overdose events'

description: This pragmatic randomized trial tested whether an ED-initiated peer recovery support specialist
  intervention (POINT) could reduce recurrent overdose and increase OUD treatment linkage. Results showed
  no significant differences between POINT and standard care on any outcomes measured, including overdose-related
  ED re-presentation at 3, 6, and 12 months. The study was underpowered but suggests PRSS services may
  not provide benefit over standard care in ED settings.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 243
moderators:
- name: treatment_readiness
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Participants presenting for overdose had significantly lower readiness to begin treatment
    (3.5 vs 4.2, P<.01) compared to those presenting for other opioid-related issues, suggesting treatment
    motivation moderates intervention effectiveness
- name: reason_for_ed_presentation
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Overdose patients showed lower treatment readiness scores, suggesting the intervention
    may be less effective for acute overdose presentations versus other opioid-related ED visits
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This study examines a structural healthcare intervention (peer support services
    in ED settings) rather than individual-level factors. The null findings highlight systemic challenges
    in OUD treatment linkage that may require multimodal interventions addressing broader structural barriers.
    The finding that overdose patients have lower treatment readiness suggests timing of intervention
    relative to crisis state matters. Structural factors like treatment accessibility, insurance coverage
    (Medicaid enrollment was measured), and healthcare system capacity may moderate effectiveness. The
    study appropriately focuses on system-level intervention rather than blaming individuals for addiction.
