mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital inclusion (broadband access, device ownership, digital literacy) enables engagement
  with digital health tools'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with digital access can utilize telehealth, mental health apps, and online symptom
  monitoring'
- 'Step 3: Digital exclusion creates structural barrier preventing uptake of digital mental health services'
- 'Step 4: Populations with higher digital inclusion have greater access to emerging digital mental health
  care modalities'

description: Digital exclusion serves as a structural barrier to accessing digital mental health interventions,
  meaning populations without adequate broadband, devices, or digital literacy cannot benefit from telehealth,
  apps, and other digital mental health modalities.

  variation_notes: Digital exclusion patterns vary significantly by geography, with implications for UAE-specific
    implementation noted

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Digital exclusion is a structural determinant that intersects with existing health
    inequities. Low-income populations, rural communities, elderly individuals, and those with disabilities
    face disproportionate digital exclusion. Policy responses must address infrastructure investment,
    affordability programs, and digital literacy training to prevent digital mental health expansion from
    widening health disparities.
