mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Provision of transitional housing with integrated harm reduction services removes housing instability
  barrier to treatment engagement'
- 'Step 2: Embedded harm reduction services (syringe exchange, drug checking) establish trust and reduce
  barriers to healthcare contact'
- 'Step 3: Stable housing environment enables consistent follow-up and linkage to substance use disorder
  treatment services'
- 'Step 4: On-site services facilitate warm handoffs to medication-assisted treatment and other treatment
  modalities'

description: Harm reduction housing that integrates services like syringe exchange within transitional
  housing environments may facilitate treatment uptake among people who are unhoused and use drugs by
  reducing barriers and establishing trusted service connections.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to treatment including homelessness,
    lack of service access, and criminalization of substance use. The study explicitly examines how housing
    as a structural intervention affects health outcomes, avoiding individual blame for substance use
    disorder.
