mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permanent Supportive Housing (Housing First) provides stable housing without
  requiring ''housing readiness'' prerequisites such as sobriety or psychiatric treatment
  compliance'
- 'Step 2: Stable housing reduces exposure to environmental health hazards, violence,
  and extreme weather conditions associated with street homelessness'
- 'Step 3: Housing stability facilitates consistent access to integrated health, mental
  health, and substance use support services'
- 'Step 4: Improved healthcare access leads to better management of chronic conditions
  (e.g., HIV viral load reduced by 22%, depression reduced by 13%)'
- 'Step 5: Reduced emergency department use (41% reduction) and hospitalization (36%
  reduction) indicates transition from crisis care to preventive care'
- 'Step 6: Combined improvements in physical health, mental health, and reduced crisis
  utilization result in decreased mortality (37% reduction observed in HIV population)'

description: Permanent Supportive Housing using a Housing First approach reduces all-cause
  mortality by providing stable housing without treatment prerequisites, enabling
  consistent healthcare access, reducing emergency healthcare utilization, and improving
  management of chronic conditions. A systematic review of 26 studies found 37% mortality
  reduction among HIV-positive homeless individuals, with parallel improvements in
  viral load (22% reduction), depression (13% reduction), emergency department use
  (41% reduction), and hospitalization (36% reduction).
