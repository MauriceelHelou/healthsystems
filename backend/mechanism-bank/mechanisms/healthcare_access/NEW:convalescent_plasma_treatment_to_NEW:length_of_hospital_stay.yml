- 'Step 1: Convalescent plasma infusion introduces donor antibodies'
- 'Step 2: Theoretical acceleration of viral clearance and immune response'
- 'Step 3: Faster recovery could reduce hospitalization duration'
- 'Step 4: Meta-analysis found non-significant effect on length of stay'
- 'Step 5: Extremely wide confidence intervals indicate high uncertainty'

description: The summary hazard ratio for length of hospital stay was 1.17 (95% CI 0.07-20.34), indicating
  no significant difference between convalescent plasma and control groups. The extremely wide confidence
  interval reflects substantial imprecision and low certainty of evidence.

  description: Limited data available on length of hospital stay outcome, contributing to extreme imprecision
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Hospital length of stay has important structural implications for healthcare system
    capacity and resource allocation. Extended hospitalizations during pandemic surges exacerbated bed
    shortages and affected care quality for all patients, with disproportionate impacts on under-resourced
    healthcare systems serving marginalized communities.
