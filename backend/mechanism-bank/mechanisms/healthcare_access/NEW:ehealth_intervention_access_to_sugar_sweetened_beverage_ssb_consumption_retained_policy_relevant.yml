direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low SES and geographically remote adolescents have limited access to nutrition education and
  health promotion services'
- 'Step 2: eHealth interventions deliver nutrition education content via accessible digital platforms'
- 'Step 3: Tailored messaging about SSB consumption reaches adolescents regardless of geographic location
  or economic resources'
- 'Step 4: Reduced sugar-sweetened beverage consumption observed following intervention'

description: eHealth dietary interventions demonstrated significant decreases in sugar-sweetened beverage
  consumption among disadvantaged adolescents, including those from low SES and geographically remote
  backgrounds

  description: 56% of participants were low-mid SES; eHealth may be particularly effective for reaching
    this underserved population
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'High SSB consumption among disadvantaged youth reflects structural factors including
    marketing exposure, food environment, and limited access to nutrition education - not simply poor
    choices. eHealth interventions address the access barrier component of this structural problem. Equity
    implications: reducing SSB consumption in disadvantaged populations may help reduce obesity and diabetes
    disparities.'
