direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smoking cessation services are integrated into existing opioid agonist therapy (OAT) clinics
  where patients already receive regular care'
- 'Step 2: Integration reduces access barriers by providing services at familiar, trusted locations that
  patients visit routinely'
- 'Step 3: Free provision of smoking cessation medications and individualized choice of medication and
  tapering regimen increases intervention acceptability'
- 'Step 4: Regular weekly contact maintains engagement and provides ongoing support for behavior change'
- 'Step 5: Reduced number of cigarettes smoked (from median 70 to 26 per week) among participants who
  completed all visits'

description: Integration of smoking cessation services into OAT clinics reduced cigarette consumption
  by more than half among patients who completed the 12-week intervention, though only 1 of 25 participants
  achieved complete cessation

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to smoking cessation care for people
    with opioid use disorder by integrating services into existing treatment infrastructure. The 85% smoking
    prevalence among OAT patients reflects systemic failure to address tobacco use in addiction treatment
    settings. The intervention model reduces stigma and access barriers by leveraging trusted relationships
    and eliminating cost barriers. However, the low quit rate (4%) suggests that structural intervention
    alone may be insufficient without addressing underlying social determinants that perpetuate tobacco
    dependence in marginalized populations.
