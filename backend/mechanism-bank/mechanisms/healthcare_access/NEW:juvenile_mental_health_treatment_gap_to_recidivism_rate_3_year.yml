mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Juvenile justice systems often lack adequate mental health screening and treatment infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Youth with psychiatric disorders including AUD remain untreated during probation/parole'
- 'Step 3: Untreated conditions contribute to continued behavioral dysregulation and poor community reintegration'
- 'Step 4: Authors conclude that development of education and treatment programs for psychiatric disorders
  may help prevent repeated criminal behavior'

description: The authors conclude that development of education and treatment programs for psychiatric
  disorders, particularly alcohol use disorder, among juvenile offenders on probation or parole may help
  prevent repeated criminal behavior. This implies that the current treatment gap contributes to recidivism.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism identifies a structural intervention point: the juvenile justice
    system''s failure to provide adequate behavioral health services. Rather than viewing recidivism as
    an individual moral failing, this framing recognizes that system-level lack of treatment resources
    perpetuates cycles of reoffending. Policy solutions include mandatory mental health screening at justice
    contact, co-located treatment services in probation offices, and funding for evidence-based adolescent
    substance use treatment within juvenile justice settings. This represents a shift from punitive to
    therapeutic justice approaches.'
