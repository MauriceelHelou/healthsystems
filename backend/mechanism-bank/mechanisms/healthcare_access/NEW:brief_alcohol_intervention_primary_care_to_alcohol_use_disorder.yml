mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system screening identifies hazardous and harmful drinkers not actively seeking
  alcohol treatment'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention (<60 minutes total, ≤5 sessions) provides structured feedback and counseling'
- 'Step 3: Information about potential harms and benefits of reducing intake increases health literacy'
- 'Step 4: Personalized reduction plans address individual patterns and motivations'
- 'Step 5: Reduced consumption trajectory decreases progression from hazardous drinking to alcohol use
  disorder'

description: Brief alcohol interventions in primary care target individuals at the hazardous/harmful drinking
  stage before they develop alcohol use disorder. By providing accessible, low-barrier interventions within
  routine healthcare encounters, these programs can prevent progression to more severe alcohol-related
  conditions.

  variation_notes: Mean baseline alcohol consumption was 244 g/week (30.5 standard UK units), indicating
    study populations were drinking at hazardous levels across different geographic contexts
moderators:
- name: baseline_consumption_level
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Studies included participants with mean baseline consumption of 244 g/week, representing
    hazardous drinkers who may benefit most from early intervention
- name: age_group
  direction: strengthens
  strength: weak
  description: Studies targeting adolescents/young adults (9%) and older adults (6%) suggest age-specific
    approaches may be needed, though evidence was limited
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates secondary prevention through healthcare infrastructure.
    The structural availability of primary care and emergency care as intervention points is critical.
    Communities with primary care shortages or healthcare deserts may have reduced access to these preventive
    interventions, creating structural inequities in alcohol-related health outcomes. The intervention
    addresses drinking patterns at a population level rather than blaming individual behavior.
