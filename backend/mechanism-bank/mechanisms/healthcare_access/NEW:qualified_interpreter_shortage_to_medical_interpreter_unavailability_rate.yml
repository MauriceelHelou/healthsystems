mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited investment in training and employing qualified medical interpreters restricts supply'
- 'Step 2: Demand for interpretation services exceeds available interpreter capacity'
- 'Step 3: Immediate interpretation needs cannot be met during medical encounters'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare encounters proceed without adequate interpretation support'

description: A limited number of qualified interpreters creates systemic unavailability of interpretation
  services, particularly for less common languages, creating healthcare access disparities.

  description: More common languages have greater interpreter availability

  equity_implications: Interpreter workforce shortages reflect policy decisions about healthcare system
    investment priorities. The burden falls disproportionately on immigrant communities speaking less
    common languages, creating tiered access to quality healthcare based on language group size.
