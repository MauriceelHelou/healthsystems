mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional SUD treatment systems predominantly offer abstinence-only approaches'
- 'Step 2: Scarcity of controlled drinking treatment options creates barrier for individuals unwilling
  to commit to abstinence'
- 'Step 3: Offering evidence-based controlled drinking treatments (BSCT, MET) provides alternative pathway
  into care'
- 'Step 4: Increased treatment options matching patient preferences leads to higher treatment engagement
  and entry rates'

description: The abstract explicitly notes that controlled drinking is an attractive treatment goal for
  a large proportion of individuals with AUD, but availability of supporting treatment methods is scarce.
  This represents a structural gap in the healthcare system that limits treatment access for those who
  prefer harm reduction over abstinence approaches.

  description: The study specifically enrolled patients with a stated goal of controlled drinking rather
    than abstinence, demonstrating that treatment goal alignment is crucial for engagement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural barrier in healthcare systems where dominant
    paradigms favoring abstinence-only treatment may exclude or discourage treatment-seeking among individuals
    with AUD who prefer controlled drinking goals. The study demonstrates that both BSCT and MET can effectively
    support controlled drinking, suggesting policy and practice changes to expand treatment options could
    improve equity in AUD care access. This is particularly relevant as treatment goal preferences may
    vary by cultural background, socioeconomic status, and severity of AUD.
