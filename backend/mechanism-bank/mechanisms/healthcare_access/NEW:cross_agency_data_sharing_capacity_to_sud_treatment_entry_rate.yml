direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal-legal system agencies (jails, probation, parole) identify individuals with substance
  use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Without data sharing infrastructure, individual-level health information cannot be communicated
  to community treatment providers'
- 'Step 3: Treatment providers lack necessary information to engage individuals upon release or during
  supervision'
- 'Step 4: Gaps in information transfer result in delayed or missed treatment entry for substance use
  disorders'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural deficiencies in data infrastructure create
    barriers to care for a marginalized population. Justice-involved individuals with substance use disorders
    face systemic barriers to treatment that are not of their making. Addressing this requires policy
    changes and targeted investment in data systems, not individual behavior change.
