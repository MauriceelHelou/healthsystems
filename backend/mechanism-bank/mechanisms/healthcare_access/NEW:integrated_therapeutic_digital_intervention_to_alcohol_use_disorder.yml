category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated therapeutic interventions combine multiple evidence-based approaches (cognitive-behavioral,
  motivational) rather than single-component approaches'
- 'Step 2: Multi-component interventions address multiple mechanisms underlying problem drinking including
  motivation, skills, and environmental factors'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive approach provides multiple tools for behavior change increasing likelihood of
  finding effective strategies'
- 'Step 4: Participants in integrated interventions nearly twice as likely to maintain low-risk drinking
  compared to PNF-only approaches'
- 'Step 5: Sustained low-risk drinking prevents development or progression of alcohol use disorder'

description: Participants receiving personalized normative feedback (PNF) alone were significantly less
  likely to sustain low-risk drinking at follow-up compared to those receiving integrated therapeutic
  principles (OR=0.52), indicating that comprehensive interventions addressing multiple behavioral mechanisms
  are more effective than single-component feedback approaches.

  equity_implications: This finding has implications for intervention design and policy. While simpler
    PNF interventions are less resource-intensive to develop and deploy, their reduced effectiveness suggests
    that investment in more comprehensive integrated approaches yields better population health outcomes.
    Healthcare systems and public health agencies must balance implementation feasibility with intervention
    effectiveness when selecting approaches for scaling.
