description: The CARE intervention hypothesizes that improved treatment quality will lead to better recovery
  outcomes, which in turn reduces healthcare utilization (a distal outcome of effective substance use
  disorder treatment).
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 2000
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Healthcare utilization is positioned as a downstream consequence of system-level
    treatment quality. This recognizes that high healthcare utilization among people with SUD reflects
    inadequate treatment system capacity rather than individual health-seeking behavior.
