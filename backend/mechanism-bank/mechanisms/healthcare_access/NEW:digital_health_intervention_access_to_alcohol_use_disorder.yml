mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions screen users for problematic drinking using validated tools like AUDIT'
- 'Step 2: Early identification enables intervention before progression to severe alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing digital support and monitoring helps maintain reduced drinking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Lower AUDIT scores indicate reduced alcohol-related problems and risk of AUD'

description: 'Digital interventions reduce AUDIT scores by 3.04 points (95% CI: 2.23-3.85) compared to
  controls. Given that AUDIT scores ≥8 indicate hazardous drinking, a 3-point reduction is clinically
  meaningful for moving individuals below risk thresholds.'

  equity_implications: AUDIT score reductions indicate that digital interventions can prevent progression
    to alcohol use disorder by providing early, accessible intervention. This represents a structural
    approach to secondary prevention that does not rely on individuals recognizing and seeking formal
    treatment. The scalability of digital interventions addresses the significant treatment gap in alcohol
    use disorder, where fewer than 10% of those with AUD receive any treatment.
