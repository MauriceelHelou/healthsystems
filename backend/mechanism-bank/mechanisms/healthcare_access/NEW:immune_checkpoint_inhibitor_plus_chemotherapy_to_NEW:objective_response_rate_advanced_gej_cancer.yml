mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ICI therapy enhances T-cell mediated tumor cell killing'
- 'Step 2: Chemotherapy causes direct cytotoxic damage to tumor cells'
- 'Step 3: Combined treatment leads to greater tumor shrinkage'
- 'Step 4: Higher proportion of patients achieve partial or complete response'
- 'Step 5: Measurable tumor reduction documented on imaging (objective response)'

description: Combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy as first-line treatment significantly
  improves objective response rate in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer
  compared to chemotherapy alone, with a 20% relative increase in response rate.

  equity_implications: Higher response rates may improve quality of life and symptom control. Access to
    combination immunotherapy requires specialized oncology infrastructure, which may be concentrated
    in urban academic medical centers, creating geographic disparities in treatment access and outcomes.
