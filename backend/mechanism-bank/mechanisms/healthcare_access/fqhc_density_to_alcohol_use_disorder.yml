- 'Step 1: General medical settings including FQHCs and primary care serve as access points for populations
  who may not seek specialty addiction treatment'
- 'Step 2: Integration of brief substance use interventions into routine care increases reach to at-risk
  populations'
- 'Step 3: Opportunistic screening and intervention during medical visits addresses alcohol problems before
  they escalate to severe disorder'
- 'Step 4: Reduced drinking behavior decreases progression to alcohol use disorder'

description: Healthcare infrastructure density, including general medical settings like FQHCs and primary
  care, provides structural opportunities for delivering brief alcohol interventions that can reduce drinking
  and prevent alcohol use disorder development.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism emphasizes that healthcare infrastructure is a structural determinant
    of alcohol-related outcomes. Communities with inadequate healthcare access have fewer opportunities
    for early intervention. The finding supports policies that expand healthcare access (Medicaid expansion,
    FQHC funding) as alcohol harm reduction strategies. Equity implications are significant: marginalized
    communities with healthcare deserts face compounded disadvantage in accessing these evidence-based
    interventions.'
