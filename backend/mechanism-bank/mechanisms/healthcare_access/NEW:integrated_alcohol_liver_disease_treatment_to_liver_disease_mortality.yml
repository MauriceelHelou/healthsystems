description: Integrated treatment approaches combining medical management of alcohol-related liver disease
  with psychosocial interventions like CBT/MET demonstrated promising outcomes for achieving abstinence,
  which is critical for preventing liver disease progression.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Integrated treatment models require healthcare system restructuring to bridge traditionally
    siloed hepatology/gastroenterology and addiction medicine services. This structural barrier to care
    coordination may disproportionately affect patients in fragmented healthcare systems and those lacking
    insurance coverage for comprehensive services. The review emphasizes need for real-world translation,
    highlighting implementation gaps.
