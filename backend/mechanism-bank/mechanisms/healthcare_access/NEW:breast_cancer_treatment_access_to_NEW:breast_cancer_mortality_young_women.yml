direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system provides access to comprehensive breast cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy,
  radiation, hormonal therapy)'
- 'Step 2: Timely treatment initiation prevents disease progression'
- 'Step 3: Multimodal treatment approaches improve tumor control and survival'
- 'Step 4: Reduced breast cancer mortality among treated patients'

description: Access to comprehensive breast cancer treatment is a key structural determinant of mortality
  outcomes. The paper attributes declining mortality in high-income countries to treatment availability,
  while increased mortality in lower-income countries reflects treatment access barriers.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Treatment access varies dramatically between high-income and lower-income countries,
    contributing to observed mortality differentials

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment access is fundamentally a structural issue determined by healthcare system
    capacity, financing mechanisms, and geographic distribution of oncologic services - not by individual
    patient characteristics or choices. The stark mortality gradient by national income level demonstrates
    how economic structures determine who receives life-saving treatment. This mechanism has critical
    equity implications for global health justice.
