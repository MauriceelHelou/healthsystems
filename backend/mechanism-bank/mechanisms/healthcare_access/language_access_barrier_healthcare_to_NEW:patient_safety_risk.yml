to_node:
  node_id: NEW:patient_safety_risk
  node_name: Patient Safety Risk
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unaddressed language barriers impair accurate communication of symptoms, medical history, and
  treatment instructions'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers cannot fully assess patient conditions or ensure informed consent'
- 'Step 3: Miscommunication leads to diagnostic errors, inappropriate treatments, or medication errors'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience increased safety risks during medical encounters'

description: Language barriers in healthcare settings create direct safety risks for patients by impairing
  clinical communication, leading to potential diagnostic errors, treatment mistakes, and adverse events.

  description: Healthcare professional attitudes favoring interpreter use can mitigate safety risks
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Patient safety risks emerge from structural failures to provide adequate language
    services, not from patient characteristics. The healthcare system bears responsibility for ensuring
    safe care regardless of patient language. This represents a healthcare equity issue where immigrant
    populations face differential risk exposure.
