mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Video conferencing-based therapy removes geographic and transportation barriers to treatment
  access'
- 'Step 2: Patients can maintain treatment continuity during external disruptions (e.g., pandemic lockdowns)'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive behavioral therapy delivered via telehealth provides equivalent therapeutic engagement'
- 'Step 4: Maintained treatment adherence leads to similar abstinence outcomes as in-person care'
- 'Step 5: Reduced alcohol use disorder severity through effective remote treatment delivery'

description: Video conferencing-based cognitive behavioral therapy for alcohol use disorder demonstrated
  non-inferior outcomes compared to traditional in-person treatment, with similar abstinence rates, psychopathology
  improvements, and quality of life outcomes across three cohorts (pre-COVID in-person, partially during
  COVID, and entirely during COVID lockdown).

  description: Treatments conducted partially or fully during COVID-19 pandemic lasted longer (higher
    treatment intensity), potentially compensating for remote delivery format

  description: Despite potentially negative effects of COVID-related lockdown measures, telehealth treatment
    maintained equivalent outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare delivery modality can maintain treatment
    access during systemic disruptions. The structural shift to telehealth during COVID-19 represents
    a natural experiment demonstrating that treatment accessibility need not depend on physical proximity
    to care facilities. This has implications for health equity, as telehealth can reduce barriers for
    individuals with transportation challenges, work constraints, or geographic isolation. However, digital
    access disparities may create new inequities for populations lacking reliable internet or technology.
