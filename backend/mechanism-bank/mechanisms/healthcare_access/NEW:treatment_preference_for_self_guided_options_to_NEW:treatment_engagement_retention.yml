mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Many individuals with cannabis use disorder prefer self-guided interventions over formal treatment'
- 'Step 2: Preference alignment reduces barriers related to stigma, scheduling, cost, and transportation'
- 'Step 3: Online delivery increases accessibility and convenience for continued engagement'
- 'Step 4: High retention rates (especially in MCII condition) result from better preference-matched intervention'

description: The study addresses the treatment gap by providing an intervention aligned with user preferences.
  High two-week retention in active intervention groups, especially MCII, demonstrates that preference-matched
  delivery enhances engagement in cannabis use reduction programs.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers to formal substance use treatment
    including stigma, accessibility, and system capacity. By providing alternatives that match user preferences,
    interventions can reach populations who would otherwise go untreated. This addresses the documented
    substance use treatment capacity shortage and treatment dropout patterns that create inequitable access
    to care.
