direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 quarantine measures reduced capacity of clinics and treatment centers'
- 'Step 2: Limited treatment capacity decreased access to medication-assisted treatment and counseling
  services'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to treatment led to treatment discontinuation and relapse'
- 'Step 4: Increased rates of opioid-related deaths due to inadequate treatment access'

description: Limited capacity of clinics and treatment centers during COVID-19 quarantine contributed
  to increased opioid-related deaths by reducing access to necessary treatment services for individuals
  with substance use disorder.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism clearly identifies healthcare infrastructure as a structural determinant
    of overdose mortality. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in treatment system capacity that were
    pre-existing but exacerbated by crisis conditions. This framing avoids blaming individuals for overdose
    deaths and instead highlights systemic failures in treatment infrastructure.
