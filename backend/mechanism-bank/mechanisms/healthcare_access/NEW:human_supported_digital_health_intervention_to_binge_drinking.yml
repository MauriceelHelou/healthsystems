mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Human support within internet interventions provides accountability, personalization, and therapeutic
  relationship elements'
- 'Step 2: Support may include email, chat, or telephone contact enhancing engagement and retention'
- 'Step 3: Human guidance helps participants navigate intervention content and apply techniques to their
  specific situations'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced engagement leads to greater behavior change and additional 6.78 standard unit reduction
  in weekly consumption'
- 'Step 5: Improved outcomes translate to sustained reductions in hazardous drinking patterns'

description: Human-supported internet interventions for problem drinking demonstrate significantly greater
  effectiveness than fully automated interventions, with an additional 6.78 standard unit weekly reduction
  in alcohol consumption. This suggests that combining digital accessibility with human therapeutic elements
  optimizes outcomes.

  equity_implications: This finding has important structural implications for healthcare system design
    and resource allocation. While fully automated interventions provide maximum scalability and accessibility,
    the enhanced effectiveness of human-supported versions (OR=2.23 for treatment response) suggests optimal
    population health impact may require hybrid models that balance reach with intensity. This has equity
    implications as human support requires greater resources and may not be equally accessible across
    all populations.
