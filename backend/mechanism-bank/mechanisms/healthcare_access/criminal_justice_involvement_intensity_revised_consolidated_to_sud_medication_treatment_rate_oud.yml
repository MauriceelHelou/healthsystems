direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice system referral to OUD treatment operates under different institutional constraints
  than other referral sources'
- 'Step 2: Criminal justice settings often have policies or practices that restrict or discourage medication
  for opioid use disorder (MOUD)'
- 'Step 3: Individuals referred through criminal justice system face structural barriers to accessing
  evidence-based pharmacotherapy (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone)'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of MOUD utilization result in poorer treatment outcomes for this population'

description: Criminal justice system referral to opioid use disorder treatment is associated with significantly
  lower rates of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) compared to referrals from other sources. This
  cross-sectional analysis of over 3 million treatment admissions (2014-2021) found persistent disparities
  in MOUD use, indicating structural barriers within the criminal justice system that impede access to
  evidence-based treatment.

  strength: moderate
  description: State-level variation suggests that policy environments differentially affect MOUD access
    for criminal justice populations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism clearly demonstrates how institutional arrangements (criminal justice
    referral pathways) create structural barriers to evidence-based healthcare. The disparity is not attributable
    to individual patient characteristics but rather to systemic differences in how treatment is delivered
    based on referral source. The persistence of this gap despite known effectiveness of MOUD represents
    a structural failure that disproportionately harms individuals with criminal justice involvement -
    a population already marginalized by the carceral system. Targeted policy interventions are needed
    to address institutional barriers rather than individual behavior change.
