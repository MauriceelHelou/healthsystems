direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare professionals lack adequate training and education on eating disorders'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians fail to recognize eating disorder symptoms or underestimate their severity'
- 'Step 3: Patients receive inadequate screening, delayed diagnosis, or inappropriate referrals'
- 'Step 4: Caregivers and professionals experience frustration navigating a system with insufficient expertise'
- 'Step 5: Overall treatment engagement is reduced due to systemic healthcare knowledge gaps'

description: Caregivers and healthcare professionals identified lack of eating disorder knowledge among
  clinicians as the most important barrier to treatment engagement. This represents a structural healthcare
  system failure in training and education.

  description: This barrier was identified as most important specifically by caregivers and healthcare
    professionals, suggesting system-level recognition of knowledge gaps
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a healthcare system structural deficit rather than patient-level
    barriers. The lack of clinician education and training on eating disorders reflects systematic gaps
    in medical education curricula, continuing education requirements, and healthcare workforce development.
    Addressing this requires institutional and policy-level interventions in medical training programs.
