- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems provide brief alcohol interventions (BIs) during prenatal care visits'
- 'Step 2: BIs deliver screening, feedback, and counseling about alcohol risks during pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Increased awareness and motivation leads to behavior change'
- 'Step 4: Pregnant women increase likelihood of alcohol abstinence by 56%'

description: Brief alcohol interventions delivered to pregnant women are moderately effective at increasing
  abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy, with a 56% increase in odds of abstinence compared to no/minimal
  intervention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects healthcare system capacity to integrate alcohol screening
    and intervention into prenatal care. The lack of evidence from LMICs highlights global health inequities
    in research and potentially in healthcare access. The finding that BIs work suggests structural solutions
    (routine screening in prenatal care) rather than individual blame for alcohol use during pregnancy.
