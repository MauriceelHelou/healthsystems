  equity_implications: Implementation of predictive biomarkers requires structural changes in healthcare
    delivery. Equity concerns include whether advanced biomarker testing will be available to all populations
    or only those with resources. Insurance coverage policies, healthcare facility capabilities, and workforce
    training are structural factors determining who benefits from precision medicine advances in AUD treatment.
