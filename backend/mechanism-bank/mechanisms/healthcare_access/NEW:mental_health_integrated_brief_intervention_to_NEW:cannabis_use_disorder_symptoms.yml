  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system fragmentation as a structural barrier.
    The separation of mental health and substance use services reflects broader healthcare system design
    issues that create gaps in integrated care. Young adults with comorbid conditions face compounded
    structural barriers when services are siloed. Addressing this through integrated brief interventions
    could improve equity in outcomes for those with dual diagnoses.
