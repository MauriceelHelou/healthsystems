mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current clinical protocols have limited integration of corticosteroids
  for peripheral nerve injury treatment despite evidence from 203 studies'
- 'Step 2: Lack of standardized treatment guidelines restricts physician prescribing
  patterns for peripheral nerve pathologies'
- 'Step 3: Limited clinical utilization continues due to knowledge gaps regarding
  mechanisms of action and safety profiles'
