- 'Step 1: Community pharmacy model offers flexible dosing times compared to traditional clinic-based
  programs'
- 'Step 2: Flexibility accommodates participants'' work, family, and other life obligations that create
  treatment barriers'
- 'Step 3: Co-location allows patients to pick up other medications simultaneously, increasing convenience'
- 'Step 4: Reduced structural barriers facilitate initial treatment engagement and sustained participation'

  equity_implications: Traditional OUD treatment programs often have rigid schedules that conflict with
    employment, childcare, and other responsibilities, creating structural barriers that disproportionately
    affect low-income and working-class populations. The pharmacy model addresses these systemic access
    issues.
