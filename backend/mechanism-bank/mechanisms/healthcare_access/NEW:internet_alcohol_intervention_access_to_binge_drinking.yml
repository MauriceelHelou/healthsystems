mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Internet-based interventions provide accessible, low-barrier treatment options for problem
  drinking that overcome geographic and time constraints'
- 'Step 2: Interventions deliver evidence-based therapeutic content including personalized normative feedback
  and integrated therapeutic principles'
- 'Step 3: Participants engage with intervention content leading to increased awareness of drinking patterns
  and motivation to change'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral modification techniques reduce weekly alcohol consumption by average of 5.02 standard
  units'
- 'Step 5: Reduced consumption leads to decreased binge drinking patterns and associated health risks'

description: Internet-based alcohol interventions effectively reduce weekly alcohol consumption among
  adult problem drinkers by providing accessible, scalable treatment that overcomes traditional barriers
  to face-to-face care. The meta-analysis of 19 RCTs demonstrates a mean weekly reduction of 5.02 standard
  units compared to controls.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to alcohol treatment access. Traditional
    face-to-face interventions have limited implementation in routine care and community settings, creating
    treatment gaps particularly for those with geographic, time, or stigma-related barriers. Internet
    interventions provide a structural solution by increasing accessibility regardless of location or
    schedule constraints. Human-supported versions show stronger effects, suggesting hybrid models may
    optimize outcomes while maintaining accessibility.
