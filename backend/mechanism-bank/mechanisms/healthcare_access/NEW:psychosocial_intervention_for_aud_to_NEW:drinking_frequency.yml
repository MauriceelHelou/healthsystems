  equity_implications: The null finding for harm reduction outcomes has important policy implications.
    Healthcare systems and insurers often prioritize abstinence-based metrics, but many individuals with
    AUD may benefit more from harm reduction approaches. This gap in treatment effectiveness for non-abstinence
    outcomes may perpetuate health inequities for those who cannot or choose not to pursue complete abstinence.
