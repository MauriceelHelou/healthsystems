description: Primary care settings represent an untapped resource for AUD treatment delivery, with the
  potential to dramatically expand treatment access given that only 7.8% of individuals with AUD currently
  receive any treatment. Implementing AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care could increase treatment access
  by meeting patients in settings they already use for healthcare.
quantitative_effects:

  variation_notes: Implementation occurred across three VHA facilities; the relationship between primary
    care capacity and AUD treatment likely varies by healthcare system characteristics

  description: Limited available resources was identified as a site-specific barrier, suggesting adequate
    resourcing moderates primary care capacity to address AUD
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system organization determines treatment
    access. The current specialty-based model for AUD treatment creates structural barriers that primary
    care integration could overcome. However, successful integration requires addressing the systemic
    barriers identified in this study (workflow, knowledge, attitudes, resources), not simply mandating
    that primary care providers add AUD to their responsibilities.
