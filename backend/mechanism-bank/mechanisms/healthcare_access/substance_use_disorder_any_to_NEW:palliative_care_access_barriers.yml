- 'Step 1: Individuals with substance use disorders face stigma from healthcare providers that creates
  unwelcoming care environments'
- 'Step 2: Complex co-morbidities including mental health problems complicate standard palliative care
  approaches'
- 'Step 3: Homelessness and housing instability among this population creates logistical barriers to receiving
  consistent end-of-life care'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare staff lack specific training in managing both addiction and palliative needs simultaneously'
- 'Step 5: Exclusionary policies in palliative care settings may deny services to actively using individuals'

description: People who use drugs and/or alcohol face multi-faceted challenges accessing palliative and
  end-of-life care, including access barriers, care quality issues, and healthcare staff skills gaps.
  These barriers stem from both individual complexity (co-morbidities, mental health, homelessness) and
  systemic issues (policies, staff attitudes, lack of specialized training).

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers in healthcare systems rather than
    individual choices. The review identifies that creating inclusive policies, sensitizing staff to distinctive
    needs, and facilitating training exchanges between addiction and palliative services are system-level
    interventions. The burden falls on healthcare systems to adapt rather than on vulnerable individuals
    to change.
