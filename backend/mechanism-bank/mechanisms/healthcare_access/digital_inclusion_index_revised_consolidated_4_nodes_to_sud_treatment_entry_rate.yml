- 'Step 1: Telehealth-based SUD treatment requires client access to technology and digital literacy'
- 'Step 2: Clients on community supervision may lack devices, internet access, or digital skills'
- 'Step 3: Technological barriers prevent some clients from accessing telehealth treatment options'
- 'Step 4: Need identified for treatment providers to support and train clients in technology access'

description: Digital inclusion affects telehealth-based SUD treatment access, with clinicians identifying
  the need for providers to support and train clients in technology access to overcome digital barriers
  to treatment engagement.

  variation_notes: While technological challenges were reported by both rural and urban clinicians, rural
    areas may face compounded digital access barriers due to broadband infrastructure limitations.

  description: Justice-involved populations may face additional barriers to technology access due to economic
    marginalization and supervision restrictions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies digital inequity as a structural barrier to healthcare
    access. The population on community supervision is often economically marginalized, creating intersecting
    barriers of poverty and digital exclusion. The recommendation that providers support client technology
    access represents a structural intervention to address this inequity rather than expecting individual
    clients to overcome these barriers independently.
