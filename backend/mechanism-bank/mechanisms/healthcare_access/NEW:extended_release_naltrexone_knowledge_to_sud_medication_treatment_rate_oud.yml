mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems and providers have limited dissemination of information about extended-release
  naltrexone (XR-NTX) as a treatment option'
- 'Step 2: Patients have limited knowledge regarding XR-NTX compared to buprenorphine'
- 'Step 3: Limited awareness restricts patient ability to make informed treatment choices'
- 'Step 4: Underutilization of XR-NTX as a medication treatment option for OUD'

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies information dissemination and health education as structural
    factors affecting treatment access. The responsibility lies with healthcare systems to provide comprehensive
    information about all treatment options rather than with patients to seek out information.
