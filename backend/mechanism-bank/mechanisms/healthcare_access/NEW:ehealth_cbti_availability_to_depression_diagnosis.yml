- 'Step 1: eHealth CBTI increases treatment accessibility through digital delivery platforms'
- 'Step 2: Insomnia and depression are highly comorbid, with insomnia often preceding and worsening depressive
  episodes'
- 'Step 3: CBTI treatment delivered via eHealth demonstrates significant improvements in depression as
  a secondary outcome'
- 'Step 4: Improved sleep quality and insomnia reduction contribute to decreased depressive symptoms'

description: The meta-analysis demonstrated that both eHealth and in-person CBTI led to statistically
  significant improvements in depression as a secondary outcome. Given the high comorbidity between insomnia
  and depression, expanding access to CBTI through eHealth delivery could help address depression disparities.

  description: Higher dropout rates may reduce treatment effectiveness for comorbid depression
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Depression prevalence is higher in populations experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage,
    and access to mental health treatment is limited in many communities. The equivalence of eHealth CBTI
    for depression outcomes supports structural interventions to expand digital mental health services,
    potentially reducing disparities in depression treatment access and outcomes.
