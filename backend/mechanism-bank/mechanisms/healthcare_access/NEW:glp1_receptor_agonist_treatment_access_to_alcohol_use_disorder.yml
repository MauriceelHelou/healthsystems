mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systemic administration of GLP-1 receptor agonists allows drug to access receptors in both
  periphery and brain'
- 'Step 2: Central nervous system GLP-1 receptor activation modulates reward pathways and consummatory
  behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol craving and decreased reward from alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Decreased pathological alcohol consumption patterns characteristic of alcohol use disorder'

description: GLP-1 receptor agonists, originally developed for diabetes and obesity, show therapeutic
  potential for alcohol use disorder through central nervous system mechanisms that modulate reward pathways
  and reduce pathological consummatory behaviors.

  description: Systemic administration allows access to both peripheral and central nervous system receptors,
    enhancing therapeutic effect on consummatory behaviors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how pharmaceutical access and healthcare system capacity
    to prescribe emerging treatments represents a structural determinant. Inequitable access to these
    newer, often expensive medications may perpetuate health disparities in AUD treatment. The biological
    mechanism operates through brain reward circuitry rather than individual willpower, supporting a non-stigmatizing
    view of substance use disorders as treatable medical conditions.
