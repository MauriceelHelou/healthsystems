- 'Step 1: Surgical treatment removes pre-invasive ductal carcinoma tissue before malignant transformation'
- 'Step 2: Prevention of invasive progression eliminates the primary cause of breast cancer mortality
  in this population'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of invasive ipsilateral breast tumor events translate to reduced breast cancer-specific
  deaths'
- 'Step 4: 10-year breast cancer-specific survival rates are significantly higher in surgery group (99.6%)
  compared to non-surgery (96.0%)'

description: The meta-analysis found that 10-year breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) was significantly
  higher in patients who received surgery (99.6%) compared to those who did not (96.0%, P=0.010). This
  demonstrates that access to surgical treatment for low-risk DCIS has meaningful survival benefits.

  equity_implications: This survival benefit mechanism highlights the importance of equitable access to
    surgical oncology services. Healthcare system factors including specialist availability, hospital
    infrastructure, insurance coverage for cancer treatment, and geographic proximity to cancer centers
    determine who receives survival-improving interventions. The 3.6 percentage point absolute difference
    in 10-year survival represents a clinically meaningful disparity that could be magnified by structural
    barriers to care access.
