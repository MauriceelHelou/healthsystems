mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Remote/digital interventions (telephone or computer-based) are added to existing in-person
  alcohol/drug treatment programs'
- 'Step 2: Supplemental remote contact increases treatment intensity and continuity of care between in-person
  sessions'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced therapeutic engagement and support accessibility reduces treatment gaps and maintains
  recovery motivation'
- 'Step 4: Sustained treatment engagement leads to improved coping strategies and reduced relapse triggers'
- 'Step 5: Lower odds of returning to substance use (39% reduction in relapse odds)'

description: Remote and digital interventions that supplement in-person alcohol/drug treatment reduce
  relapse by 39% (OR 0.61). This systematic review of 34 RCTs demonstrates that enhancing treatment accessibility
  through telephone or computer-based support improves recovery outcomes for people with alcohol/drug
  use disorders.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to treatment access including geographic
    distance, transportation limitations, scheduling conflicts, and stigma associated with in-person treatment.
    Remote interventions can reduce inequities in treatment access for rural populations, those with disabilities,
    or individuals facing work/caregiving constraints. However, digital divide issues may create new disparities
    for those without technology access.
