direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PCPs receive structured training on AUD identification and evidence-based pharmacotherapy options'
- 'Step 2: Training increases PCP knowledge and reduces uncertainty about prescribing AUD medications'
- 'Step 3: Increased knowledge and reduced uncertainty leads to greater intention to incorporate pharmacotherapy
  into practice'
- 'Step 4: Higher intention to prescribe translates to increased availability of AUD medication treatment
  in primary care'

description: After training, 64.9% of PCPs who provided feedback mentioned pharmacotherapy and 71.9% intended
  to use the video consult service, with 71.1% of eligible PCPs attending the training. This demonstrates
  that structured education can shift provider readiness to treat AUD.

  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural deficit in medical education regarding
    addiction treatment. Most medical training provides inadequate preparation for treating substance
    use disorders, creating a systemic gap in workforce capacity. Training interventions address this
    root cause rather than blaming providers for knowledge gaps created by educational system failures.
