mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ketamine modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission through NMDA receptor antagonism'
- 'Step 2: Glutamate system modulation affects reward circuitry and craving pathways'
- 'Step 3: Reduced cocaine craving supports behavioral change efforts'
- 'Step 4: Decreased craving leads to increased abstinence rates'

description: Ketamine decreases cocaine craving and increases abstinence rates in patients with Cocaine
  Use Disorder through glutamatergic modulation. Currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies exist for
  stimulant use disorders, making novel interventions like ketamine particularly important.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of FDA-approved treatments for stimulant use disorders represents a structural
    gap in addiction medicine. Access to investigational treatments like ketamine may be limited by research
    participation barriers, cost, and healthcare system capacity. Equitable access to emerging treatments
    is essential given that stimulant use affects marginalized communities.
