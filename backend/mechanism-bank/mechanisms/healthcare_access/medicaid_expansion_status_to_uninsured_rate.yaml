direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: States adopt Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, extending
  eligibility to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level regardless
  of pregnancy or parental status'
- 'Step 2: Previously uninsured low-income adults gain access to Medicaid enrollment,
  including those who were ineligible under prior categorical restrictions'
- 'Step 3: Expanded eligibility leads to increased Medicaid enrollment, with corresponding
  declines in uninsurance rates across multiple populations (trauma patients, perinatal
  women, cardiac patients, cancer patients)'
- 'Step 4: Reductions in uninsurance are particularly pronounced among vulnerable
  populations including racial and ethnic minorities, low-income individuals, and
  those with high healthcare needs'

description: Medicaid expansion under the ACA significantly reduces uninsurance rates
  by extending eligibility to low-income adults previously excluded from coverage.
  Meta-analysis of 18 trauma studies found patients were 51% less likely to be uninsured
  after expansion (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.66). Systematic reviews across perinatal
  (24 studies), cardiac (30 studies), and oncology populations consistently demonstrate
  increased Medicaid coverage with corresponding declines in uninsurance, private
  insurance, and insurance churn following state adoption of expansion.
