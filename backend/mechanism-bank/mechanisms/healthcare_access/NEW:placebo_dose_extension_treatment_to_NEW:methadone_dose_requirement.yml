mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Open-label placebo administered alongside methadone creates conditioned therapeutic response'
- 'Step 2: Classical conditioning enhances perceived medication potency through learned associations'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with substance use disorder may have higher salience attribution increasing placebo
  sensitivity'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced placebo effect allows equivalent therapeutic benefit at lower methadone doses'
- 'Step 5: Reduced methadone dosage decreases risk of cardiotoxicity and respiratory complications'

description: This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial testing whether combining open-label
  placebos with conditioning/dose-extension methodology can enhance the effective potency of methadone
  in treatment-seeking OUD patients. The hypothesis is that placebo effects can reduce the required methadone
  dose while maintaining therapeutic efficacy, thereby reducing dose-dependent adverse effects including
  cardiotoxicity and respiratory complications.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses a structural healthcare delivery challenge - the tension
    between effective OUD treatment and medication side effects. By potentially reducing required methadone
    doses through placebo augmentation, this approach could improve medication safety profiles and treatment
    retention. However, the study does not explicitly address structural barriers to OUD treatment access
    or how placebo interventions might differentially affect populations facing healthcare access disparities.
    The approach avoids individual blame by focusing on neurobiological conditioning mechanisms rather
    than patient compliance or motivation.
