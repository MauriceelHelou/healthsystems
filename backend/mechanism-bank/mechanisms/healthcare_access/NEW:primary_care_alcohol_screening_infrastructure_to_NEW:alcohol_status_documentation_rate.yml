description: The REACH intervention demonstrated that providing structured implementation support to primary
  care practices significantly increases alcohol status documentation rates. Intervention sites increased
  from 56.7% to 60.4% recorded alcohol status, representing a statistically significant improvement compared
  to non-intervention controls.

  variation_notes: Comparison between 6 intervention sites and 344 non-intervention practices showed differential
    effects, with intervention sites significantly increasing recorded alcohol status while non-intervention
    sites showed no significant change

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on healthcare system infrastructure rather than individual
    clinician motivation or patient compliance. The study explicitly targets practices serving low-income
    communities, addressing structural inequities in preventive healthcare delivery. By examining implementation
    factors that improve or reduce uptake, the study identifies systemic facilitators and barriers to
    evidence-based care.
