direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pharmacotherapies for AUD are developed and tested using cue-exposure paradigms in laboratory
  settings'
- 'Step 2: Medications target neurobiological pathways involved in alcohol craving and reward processing'
- 'Step 3: Effective medications reduce cue-reactivity (craving response) when exposed to alcohol-related
  stimuli'
- 'Step 4: Reduced cue-induced craving serves as early efficacy signal for medication development'
- 'Step 5: Lower craving responses predict potential for reduced drinking behavior in clinical outcomes'

description: 'Eight pharmacotherapies demonstrated small-to-medium effects (Cohen''s d range: |0.24 -
  0.64|) on reducing cue-induced craving compared to placebo. This systematic review synthesized 63 effect
  sizes (47 for craving, 16 for psychophysiological outcomes) from 28 randomized trials testing 15 medications,
  finding that individuals randomized to medication reported lower craving following cue exposure.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how access to evidence-based pharmacotherapy for AUD
    depends on medication development infrastructure, clinical trial capacity, and ultimately healthcare
    system access. Structural barriers to AUD treatment access (insurance coverage, treatment facility
    availability, stigma) may limit who benefits from these pharmacotherapies. The review notes methodological
    heterogeneity that may slow medication development, representing a systemic barrier to treatment advancement.
