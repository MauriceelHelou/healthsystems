category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: System-wide alcohol screening identifies hypertensive patients with unhealthy alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention delivered in primary care setting addresses alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases physiological mechanisms contributing to elevated blood
  pressure (vasoconstrictive effects, sympathetic activation)'
- 'Step 4: Patients achieve clinically meaningful reduction in diastolic blood pressure (≥3 mm Hg) at
  18-month follow-up'

description: Patients with hypertension who received alcohol brief intervention had higher odds (OR 1.05,
  95% CI 1.00-1.09) of achieving clinically meaningful reduction in diastolic blood pressure (≥3 mm Hg)
  at 18-month follow-up.

  description: Study included only patients who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use, suggesting
    intervention effects may be concentrated among those with elevated baseline consumption
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare system infrastructure (routine screening,
    integrated SBIRT) can produce downstream improvements in chronic disease management. The structural
    approach of embedding alcohol intervention in primary care addresses the often-siloed nature of substance
    use and chronic disease treatment, promoting integrated care that addresses social and behavioral
    determinants within routine medical encounters.
