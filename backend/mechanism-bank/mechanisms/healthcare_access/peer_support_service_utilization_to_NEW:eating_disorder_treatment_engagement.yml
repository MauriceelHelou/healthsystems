description: The review recommends positive peer-support interventions as a key strategy to increase treatment
  engagement for eating disorders. This builds on the finding that social support is the most prominent
  facilitator of help-seeking.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Peer support programs represent a structural intervention that can be implemented
    at healthcare system and community levels. Availability of such programs depends on healthcare funding,
    policy support for peer specialist roles, and organizational commitment to integrating lived experience
    into care models. This shifts focus from individual motivation to systemic facilitation of recovery.
