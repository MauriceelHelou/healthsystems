mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions provide continuous availability of support and reminders'
- 'Step 2: Users can access motivational content and coping strategies in real-time when facing triggers'
- 'Step 3: Tracking features increase accountability and awareness of drinking frequency patterns'
- 'Step 4: Reduced number of days per week when alcohol is consumed'

description: 'Digital interventions reduce drinking frequency by 0.17 fewer drinking days per week (95%
  CI: 0.06-0.29) compared to control conditions. While a modest effect, at population scale this represents
  meaningful reduction in alcohol exposure frequency.'

  description: Significant reductions in drinking frequency observed among students
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Reducing drinking frequency has downstream effects on health and social outcomes.
    Digital interventions provide a structural solution by creating ubiquitous access to support that
    operates outside traditional healthcare hours and locations. This addresses time-based barriers to
    care that disproportionately affect working populations.
