description: One study found evidence of a statistically significant difference in favor of AA/TSF for
  alcohol addiction severity at 12 months (P < 0.05), though with low-certainty evidence based on single
  study.

  equity_implications: TSF represents an important bridge mechanism connecting professional healthcare
    systems with community-based peer support infrastructure. This integration model addresses the limitation
    of time-limited clinical interventions by facilitating ongoing community engagement.
