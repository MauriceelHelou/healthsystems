mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tailored baclofen prescribing involves individualized dose titration based on patient response
  rather than fixed dosing protocols'
- 'Step 2: Variable doses (low to high depending on individual) effectively suppress alcohol cravings
  in AUD patients'
- 'Step 3: Suppression of cravings reduces compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior and consumption'
- 'Step 4: Sustained treatment with appropriate monitoring leads to improved AUD outcomes and potential
  remission'

description: Tailored baclofen dosing, where physicians adjust doses individually rather than using fixed
  protocols, shows effectiveness in treating alcohol use disorder. The required dose to suppress cravings
  is highly variable between patients (low or high depending on case), necessitating individualized approaches.
  Observational studies using tailored doses consistently show good effectiveness, while RCT evidence
  is encouraging according to certain meta-analyses.

  variation_notes: Paper specifically notes French context where baclofen is approved without dose limitation,
    making French physicians more likely to use high doses with tailored prescribing

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system factors that determine treatment access
    and quality. The approval of baclofen without dose limitation in France represents a policy-level
    structural factor that enables tailored prescribing. The emphasis on physician training, availability,
    and monitoring capacity reflects healthcare infrastructure determinants that shape treatment outcomes.
    Structural barriers to accessing physicians with appropriate prescribing skills may create inequitable
    access to effective AUD treatment.
