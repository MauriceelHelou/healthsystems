description: 'The study tested whether an ultra-brief doctor-delivered intervention (brief oral advice
  plus information leaflet in <1 minute) reduced alcohol consumption among patients with hazardous drinking
  compared to AUDIT-C screening alone. At 24 weeks, the intervention group consumed 1046.9 g/4 weeks versus
  1019.0 g/4 weeks in the control group, a non-significant difference of 27.8 g/4 weeks (95% CI: -149.7
  to 205.4). The finding suggests that minimal interventions may not be sufficient to address hazardous
  drinking in primary care.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'The null finding has important structural implications: (1) Time constraints in
    primary care create pressure to develop ultra-brief interventions, but this may compromise effectiveness;
    (2) Healthcare system investment in alcohol interventions requires balancing feasibility with evidence
    of efficacy; (3) The study reveals a tension between scalable, low-intensity interventions and the
    structural supports needed to actually change drinking behavior; (4) Structural factors like lack
    of routine alcohol screening infrastructure, absence of treatment programs, and unavailability of
    self-help groups in participating clinics may limit intervention effectiveness regardless of intensity.'
