description: The CARE intervention aims to reduce treatment dropout by implementing systematic quality
  improvement processes that enable data-driven identification and support of at-risk clients.

    of dropout-reducing practices
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reframes treatment dropout from an individual client failure to
    a system-level quality issue. The intervention targets organizational capacity to monitor, identify,
    and respond to client needs, recognizing that dropout rates reflect treatment system performance rather
    than individual motivation.
