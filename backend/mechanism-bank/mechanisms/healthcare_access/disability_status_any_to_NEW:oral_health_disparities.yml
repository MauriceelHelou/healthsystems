mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: People with disabilities face multidimensional barriers including physical, behavioral, and
  structural factors'
- 'Step 2: Complex barriers interact to reduce dental service utilization across the care continuum'
- 'Step 3: Reduced preventive care leads to higher rates of untreated dental disease'
- 'Step 4: Oral health problems become more severe and require more intensive interventions'
- 'Step 5: Greater oral health problems observed in disability populations compared to those without disabilities'

  compared to those without disabilities, due to complex physical, behavioral, and multidimensional barriers
  in accessing dental services.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism demonstrates how disability as a social category intersects with
    structural barriers to produce health inequities. The disparities are not inherent to disability but
    result from healthcare systems designed without disability inclusion. Interventions must address multiple
    structural levels: provider training, physical accessibility, communication accommodations, and legal
    protections.'
