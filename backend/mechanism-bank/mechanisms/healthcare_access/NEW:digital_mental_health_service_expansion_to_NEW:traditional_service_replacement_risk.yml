mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital mental health services are implemented and scaled'
- 'Step 2: Policymakers may view digital services as cost-effective alternatives to traditional in-person
  care'
- 'Step 3: Risk of reduced investment in or closure of traditional mental health services'
- 'Step 4: Populations requiring in-person care or unable to access digital services may face service
  gaps'

description: Expansion of digital mental health services creates risk that traditional in-person services
  may be replaced rather than supplemented, potentially leaving gaps for populations who cannot access
  or benefit from digital modalities.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights a critical policy concern: digital mental health expansion
    must supplement rather than replace traditional services to avoid exacerbating inequities. Digitally
    excluded populations (elderly, disabled, low-income, rural without broadband) require continued access
    to in-person services. Policy must protect against cost-driven service replacement.'
