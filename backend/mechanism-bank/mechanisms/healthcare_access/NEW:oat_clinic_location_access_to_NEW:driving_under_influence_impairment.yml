direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OAT clinics located in areas with limited public transportation options create transport barriers
  for clients'
- 'Step 2: Clients receiving treatment from private clinics or pharmacies may face different access dynamics
  and less oversight'
- 'Step 3: Transport challenges combined with mandatory daily/regular dosing requirements increase likelihood
  of driving while impaired'
- 'Step 4: Private clinic/pharmacy patients showed 2.37 times higher odds of driving after using potentially
  impairing substances'

description: Limited transport options and geographic barriers to OAT clinics may contribute to impaired
  driving among treatment clients, with private clinic/pharmacy patients showing higher risk. This reflects
  structural barriers in treatment access rather than individual failure.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system design (clinic location, public
    vs private settings) and transportation infrastructure create conditions that may lead to unsafe behaviors.
    The structural issue is inadequate transport support for addiction treatment, not individual choice.
    Equity implications include that those without reliable transportation face compounded barriers to
    safe treatment adherence.
