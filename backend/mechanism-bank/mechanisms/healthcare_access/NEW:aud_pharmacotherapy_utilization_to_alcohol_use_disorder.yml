mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FDA-approved pharmacotherapies (disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone) are available but under-utilized
  for AUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Under-utilization limits patient access to effective medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 3: Lack of treatment options perpetuates AUD symptomatology and prevents recovery'
- 'Step 4: Improved pharmacotherapy utilization would reduce AUD prevalence and associated harms'

description: This paper reviews endpoints for AUD pharmacotherapy trials, noting that currently approved
  medications are under-utilized. The shift from abstinence-only to harm-reduction endpoints and incorporation
  of biological markers and patient-oriented outcomes may improve pharmacotherapy development and utilization.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'The paper highlights a structural barrier in AUD treatment: the under-utilization
    of approved pharmacotherapies. This represents a healthcare system failure rather than individual
    patient failure. The emphasis on harm-reduction versus abstinence-only approaches represents a structural
    shift in treatment philosophy that may reduce barriers to care. Equity implications include the need
    for patient-centered outcomes and provider-patient relationship quality in treatment.'
