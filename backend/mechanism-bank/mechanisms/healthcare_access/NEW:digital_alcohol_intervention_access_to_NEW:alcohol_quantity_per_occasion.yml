mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions provide personalized feedback about drinking quantities and associated
  risks'
- 'Step 2: Behavior change techniques including goal setting help users set limits for drinking occasions'
- 'Step 3: Problem solving techniques help users identify strategies to reduce quantity consumed'
- 'Step 4: Behavior substitution techniques offer alternatives to continued drinking during occasions'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in alcohol units consumed per drinking occasion'

description: Intervention participants drank approximately one unit less per drinking occasion compared
  to no intervention controls, indicating digital interventions can modify quantity consumed during drinking
  episodes through accessible delivery of evidence-based behavior change techniques.

  description: Behavior substitution showed strongest association with reduced consumption (-123.71 g/week
    in unadjusted model, 95% CI -184.63 to -62.80)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism enables harm reduction by making interventions accessible to community-dwelling
    populations who may not present to healthcare settings. The digital delivery model addresses structural
    barriers including limited provider time for brief interventions, geographic access constraints, and
    stigma associated with help-seeking for alcohol problems.
