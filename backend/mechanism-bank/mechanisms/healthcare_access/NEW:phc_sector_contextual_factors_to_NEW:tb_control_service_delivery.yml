structural_competency:
  equity_implications: TB control outcomes are fundamentally shaped by healthcare system infrastructure
    rather than individual patient or provider behaviors alone. This mechanism emphasizes the need for
    structural investment in primary healthcare capacity, particularly in underserved regions, to achieve
    equitable TB outcomes.
