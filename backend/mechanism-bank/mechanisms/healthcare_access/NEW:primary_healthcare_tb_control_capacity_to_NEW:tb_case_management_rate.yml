mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary healthcare (PHC) sectors serve as first point of contact for TB control in communities
  under integrated TB control model'
- 'Step 2: PHC sectors with adequate capacity can effectively trace patients and provide case management
  services'
- 'Step 3: Regional economic development affects PHC infrastructure and staffing levels'
- 'Step 4: Higher capacity PHC sectors achieve better TB case management rates and patient follow-up'

description: Primary healthcare sector capacity for TB control, including patient tracing and case management,
  is strongly influenced by regional development, with East China outperforming West China in TB control
  service delivery.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: East China delivers TB control service better overall than West China, with both pooled
    arrival rate of tracing and pooled TCM rate higher in East China than West China

  description: 6 studies identified patient characteristics as associated factors affecting TB control
    service delivery
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural inequities between regions in China, where
    economic development disparities translate into healthcare infrastructure gaps. The focus on PHC sector
    capacity rather than individual patient behaviors appropriately frames TB control as a systems-level
    challenge requiring structural investment rather than individual blame.
