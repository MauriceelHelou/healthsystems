- 'Step 3: Lower burden of attendance may reduce dropout due to competing demands'
- 'Step 4: Treatment retention remains comparable to in-person delivery'

description: The number of treatment dropouts was similar between cohorts receiving in-person treatment,
  partially remote treatment, and fully remote treatment via video conferencing, suggesting telehealth
  does not increase treatment attrition for alcohol use disorder.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 1838
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment dropout is often driven by structural barriers including transportation
    access, work schedules, childcare responsibilities, and stigma associated with visiting treatment
    facilities. Telehealth delivery addresses many of these structural barriers, potentially improving
    retention among populations who would otherwise disengage from treatment. This finding supports policy
    expansion of telehealth coverage for substance use disorder treatment.
