- 'Step 1: AUDIT screening tool is implemented in primary care settings to identify individuals with hazardous
  drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Cut-point scores determine sensitivity and specificity for detecting alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Higher cut-points reduce false positives but decrease sensitivity for true AUD cases'
- 'Step 4: Identified individuals can be referred for brief interventions or treatment'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 36 studies found that the AUDIT screening tool
  does not perform well for identifying individuals with alcohol use disorders, particularly in low-prevalence
  populations and among women. The study used random-effects meta-regression to assess determinants of
  specificity and sensitivity, finding significant variation by sex, AUD prevalence, cut-point scores,
  and standard drink size definitions.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 0.95
    type: percentage_change
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Countries with low prevalence of AUDs have higher false-positive rates compared to
    countries with higher AUD prevalence. Standard drink size varies by country and affects AUDIT performance
    for men.

  description: AUDIT performs less well in identifying women compared to men; screening accuracy is lower
    for female populations

  description: Countries and populations with low AUD prevalence have higher false-positive rates, reducing
    screening utility

  description: AUDIT score cut-point was significantly associated with both sensitivity and specificity;
    higher cut-points increase specificity but reduce sensitivity

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Standard drink size affects sensitivity and specificity for men but not women, creating
    geographic variation in screening performance
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers to equitable alcohol use disorder
    identification. The AUDIT's differential performance by sex represents a systemic healthcare access
    issue where screening tools validated primarily on male populations fail women. Geographic variation
    in standard drink definitions and AUD prevalence creates structural inequities in screening accuracy
    across countries. The finding that low-prevalence populations experience high false-positive rates
    suggests screening may unnecessarily burden certain populations while missing cases in others. These
    are healthcare system design issues, not individual patient failures.
