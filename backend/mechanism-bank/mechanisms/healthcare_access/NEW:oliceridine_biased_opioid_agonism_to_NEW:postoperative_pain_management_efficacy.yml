category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oliceridine acts as a biased agonist at mu-opioid receptors, preferentially activating G-protein
  signaling over beta-arrestin pathways'
- 'Step 2: This biased agonism provides analgesic effects comparable to conventional opioids for acute
  postoperative pain'
- 'Step 3: Effective pain control is achieved within 72 hours post-surgery through intravenous administration'

description: This systematic review protocol aims to evaluate whether oliceridine, a novel biased opioid
  agonist, provides effective pain management for acute postoperative pain compared to placebo or morphine.
  The planned meta-analysis will synthesize evidence from RCTs examining efficacy within 72 hours post-surgery.

  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare system access to newer pharmacological options
    for pain management. The availability of alternative opioids with potentially fewer side effects could
    have implications for reducing opioid-related harms at population level. However, access to such medications
    may vary by insurance status, hospital formulary decisions, and healthcare system resources, potentially
    creating disparities in pain management quality.
