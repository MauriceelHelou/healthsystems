mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Effective care coordination systems connect residential treatment with other VA clinic settings'
- 'Step 2: Coordination facilitates referral pathways to prescribers when not available on-site'
- 'Step 3: Continued medication management transitions smoothly between residential and outpatient settings'
- 'Step 4: Improved initiation and continuation of AUD pharmacotherapy across care transitions'

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies healthcare system fragmentation as a structural barrier.
    Veterans with severe AUD who need residential treatment may be systematically disadvantaged by poor
    care coordination, reflecting system-level rather than individual-level factors.
