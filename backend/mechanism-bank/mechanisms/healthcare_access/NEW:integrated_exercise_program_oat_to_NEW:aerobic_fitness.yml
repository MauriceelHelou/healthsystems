description: 'Integration of structured exercise programs into OAT clinics improved aerobic fitness as
  measured by 4-minute step test, with pre-test mean of 89.4 (SD: 24.7) increasing to post-test mean of
  103.1 (SD: 31.3) step-cycles over 6 weeks, despite only 28% attendance rate.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to exercise for people receiving OAT
    by embedding programs within existing healthcare infrastructure. The clinic setting provides a supportive
    environment and reduces transportation/access barriers that disproportionately affect this marginalized
    population. However, the low attendance highlights persistent structural challenges including health
    issues and logistical barriers that require additional support systems.
