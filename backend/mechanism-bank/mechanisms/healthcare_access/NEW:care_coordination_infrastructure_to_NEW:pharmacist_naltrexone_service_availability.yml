direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pharmacist injection services require coordination with prescribing practitioners for naltrexone
  orders'
- 'Step 2: Effective communication systems between pharmacy staff, patients, and prescribers enable service
  delivery'
- 'Step 3: Established coordination protocols reduce administrative barriers and service interruptions'
- 'Step 4: Sustained coordination infrastructure supports ongoing service availability and patient retention
  in treatment'

description: The service process for pharmacist-provided naltrexone injections requires considerable coordination
  and communication with practitioners, patients, and pharmacy staff, representing both a barrier and
  a facilitator depending on infrastructure availability.

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies coordination infrastructure as a systemic factor affecting
    service delivery, rather than attributing success or failure to individual pharmacist motivation.
    Healthcare system integration and communication pathways are structural elements that shape treatment
    accessibility.
