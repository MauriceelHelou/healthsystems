mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: States adopt Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, extending
  eligibility to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level'
- 'Step 2: Previously uninsured individuals gain Medicaid coverage, reducing financial
  barriers to accessing healthcare services'
- 'Step 3: With insurance coverage, individuals can now afford and access preventive
  care services including cardiac screenings and treatment of comorbidities'
- 'Step 4: Increased utilization of preventive cardiac care services, including screening
  for and treatment of cardiac risk factors and comorbidities'

description: A systematic review of 30 studies examining Medicaid expansion under
  the ACA found that expansion was generally associated with increased insurance coverage
  and improvements in cardiac-focused prevention and screening. Of the included studies,
  41.1% assessed preventive care outcomes, with findings indicating some increase
  in screening for and treatment of cardiac comorbidities in expansion states compared
  to non-expansion states.

    care settings, suggesting preventive care utilization has greater impact in outpatient/community
    settings
