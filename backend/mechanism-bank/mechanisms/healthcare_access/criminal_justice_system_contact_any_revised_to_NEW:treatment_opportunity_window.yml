description: Criminal justice system contact among methamphetamine users represents a critical window
  for treatment intervention. The authors recommend prioritizing treatment during CJS contact based on
  findings that pre-CJS methamphetamine use predicts adverse health and criminal justice outcomes. This
  highlights CJS as a potential structural intervention point.

  description: Availability of evidence-based treatment during CJS contact is essential for this opportunity
    to translate into improved outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies CJS contact as a potential structural intervention point
    rather than merely a punitive outcome. Recognizing that CJS-involved populations have higher rates
    of substance use disorders, the system could be restructured to prioritize treatment access. Current
    failures to provide adequate treatment reflect structural underinvestment in correctional healthcare
    and prioritization of punishment over rehabilitation.
