mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant individuals receive buprenorphine-naloxone for opioid use disorder treatment'
- 'Step 2: Reduced severity of neonatal abstinence syndrome in exposed newborns'
- 'Step 3: Less intensive monitoring and treatment required for neonatal withdrawal'
- 'Step 4: Fewer newborns require intensive care unit level of care'
- 'Step 5: Modestly lower NICU admission rates among exposed infants'

description: Prenatal buprenorphine-naloxone exposure was associated with a 9% lower risk of NICU admission
  compared to buprenorphine alone (absolute risk 30.6% vs 34.9%).

  equity_implications: NICU admissions represent significant healthcare resource utilization and family
    disruption. Reducing NICU admissions through optimal medication treatment supports both maternal-infant
    bonding and reduces healthcare system burden. This has equity implications as Medicaid populations
    may face additional barriers to extended NICU stays.
