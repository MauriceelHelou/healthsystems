direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Armed conflict increases population risk for harmful alcohol use through trauma and disruption'
- 'Step 2: Humanitarian health responses prioritize acute physical injuries and infectious diseases over
  substance use'
- 'Step 3: No evidence-based interventions for harmful alcohol use are implemented in conflict-affected
  populations'
- 'Step 4: Without screening, brief intervention, or treatment services, harmful alcohol use goes unaddressed'
- 'Step 5: Untreated alcohol use disorders persist and potentially worsen over time in conflict-affected
  populations'

description: The systematic review identified no studies on the effectiveness of interventions for harmful
  alcohol use in conflict-affected populations, revealing a critical gap in humanitarian health response.
  This structural absence of evidence and programming perpetuates harmful alcohol use among the over 200
  million conflict-affected civilians globally.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The intervention gap affects all conflict-affected LMICs, though baseline alcohol treatment
    capacity varies by region and country
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers the structural failure of humanitarian and health systems
    to address alcohol harm rather than individual failure to seek treatment. The complete absence of
    intervention studies represents systemic neglect of substance use within global health and humanitarian
    priorities. This has significant equity implications as conflict-affected populations in LMICs face
    both elevated risk and absent services, while high-income countries have comparatively more developed
    treatment systems. The finding calls for structural policy change in humanitarian response protocols.
