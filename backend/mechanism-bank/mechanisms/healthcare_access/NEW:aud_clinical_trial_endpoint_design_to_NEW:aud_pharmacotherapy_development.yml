mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional trial endpoints focus on abstinence-based outcomes or no heavy drinking days'
- 'Step 2: Novel endpoints including WHO risk drinking level reductions allow for harm-reduction approaches'
- 'Step 3: Biological markers provide objective measurement alternatives to self-report'
- 'Step 4: Patient-oriented outcomes and NIAAA recovery definitions expand scope beyond consumption alone'
- 'Step 5: Greater breadth of endpoint utilization better captures AUD symptomatology complexity, enabling
  more effective pharmacotherapy development'

description: The paper argues that expanding clinical trial endpoints from abstinence-only measures to
  include harm-reduction approaches, biological markers, and patient-centered outcomes will improve pharmacotherapy
  development for AUD.

  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers in pharmaceutical research and development.
    The historical focus on abstinence-only endpoints reflects a moralistic rather than medical approach
    to AUD treatment that may have limited treatment development. Shifting to harm-reduction and patient-centered
    approaches acknowledges AUD as a complex medical condition requiring nuanced treatment strategies.
    This structural change in research methodology could reduce treatment disparities by validating incremental
    improvement rather than requiring complete abstinence.
