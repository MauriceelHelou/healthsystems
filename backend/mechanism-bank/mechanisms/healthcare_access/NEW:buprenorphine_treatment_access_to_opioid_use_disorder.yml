direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Buprenorphine as a mu-opioid partial agonist reduces opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Medication-assisted treatment enables stabilization and engagement in recovery services'
- 'Step 3: Treatment response (measured by negative urine drug screens) indicates reduced illicit opioid
  use'
- 'Step 4: Sustained treatment adherence improves long-term recovery outcomes'

  variation_notes: VA healthcare system provides a specific structural context; treatment access and outcomes
    likely vary by geographic availability of buprenorphine prescribers and state-level medication-assisted
    treatment policies

    affect adherence and response
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights structural barriers to effective OUD treatment: (1)
    variable access to buprenorphine prescribers across regions, (2) regulatory barriers (X-waiver requirements
    historically), (3) insurance coverage disparities, (4) stigma in healthcare settings affecting treatment
    engagement. The VA system represents a unique structural context with integrated care that may not
    generalize to civilian populations facing greater access barriers.'
