- 'Step 1: Demonstration project trains and equips SUD treatment facilities to provide XR-NTX'
- 'Step 2: Geographic mapping identifies referring agencies across Los Angeles County Service Planning
  Areas'
- 'Step 3: Patients with alcohol use disorder (71.9% of recipients) gain access to FDA-approved medication'
- 'Step 4: Multiple doses administered (64% received more than 1 dose), indicating treatment engagement'
- 'Step 5: Reduced barriers to pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder at the community level'

description: The demonstration project significantly expanded access to medication-assisted treatment
  for alcohol use disorder, with 71.9% of 609 patients receiving XR-NTX reporting alcohol use disorder.
  This represents a structural intervention to address the gap between evidence-based treatment availability
  and patient need for alcohol use disorder pharmacotherapy.

  description: Majority of patients (71.9%, n=438) reported alcohol use disorder as primary condition,

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the structural gap in alcohol use disorder treatment
    - despite FDA-approved medications being available, real-world implementation requires coordinated
    public health efforts. The high proportion of alcohol use disorder patients (71.9%) demonstrates unmet
    need in the community. The project addresses healthcare system barriers rather than framing treatment
    access as an individual responsibility.
