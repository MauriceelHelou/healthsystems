mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital platforms deliver integrated treatment addressing alcohol use alongside depression'
- 'Step 2: Reduced barriers to treatment access (time, cost, stigma) increase engagement with therapeutic
  content'
- 'Step 3: Interventions provide self-monitoring, feedback, and skill-building for reducing alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Treatment of comorbid depression reduces alcohol use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 5: Sustained engagement produces delayed but significant reductions in problematic alcohol use'

description: Digital interventions addressing both depression and problematic alcohol use produce small
  but significant reductions in alcohol use at 6-month follow-up, though effects appear delayed compared
  to depression outcomes and are sensitive to analytical choices.

  description: Effect on alcohol use non-significant at 3-month follow-up (g=0.14, p=0.07) but significant
    at 6-month follow-up (g=0.14, p=0.005), suggesting delayed treatment effects for alcohol outcomes

  description: Sensitivity analysis indicated 6-month alcohol use finding was sensitive to statistical
    estimator choice, suggesting some uncertainty in the robustness of findings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how technology-based solutions can address structural
    barriers in substance use treatment systems, including treatment fragmentation between mental health
    and substance use services, limited specialty provider availability, and stigma associated with seeking
    in-person treatment. The integrated approach reflects a structural understanding that comorbid conditions
    require coordinated intervention rather than siloed treatment systems.
