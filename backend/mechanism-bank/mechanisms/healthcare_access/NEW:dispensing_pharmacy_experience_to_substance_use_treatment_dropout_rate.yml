- 'Step 1: Patient experiences at dispensing pharmacies shape perceptions of treatment'
- 'Step 2: Positive pharmacy experiences (respectful treatment, privacy, convenience) support treatment
  engagement'

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies the healthcare delivery structure (pharmacy systems)
    as a determinant of treatment outcomes rather than blaming patients for non-adherence. Structural
    solutions include redesigning pharmacy services for patient-centered care.
