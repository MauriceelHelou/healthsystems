mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographic, transportation, scheduling, and stigma barriers prevent treatment seeking'
- 'Step 2: Only a small fraction of individuals needing AUD treatment seek care'
- 'Step 3: Lack of treatment access perpetuates untreated AUD in the population'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers disproportionately affect rural, low-income, and marginalized populations'
- 'Step 5: Telemedicine interventions can circumvent these barriers and improve treatment entry'

description: The study explicitly acknowledges that 'a small fraction of individuals in need of treatment
  for alcohol use disorders seek care, owing largely to barriers to accessing treatment.' The telemedicine
  intervention was designed specifically to address these structural access barriers.
quantitative_effects:

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Treatment access barriers vary significantly by geography, with rural areas facing
    greater shortages of SUD treatment providers and services

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism directly addresses the structural causes of the AUD treatment gap.
    Rather than attributing lack of treatment to individual motivation or denial, the study recognizes
    that systemic barriers—geographic distance, lack of providers, transportation challenges, scheduling
    conflicts, and stigma—prevent care access. This framing appropriately locates the problem in healthcare
    system structures rather than individual characteristics, representing a structurally competent approach
    to understanding treatment disparities.
