description: The adoption of WHO risk drinking level reductions as treatment endpoints represents a harm-reduction
  approach that may increase treatment accessibility and medication utilization rates for AUD.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Harm-reduction frameworks address structural stigma embedded in abstinence-only
    treatment models. By validating risk reduction rather than requiring complete abstinence, this approach
    may reduce barriers to care particularly for marginalized populations who may face greater stigma.
    This represents a structural policy shift in how treatment success is defined.
