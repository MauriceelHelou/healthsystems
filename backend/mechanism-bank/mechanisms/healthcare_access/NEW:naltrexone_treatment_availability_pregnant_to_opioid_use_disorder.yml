mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited naltrexone prescribers willing to treat pregnant patients creates treatment gap'
- 'Step 2: Pregnant individuals with OUD have reduced access to naltrexone as medication-assisted treatment
  option'
- 'Step 3: Without access to full range of MAT options, treatment may be suboptimal or inaccessible'
- 'Step 4: Continued OUD during pregnancy increases risks for mother and developing fetus'

description: The survey found significant barriers to naltrexone access for pregnant individuals with
  opioid use disorder, with only about one-third of responding sites offering this treatment option. This
  limits the range of medication-assisted treatment available to pregnant patients.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare system structure and policy gaps create
    inequitable access to SUD treatment for pregnant individuals. The survey response rate (33.1%) and
    limited availability (35.9% of responders) suggest systemic underinvestment in perinatal addiction
    medicine. Structural barriers including lack of guidelines, educational gaps, and geographic maldistribution
    create a two-tiered system where pregnant individuals' treatment options depend heavily on location
    rather than clinical need.
