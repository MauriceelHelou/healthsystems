mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions (apps, websites, automated programs) are deployed in accessible settings'
- 'Step 2: Self-guided tools provide feedback on drinking patterns and normative comparisons'
- 'Step 3: Lower barrier to access enables population-level reach'
- 'Step 4: At 12 months, digital interventions achieve equivalent outcomes to practitioner interventions'
- 'Step 5: Long-term alcohol consumption reduction is maintained without ongoing practitioner contact'

description: At 12 months, there is no evidence of difference between practitioner and digitally delivered
  interventions for reducing alcohol consumption (-6 g/wk, 95% CI -24 to 12), suggesting digital interventions
  may be equally effective for long-term outcomes

  description: Digital interventions catch up to practitioner interventions over longer time periods,
    achieving equivalence at 12 months
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The equivalence of digital and practitioner interventions at 12 months has important
    equity implications. Digital interventions could expand reach to populations with limited access to
    healthcare practitioners, but require digital infrastructure and literacy. This finding supports a
    tiered public health approach where digital interventions may be appropriate for population-level
    prevention while practitioner interventions may be reserved for those needing more intensive support.
    However, digital divide issues (broadband access, digital literacy) may create new inequities.
