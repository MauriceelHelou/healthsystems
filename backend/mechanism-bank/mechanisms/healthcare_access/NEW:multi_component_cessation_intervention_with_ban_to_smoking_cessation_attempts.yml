direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smoking bans create enforced abstinence period during incarceration/hospitalization'
- 'Step 2: Multi-component interventions provide pharmacotherapy (NRT, varenicline) and behavioral counseling
  during institutional stay'
- 'Step 3: Pre-release/discharge planning establishes transition support and continued access to cessation
  resources'
- 'Step 4: Post-release/discharge support maintains engagement with cessation services during high-risk
  transition period'
- 'Step 5: Combined approach significantly increases long-term cessation rates compared to ban alone'

description: Combining smoking bans with multi-component cessation interventions that include pre- and
  post-release/discharge support can significantly increase cessation rates. This approach addresses both
  the environmental restriction and the underlying addiction through comprehensive support.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that structural interventions (bans) are most effective
    when combined with accessible, continuous healthcare support. The populations affected (incarcerated,
    mentally ill, substance users) face systemic barriers to healthcare access, making the provision of
    integrated cessation support a health equity intervention. The finding argues for healthcare system
    investment in transitional care for marginalized populations.
