mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OUD treatment clinics make decisions about which payment forms to accept'
- 'Step 2: Only 55% of clinics accepting pregnant patients accept Medicaid as payment'
- 'Step 3: Pregnant individuals with Medicaid coverage face reduced pool of available treatment providers'
- 'Step 4: Economic barriers compound pregnancy-related exclusion to further restrict treatment access'
- 'Step 5: Lower treatment utilization among Medicaid-covered pregnant individuals with OUD'

description: Limited Medicaid acceptance among OUD treatment facilities creates economic barriers to care.
  Only 55% of clinics accepting pregnant patients during COVID-19 accepted Medicaid, compared to 95% accepting
  self-pay and 77% accepting private insurance, creating tiered access based on payment ability.

  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how healthcare financing structures create inequitable access
    to essential OUD treatment. Low-income pregnant individuals who rely on Medicaid face compounded barriers
    - both pregnancy exclusion and payment-based exclusion. This reflects structural economic inequities
    in the healthcare system that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.
