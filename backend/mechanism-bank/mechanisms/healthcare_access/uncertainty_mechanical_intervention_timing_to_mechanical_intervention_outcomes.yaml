direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Despite multiple randomized trials showing benefit, uncertainty persists
  regarding optimal patient selection and intervention timing'
- 'Step 2: Clinical uncertainty leads to inconsistent application of mechanical interventions
  (endoscopic vs surgical) across healthcare settings'
- 'Step 3: Patients at centers without expertise or with different practice patterns
  may not receive optimal interventions'
- 'Step 4: Inconsistent access to appropriate mechanical interventions results in
  variable disease outcomes across populations'
