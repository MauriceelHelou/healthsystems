mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care settings may offer more normalized, less stigmatizing treatment environment'
- 'Step 2: Integration with other healthcare services may improve patient experience'
- 'Step 3: Potentially shorter wait times and more convenient access in primary care'
- 'Step 4: Greater patient satisfaction may improve engagement and outcomes'

description: Although data from three studies regarding patient satisfaction could not be combined quantitatively,
  patients in primary care settings may have had greater satisfaction with OUD treatment compared to specialty
  care settings.

  description: Primary care settings may reduce visibility and perceived stigma of OUD treatment
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Patient satisfaction reflects structural factors including healthcare system design,
    accessibility, and stigma associated with treatment settings. Specialty OUD clinics may inadvertently
    create stigmatizing environments that discourage treatment seeking, particularly among marginalized
    populations. Primary care integration represents a structural approach to reducing treatment stigma.
