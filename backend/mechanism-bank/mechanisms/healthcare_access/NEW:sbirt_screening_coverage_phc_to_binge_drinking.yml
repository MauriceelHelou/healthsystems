description: The simulation found that even at 50% screening coverage with SBIRT, there was no measurable
  impact on heavy episodic drinking (HED) prevalence at the population level, despite reducing overall
  alcohol consumption by 12%. This suggests brief interventions may be more effective at reducing overall
  consumption than changing binge drinking patterns specifically.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This null finding is important from a structural perspective - it indicates that
    healthcare-based screening alone may not address deeply ingrained cultural drinking patterns like
    heavy episodic drinking. This points to the need for broader structural interventions (pricing policies,
    availability restrictions, cultural change) rather than relying solely on individual-level healthcare
    interventions. The finding avoids blaming individuals by recognizing the limitations of clinical intervention
    for behaviors embedded in social and cultural contexts.
