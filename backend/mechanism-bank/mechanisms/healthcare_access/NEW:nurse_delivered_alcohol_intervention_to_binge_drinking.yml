  equity_implications: This finding has important workforce and health equity implications. Nurses often
    serve as the primary point of healthcare contact for underserved populations and in community health
    settings. Investing in nurse training for ABI delivery could expand reach to populations with limited
    access to physicians or specialists, potentially reducing alcohol-related health disparities.
