mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Treatment services for AUD/PAU are fragmented and challenging to access'
- 'Step 2: COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted treatment availability while alcohol use increased'
- 'Step 3: Low utilization of available services due to various service-level barriers'
- 'Step 4: Untreated alcohol use disorder progresses, leading to increased alcohol-related morbidity and
  mortality'

description: The protocol acknowledges that substance use health services for AUD/PAU treatment were fragmented
  and challenging to access even before the pandemic, with low utilization when services were available.
  The pandemic increased alcohol use while simultaneously disrupting treatment access.

  description: Different types of treatment services have different barriers and facilitators affecting
    access
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces alcohol-related mortality to systemic failures in treatment
    service organization and accessibility. The focus on service-level barriers rather than individual
    treatment-seeking behavior appropriately locates the problem in structural factors. The review's equity
    focus recognizes that marginalized populations face compounded barriers.
