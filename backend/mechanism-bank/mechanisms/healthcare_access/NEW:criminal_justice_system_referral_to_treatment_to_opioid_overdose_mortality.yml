direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice system refers individuals with OUD to treatment programs'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers in criminal justice-referred treatment result in lower MOUD utilization'
- 'Step 3: Without MOUD, individuals experience higher rates of treatment dropout and relapse'
- 'Step 4: Lack of medication-based treatment increases vulnerability to opioid overdose'
- 'Step 5: Population-level overdose mortality rates remain elevated in this subgroup'

description: The pathway from criminal justice referral through reduced MOUD access ultimately contributes
  to poor health outcomes including overdose mortality. The abstract explicitly notes that targeted efforts
  are needed to address 'poor outcomes experienced by this population,' implying mortality and morbidity
  consequences of the treatment disparity.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how carceral systems perpetuate health inequities through
    institutional practices that restrict evidence-based treatment. Individuals with criminal justice
    involvement already face compounded disadvantages, and the treatment gap represents an additional
    structural harm. The solution requires policy-level intervention to mandate MOUD access in criminal
    justice settings rather than blaming individuals for treatment non-response.
