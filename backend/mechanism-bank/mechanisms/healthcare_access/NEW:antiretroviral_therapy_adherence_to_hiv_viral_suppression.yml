direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Consistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy maintains therapeutic drug concentrations in
  plasma'
- 'Step 2: Adequate drug levels effectively suppress HIV replication in target cells'
- 'Step 3: Sustained viral suppression reduces plasma HIV viral load to undetectable levels'
- 'Step 4: Viral suppression slows disease progression and decreases transmission rates'

description: 'Meta-analysis of 53 studies (n=22,603) found that overall ART adherence in Latin America
  and Caribbean was 70% (95% CI: 63-76%), which may be below sufficient levels required for successful
  long-term viral load suppression. Optimal adherence is closely related to viral suppression, slowing
  disease progression, and decreasing HIV transmission.'

  description: Factors leading to poor adherence may be setting-specific across different Latin American
    and Caribbean countries
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Suboptimal adherence reflects structural barriers in Latin American and Caribbean
    healthcare systems rather than individual failure. Setting-specific factors suggest that healthcare
    infrastructure, medication access, social support systems, and economic conditions vary across countries
    and influence adherence patterns. The finding that adherence is below therapeutic thresholds points
    to systematic failures in treatment support rather than individual non-compliance.
