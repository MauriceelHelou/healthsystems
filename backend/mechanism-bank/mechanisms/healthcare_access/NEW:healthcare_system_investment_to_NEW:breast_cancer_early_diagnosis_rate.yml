- 'Step 1: National investment in healthcare enables development of breast cancer screening infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Screening programs (mammography, clinical breast exams) become accessible to young women'
- 'Step 3: Regular screening increases detection of breast cancer at earlier, localized stages'
- 'Step 4: Early-stage diagnosis improves treatment options and prognosis'

description: Healthcare system investment in preventive services directly enables early breast cancer
  diagnosis through screening program availability. The paper identifies lack of early diagnosis infrastructure
  as a key driver of higher mortality in lower-income countries.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Early diagnosis availability varies significantly by country income level, with high-income
    countries having greater screening infrastructure

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism identifies healthcare system capacity as a structural determinant
    rather than placing responsibility on individual women for seeking care. The availability of screening
    programs is determined by national policy and investment decisions, not individual health-seeking
    behavior. Equity implications: women in under-resourced settings face structural barriers to early
    detection regardless of personal health awareness.'
