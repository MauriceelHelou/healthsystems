mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carceral institutions and CBOs often focus on substance use disorder treatment as a priority'
- 'Step 2: SUD treatment provides an existing touchpoint with healthcare system for people releasing from
  incarceration'
- 'Step 3: HIV prevention education and interventions can be integrated into existing SUD treatment programs'
- 'Step 4: Integrated services reduce barriers to accessing HIV prevention while addressing comorbid SUD'
- 'Step 5: Reduced HIV acquisition through integrated prevention delivered via SUD treatment infrastructure'

description: The study identifies opportunities to integrate HIV prevention education and interventions
  into substance use disorder treatment programs, which are already prioritized by carceral institutions
  and CBOs. This represents an implementation opportunity leveraging existing infrastructure.

  variation_notes: Washington State study; SUD treatment capacity and integration opportunities vary by

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Adding HIV prevention programming requires new funding; adequately funded integration efforts
    would strengthen the protective effect
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural opportunity rather than barrier - using
    existing SUD treatment infrastructure to deliver HIV prevention. This approach acknowledges the interconnection
    between substance use and HIV risk without blaming individuals, instead focusing on systems-level
    integration of services. The finding highlights how fragmented categorical funding (SUD vs HIV prevention)
    creates artificial barriers to comprehensive care.
