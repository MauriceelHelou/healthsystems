direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher pharmacy density increases geographic accessibility to medication-assisted treatment
  (MAT) services'
- 'Step 2: Pharmacist injection authority enables direct provision of long-acting injectable naltrexone
  without requiring separate clinical visits'
- 'Step 3: Reduced travel burden and increased convenience lowers barriers to initiating and maintaining
  OUD treatment'
- 'Step 4: Increased treatment engagement leads to higher rates of medication adherence and sustained
  recovery'

description: Community pharmacies can serve as significant access points for treating opioid use disorder
  with naltrexone injections, particularly important given shortages of behavioral health providers. Wisconsin
  law authorizes pharmacist injection services, though implementation requires substantial coordination.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 4
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study focuses on Wisconsin specifically; notes that only a small number of pharmacists
    currently use injection authority, suggesting geographic variation in service availability across
    the state

  description: Wisconsin's pharmacy practice laws authorizing pharmacists to administer medications via
    injection enable the service; states without such authority cannot implement this access point

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Service requires considerable coordination and communication with practitioners, patients,
    and pharmacy staff; stronger coordination infrastructure facilitates successful implementation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to OUD treatment by leveraging existing
    pharmacy infrastructure to expand access points beyond traditional clinical settings. The focus on
    behavioral health provider shortages appropriately identifies a systemic workforce gap rather than
    blaming individuals for not seeking care. Geographic disparities in pharmacy availability may differentially
    affect rural communities and those with limited transportation options.
