description: The study examined whether ED-based PRSS intervention could reduce all-cause ED re-presentation
  rates among OUD patients. No significant differences were found between intervention and control groups
  on this outcome. The authors note that ED represents a potentially critical intervention point for people
  with OUD.

  description: Authors suggest multimodal ED-based interventions may be more effective than standalone
    PRSS services
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes the ED as a structural healthcare touchpoint that interfaces
    with populations who face barriers to primary care and preventive services. The lack of effect may
    reflect broader structural issues including fragmented healthcare systems, lack of post-ED follow-up
    infrastructure, and insufficient integration between ED and community-based services. The study focuses
    on system-level solutions rather than blaming individuals for ED utilization patterns.
