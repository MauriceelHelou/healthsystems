mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare settings provide opportunistic access point to identify individuals with problematic
  alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions deliver structured motivational interviewing and feedback about drinking
  behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Intervention increases awareness of personal consumption patterns and associated risks'
- 'Step 4: Patients develop skills and motivation to reduce binge drinking episodes'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in frequency of binge alcohol consumption'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of healthcare system infrastructure in
    addressing alcohol use. Access to brief interventions depends on healthcare engagement, which itself
    is shaped by structural factors including insurance coverage, geographic access to care, and integration
    of behavioral health services in primary care. The differential effectiveness by sex suggests that
    intervention design and delivery may need to account for gendered social contexts of alcohol use.
