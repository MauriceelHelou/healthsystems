category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic prompts healthcare facilities to restrict services and patient populations'
- 'Step 2: 33% of clinics that previously accepted pregnant patients stopped doing so during pandemic'
- 'Step 3: Reduced treatment access leads to fewer pregnant individuals receiving OUD medication treatment'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or undertreated OUD during pregnancy leads to continued opioid use'
- 'Step 5: Prenatal opioid exposure increases risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome in newborns'

description: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a 33% reduction in buprenorphine clinics accepting pregnant
  patients, from 66 clinics to 44 clinics in North Carolina. This reduction in treatment access for pregnant
  individuals with OUD has downstream implications for neonatal outcomes including NAS.

  description: Areas with already limited pre-pandemic access (48% clinic exclusion) experienced compounded
    barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how external crises (pandemic) interact with pre-existing
    structural barriers to amplify health inequities. The decision to exclude pregnant patients during
    the pandemic reflects institutional prioritization that disadvantages vulnerable populations. The
    downstream effects on infant health outcomes illustrate how structural barriers in maternal healthcare
    propagate intergenerational health inequities.
