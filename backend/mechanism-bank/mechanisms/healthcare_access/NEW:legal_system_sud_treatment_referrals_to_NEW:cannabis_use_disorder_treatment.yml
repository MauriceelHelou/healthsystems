  description: State-level cannabis legalization reduces criminal justice contact for cannabis use, decreasing
    legal referral pathway
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The decline in cannabis-related legal referrals reflects structural policy changes
    rather than changes in cannabis use patterns. This illustrates how criminalization shapes who receives
    treatment and through what pathways. The racial disparities in cannabis enforcement mean that changes
    to this pathway have significant equity implications.
