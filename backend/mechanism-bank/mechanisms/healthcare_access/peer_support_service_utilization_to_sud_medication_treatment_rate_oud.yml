description: The POINT intervention aimed to increase OUD medication treatment linkage through ED-based
  peer support. OUD medication treatment linkage and duration were key secondary outcomes. No significant
  differences were found between intervention and control groups on treatment linkage or medication duration
  at any time point assessed.

  description: Ad hoc analyses showed treatment motivation and readiness vary by presentation type, with
    overdose patients showing lower readiness scores
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to treatment access by placing peer
    support services at a critical touchpoint (ED). The null findings suggest that peer support alone
    may be insufficient to overcome structural barriers to MAT access including treatment availability,
    insurance, stigma, and system navigation challenges. The study appropriately examines system-level
    intervention strategies rather than attributing treatment non-engagement to individual failure.
