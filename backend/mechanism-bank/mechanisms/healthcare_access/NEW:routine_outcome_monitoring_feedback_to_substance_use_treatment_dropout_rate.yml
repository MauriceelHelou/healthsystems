mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) systems collect regular data on client progress during alcohol
  and other drug (AOD) treatment'
- 'Step 2: Feedback from ROM data is provided to clinicians and/or clients, enabling real-time awareness
  of treatment progress'
- 'Step 3: Clinicians can adjust treatment approaches based on objective outcome data, particularly for
  clients who are off-track'
- 'Step 4: Improved therapeutic alliance and client engagement result from collaborative progress monitoring'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced treatment retention occurs as clients and clinicians have shared goals and measurable
  progress indicators'

description: Routine outcome monitoring with feedback to clinicians and/or clients in AOD treatment settings
  improves treatment retention, with 4 of 6 good/fair quality studies showing improved outcomes including
  treatment retention

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare system infrastructure and quality improvement
    processes rather than individual blame. ROM systems represent structural interventions that enhance
    treatment delivery capacity and quality. Implementation requires institutional investment in monitoring
    systems and clinician training, highlighting the role of healthcare infrastructure in addiction treatment
    outcomes.
