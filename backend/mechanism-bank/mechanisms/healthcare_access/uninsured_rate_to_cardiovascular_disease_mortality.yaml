direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher uninsured rates mean fewer individuals have health insurance coverage
  for cardiac treatments and preventive services'
- 'Step 2: Without insurance coverage, individuals face financial barriers to accessing
  screening for cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia)
  and preventive cardiac care'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to preventive care leads to delayed diagnosis and inadequate
  management of cardiac comorbidities that contribute to cardiovascular disease progression'
- 'Step 4: Undertreatment of modifiable cardiac risk factors and reduced utilization
  of evidence-based cardiac treatments increases cardiovascular morbidity'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative lack of preventive interventions and disease management results
  in higher cardiovascular disease mortality, particularly outside of acute care settings'

description: This systematic review of 30 studies demonstrates that lack of insurance
  coverage (higher uninsured rates) is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes
  through reduced access to preventive cardiac care, screening, and treatment. Medicaid
  expansion, which reduced uninsured rates, was associated with increased insurance
  coverage for cardiac treatments, improvements in cardiac-focused prevention and
  screening, and reduction in overall cardiac morbidity/mortality outside of acute
  care settings.
