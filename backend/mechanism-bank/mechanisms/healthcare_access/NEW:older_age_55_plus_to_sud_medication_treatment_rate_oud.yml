  compared to younger women veterans, indicating age-related disparities in evidence-based treatment access.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Age-related treatment disparities reflect structural ageism in healthcare systems
    where older adults' substance use problems may be overlooked, undertreated, or attributed to other
    causes. This disparity represents a failure of healthcare systems to provide equitable evidence-based
    care across the lifespan.
