- 'Step 1: Clinical trials use surrogate markers as primary endpoints to accelerate drug approval'
- 'Step 2: Only 54% of surrogate-clinical outcome pairs (59 of 109) reported correlation coefficients'
- 'Step 3: Among those reporting correlations, 83% (49 of 59) showed less than high-strength association
  with clinical outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare providers and patients make treatment decisions with insufficient evidence of real-world
  effectiveness'

description: This systematic review demonstrates that the evidence base supporting surrogate markers in
  chronic disease drug approval is weaker than commonly assumed. The median number of meta-analyzed trials
  per surrogate marker was only 2.5, and the majority of surrogate-clinical outcome pairs either lacked
  correlation data entirely or showed correlations below the high-strength threshold. This structural
  gap in evidence affects treatment decisions across 32 chronic diseases.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural deficiencies in the pharmaceutical evidence
    generation system. The emphasis on surrogate markers allows faster, cheaper drug development but creates
    systemic uncertainty about treatment benefits. Populations with chronic diseases who depend on these
    medications face structural exposure to potentially ineffective treatments. Health equity is affected
    as patients with fewer resources may have less ability to seek alternative treatments or navigate
    complex medical evidence.
