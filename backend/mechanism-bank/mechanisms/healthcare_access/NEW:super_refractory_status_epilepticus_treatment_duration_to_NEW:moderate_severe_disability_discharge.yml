category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended treatment duration reflects prolonged neurological crisis and sustained brain insult'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged sedation and immobility during treatment contributes to functional decline'
- 'Step 3: Extended ICU stay associated with critical illness myopathy and cognitive sequelae'
- 'Step 4: While survival improves with longer treatment, neurological recovery is often incomplete'

description: 'At discharge, only 26.8% of SRSE patients had none to slight disability (none: 8.4%, nonsignificant
  and slight: 18.4%). Very long-term treatment (>28 days) was associated with increased rates of seizure
  cessation but also increased risk of moderate to severe disability, representing a survival-disability
  trade-off.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects the complex trade-offs in treating severe neurological
    conditions. Access to rehabilitation services, long-term care facilities, and disability support systems
    will significantly impact post-discharge outcomes. The high disability rates suggest structural needs
    for rehabilitation infrastructure and disability support services. Health equity implications include
    disparities in access to post-acute rehabilitation care and long-term disability support across different
    healthcare systems and socioeconomic contexts.
