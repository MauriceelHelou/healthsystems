category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cessation of methamphetamine use triggers a characteristic withdrawal syndrome with physical
  and psychological symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Without approved pharmacological treatments, patients experience unmanaged withdrawal symptoms
  including craving'
- 'Step 3: Unmanaged withdrawal symptoms increase treatment discontinuation and relapse risk'
- 'Step 4: Amineptine showed potential to reduce discontinuation rates (RR 0.22) but is no longer approved'
- 'Step 5: Lack of effective pharmacotherapy options leaves a critical gap in methamphetamine use disorder
  treatment infrastructure'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 RCTs (n=242) found insufficient evidence for
  any medication being effective for methamphetamine withdrawal treatment. Amineptine showed promise in
  reducing treatment discontinuation (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07-0.72, p=0.01) and improving global state (MD
  -0.49, 95% CI -0.80 to -0.17), but this medication is no longer approved. The lack of approved pharmacotherapy
  represents a structural gap in healthcare infrastructure for stimulant use disorder treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights a critical structural failure in the healthcare system:
    unlike opioid use disorder which has FDA-approved medications (MAT), methamphetamine use disorder
    lacks any approved pharmacotherapy. This creates an inequity in treatment access between different
    substance use disorders. The predominantly male study population (88%) also raises concerns about
    generalizability and potential gender disparities in evidence generation. The finding that quality
    of evidence is ''low to very low'' on GRADE assessments reflects broader underinvestment in stimulant
    use disorder research infrastructure compared to other conditions.'
