direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OAT typically requires frequent (often daily) clinic attendance for supervised dosing'
- 'Step 2: Limited public transport options, clinic locations, and prescriber availability create access
  barriers'
- 'Step 3: Transport challenges can lead to treatment non-adherence, dropout, or unsafe self-transport'
- 'Step 4: Ensuring appropriate transport access is key to equitable and safe OAT delivery'

description: Transport availability is a critical structural determinant of equitable OAT access. The
  study emphasizes that beyond regulatory and clinical constraints, logistical factors including transport
  challenges significantly impact treatment access and safety.

  equity_implications: This mechanism centers the structural barrier of transport infrastructure in addiction
    treatment access. Rather than blaming individuals for non-adherence or unsafe driving, it identifies
    how healthcare system design and transportation policy create conditions that undermine treatment
    success. Equity implications are significant as those in transport-poor areas face compounded disadvantages
    in accessing life-saving treatment.
