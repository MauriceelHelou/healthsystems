- 'Step 1: Treatment programs systematically incorporate substance-free activity engagement support'
- 'Step 2: Patients receive consistent guidance and resources for identifying enjoyable substance-free
  activities'
- 'Step 3: Engagement in rewarding activities during early recovery provides alternative coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Patients develop intrinsic motivation through personally meaningful activities'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced engagement and reward during treatment reduces dropout and supports retention'

description: All participants reported that substance-free activities were introduced as part of treatment,
  but support was not consistently provided, particularly in group therapy settings. This inconsistent
  structural support during the pivotal early recovery period represents a treatment system gap that may
  contribute to suboptimal outcomes. Systematic integration of substance-free activity support could improve
  treatment engagement and reduce dropout.

  description: The early recovery period is identified as pivotal; inconsistent support during this phase
    may be particularly detrimental to treatment retention

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural deficiency in treatment program design rather
    than patient-level factors. The finding that treatment programs inconsistently support substance-free
    activity engagement despite its recognized importance reflects a systemic issue in how alcohol treatment
    is delivered. Addressing this requires institutional changes in treatment protocols and potentially
    resource allocation to support activity-based recovery components. The disparity between individual
    and group therapy support suggests differential access to evidence-based treatment components based
    on treatment modality.
