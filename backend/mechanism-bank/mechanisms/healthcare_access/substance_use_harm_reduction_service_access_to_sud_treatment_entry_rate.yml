description: Integration of harm reduction services within bridge clinic model serves as pathway to formal
  SUD treatment, demonstrating that meeting people where they are through harm reduction facilitates eventual
  treatment engagement.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 63
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Traditional abstinence-only treatment requirements structurally exclude many people
    who use drugs. Harm reduction integration represents a structural shift in healthcare delivery that
    acknowledges the realities of addiction and meets people where they are, reducing systemic barriers
    to care.
