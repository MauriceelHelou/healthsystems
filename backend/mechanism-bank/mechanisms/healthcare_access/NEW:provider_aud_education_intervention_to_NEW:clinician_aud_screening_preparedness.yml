direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Educational sessions specifically address screening and brief intervention techniques'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians learn standardized approaches to identify AUD in cirrhosis patients'
- 'Step 3: Practice-focused curriculum increases self-efficacy for conducting screenings'
- 'Step 4: Improved preparedness and comfort leads to greater intention to integrate screening into practice'

description: The educational intervention produced significant improvements in clinician preparedness
  and comfort with screening for AUD and providing brief interventions. Paired t-tests showed statistically
  significant pre-post improvements among the 95 clinicians who completed questionnaires.

  description: Clinicians with lower baseline comfort may show greater improvement from intervention
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural gap between hepatology practice and addiction
    medicine by providing clinicians with the skills and confidence to screen for AUD. The intervention
    recognizes that screening gaps are a system-level failure of medical education and practice organization,
    not individual clinician failure.
