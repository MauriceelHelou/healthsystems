- 'Step 1: XR-NTX made available through demonstration project at community treatment facilities'
- 'Step 2: Patients with severe substance use histories enrolled in medication treatment'
- 'Step 3: Treatment engagement measured through dosing records'
- 'Step 4: Higher cessation rates observed compared to criminal justice-supervised populations'
- 'Step 5: 36% of patients received only one dose, indicating treatment discontinuation challenges'

description: While 64% of patients obtained more than one dose of XR-NTX, the study found higher cessation
  rates and lower average number of doses compared to similar demonstration projects with criminal justice-involved
  populations. This suggests that voluntary community-based treatment may face different retention challenges
  than supervised settings.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment retention reflects structural factors beyond individual motivation -
    including healthcare system continuity, social support, housing stability, and employment pressures.
    The comparison to criminal justice populations highlights how structural supervision mechanisms affect
    treatment engagement, raising questions about whether community-based treatment requires different
    support structures rather than more coercion.
