description: ROM feedback in AOD treatment settings improves mood symptoms, representing co-occurring
  mental health benefits of substance use treatment quality improvement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The improvement in mood symptoms highlights the interconnection between substance
    use and mental health disorders. ROM systems that track multiple outcome domains support integrated
    care models that address the structural fragmentation of behavioral health services.
