category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care settings may offer more convenient appointment scheduling and location accessibility'
- 'Step 2: Reduced stigma in primary care may improve patient willingness to continue treatment'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive primary care may address multiple health needs simultaneously, improving engagement'
- 'Step 4: However, evidence for treatment retention difference is very uncertain'

description: The evidence is very uncertain whether there is a difference in treatment retention between
  primary care and specialty care settings for OAT delivery, with a risk ratio of 1.15 (95% CI 0.98-1.34)
  based on 7 studies with 1952 participants. Evidence downgraded for inconsistency due to high heterogeneity.

  description: Effects may vary based on integration of primary and specialty care systems within different
    countries
- name: Patient stability on OAT
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Studies included lower-risk patients who were already stable on OAT, limiting generalizability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment retention in OUD is influenced by structural factors including healthcare
    system design, geographic accessibility, and stigma. The uncertain findings highlight the need for
    healthcare system redesign that addresses barriers faced by diverse populations. Current specialty
    care concentration may systematically exclude populations with transportation barriers, work schedule
    conflicts, or concerns about visibility.
