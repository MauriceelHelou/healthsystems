description: Veterans with positive AUDIT-C screens who did NOT receive an alcohol-related brief intervention
  had 19% higher odds of receiving a new opioid use disorder diagnosis within one year compared to those
  who received the intervention. This represents the intervention's protective effect against OUD development.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding emphasizes how healthcare system protocols for addressing one substance
    (alcohol) can have cascading protective effects for another (opioids). The co-occurrence of unhealthy
    alcohol and opioid use reflects shared structural vulnerabilities including pain management inadequacy,
    mental health access gaps, and socioeconomic stressors. Integrated screening and intervention approaches
    address multiple risk pathways simultaneously.
