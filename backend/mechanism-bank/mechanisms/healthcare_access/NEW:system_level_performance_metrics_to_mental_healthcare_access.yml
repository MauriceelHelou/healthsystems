mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Agencies currently rely on individual-level data and risk prediction scores rather than system-level
  metrics'
- 'Step 2: Without system-level benchmarks (e.g., cascade of care), agencies cannot evaluate cross-agency
  performance'
- 'Step 3: Lack of performance evaluation prevents identification of systemic gaps in mental health service
  delivery'
- 'Step 4: System-level metrics enable quality improvement and accountability for mental health outcomes'

  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on institutional and policy-level factors that shape healthcare
    access. The absence of system-level metrics reflects structural underinvestment in infrastructure
    serving marginalized populations. Justice-involved individuals with mental health needs face compounded
    structural barriers; system-level accountability measures can help address these inequities.
