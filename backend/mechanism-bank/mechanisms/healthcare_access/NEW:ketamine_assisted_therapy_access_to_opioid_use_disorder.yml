structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to specialized ketamine psychotherapy for OUD is a structural issue involving
    healthcare system capacity, treatment regulation, insurance coverage, and specialist availability.
    Given the opioid crisis disproportionately affects certain communities, equitable access to novel
    treatments is critical for addressing health disparities in addiction medicine.
