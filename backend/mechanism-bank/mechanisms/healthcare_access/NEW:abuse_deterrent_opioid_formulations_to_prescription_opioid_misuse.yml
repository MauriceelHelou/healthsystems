mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Buprenorphine/naloxone combination formulation is prescribed instead of buprenorphine alone'
- 'Step 2: Naloxone component precipitates withdrawal if medication is injected or nasally administered'
- 'Step 3: Abuse-deterrent properties reduce incentive for diversion'
- 'Step 4: Lower street value and reduced euphoric effects when abused decrease demand for diversion'

description: The buprenorphine/naloxone preparation appears to be less amenable to abuse compared to sublingual
  buprenorphine alone, representing a pharmaceutical intervention that can reduce diversion in prison
  settings.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This represents a structural intervention at the pharmaceutical level - modifying
    medication formulation to reduce abuse potential rather than relying solely on behavioral surveillance
    of incarcerated individuals. This approach addresses the problem through systemic change rather than
    individual control, aligning with structural competency principles. Healthcare providers in prisons
    should be supported in accessing these formulations.
