direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Practice facilitators provide tailored implementation support including training, workflow
  redesign consultation, and HIT support to primary care clinics'
- 'Step 2: Clinics adopt standardized alcohol screening protocols and integrate screening into electronic
  health record workflows'
- 'Step 3: Clinical staff receive expert consultation and peer-to-peer learning opportunities that build
  capacity for SBIRT delivery'
- 'Step 4: Systematic screening processes increase identification of patients with unhealthy alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: Improved screening rates enable earlier intervention and referral to treatment'

description: Practice facilitation and multi-component implementation support (including expert consultation,
  data review, and peer learning) significantly improves SBIRT process outcomes in diverse, low-resourced
  primary care clinics, with 73% of participating clinics completing the 15-month intervention.

  variation_notes: Study conducted in Northwestern U.S. with diverse, low-resourced primary care clinics;
    results may vary by regional healthcare infrastructure and clinic characteristics
moderators:

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: 88% of clinics chose supplemental support over foundational support only; clinics engaging
    in practice facilitation (mean 293 minutes) showed greater improvement
- name: clinic_size
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Small and medium-sized clinics were targeted; resource constraints in low-resourced settings
    may benefit more from external implementation support
- name: hit_capability
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: 31% of completing clinics received HIT support; EHR integration capacity affects ability
    to systematize screening
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural healthcare system barriers rather than individual
    patient behaviors. Low-resourced primary care clinics serving diverse populations face systematic
    barriers to implementing evidence-based alcohol screening due to workforce constraints, inadequate
    training infrastructure, and limited HIT capacity. The intervention targets these structural deficits
    through external practice facilitation resources, thereby addressing healthcare access inequities.
    The flexible, tailored approach acknowledges that one-size-fits-all interventions fail to account
    for varied clinic contexts and resource levels.
