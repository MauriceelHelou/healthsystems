direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Use of smoking cessation treatments (including e-cigarettes) may produce side effects'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine delivery from any source can cause throat/mouth irritation, nausea'
- 'Step 3: Monitoring for adverse events during cessation treatment'
- 'Step 4: Low-certainty evidence suggests increased AEs with nicotine EC vs behavioral support alone'

description: Overall incidence of serious adverse events was low across all study arms. No evidence of
  serious harm from nicotine e-cigarettes was detected, though confidence intervals were wide. Longer
  and larger studies needed to fully evaluate safety.

  description: Illicit products and those containing THC may have different harm profiles than regulated
    nicotine EC
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Product safety is determined by regulatory frameworks, quality control standards,
    and market oversight. Unregulated markets may expose users to greater risks. Structural factors include
    FDA regulation, state-level policies, and enforcement capacity. Equity implications involve differential
    access to regulated versus illicit products based on cost and availability.
