category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol dependence who continue drinking have ongoing treatment needs'
- 'Step 2: Evidence supports combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches for active drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare system fails to provide integrated combined treatment to most actively drinking
  patients'
- 'Step 4: Less than 30% of still-drinking patients receive combined treatment, indicating major treatment
  gap'

description: Among patients with alcohol dependence who are still drinking, fewer than 30% receive the
  recommended combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, representing a significant
  healthcare system failure.

  equity_implications: This gap reflects healthcare system organization and treatment delivery structures
    rather than patient non-compliance. Improving integration of treatment modalities is a systems-level
    intervention.
