structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural integration of criminal justice and
    healthcare systems can address substance use more effectively than incarceration alone. The approach
    recognizes substance use disorders as health conditions requiring treatment access rather than moral
    failings deserving punishment. High rates of depression (91%) highlight the interconnection of mental
    health and substance use requiring integrated structural responses.
