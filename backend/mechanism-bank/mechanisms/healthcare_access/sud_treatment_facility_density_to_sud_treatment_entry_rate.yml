- 'Step 1: Limited availability of AUD/PAU treatment facilities creates geographic barriers to accessing
  care'
- 'Step 2: Fragmented service delivery systems require patients to navigate multiple disconnected providers'
- 'Step 3: Reduced physical accessibility decreases likelihood of treatment initiation and continuation'
- 'Step 4: Lower treatment entry rates result in untreated alcohol use disorder and problematic alcohol
  use'

description: This scoping review protocol aims to identify service-level characteristics affecting access
  to AUD/PAU treatment. Prior to COVID-19, these services were fragmented and challenging to access. The
  pandemic exacerbated these barriers, often disrupting treatment while alcohol use rose.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The protocol specifically aims to map barriers and facilitators stratified by service
    type and key measures of inequity across service users, suggesting geographic and demographic variation
    in access

  strength: moderate
  description: Virtual care was implemented to offset drops in in-person care, though accessibility was
    not universal
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on system-level and structural barriers to treatment access
    rather than individual-level factors. The review explicitly examines inequities in service access
    across different populations, recognizing that structural characteristics of treatment services create
    differential access. The protocol's focus on provider and patient perspectives aims to identify modifiable
    service-level factors.
