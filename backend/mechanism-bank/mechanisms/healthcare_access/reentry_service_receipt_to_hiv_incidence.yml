mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community-based organizations provide reentry services to people releasing from incarceration'
- 'Step 2: Some CBOs offer PrEP or other forms of HIV prevention as part of comprehensive services'
- 'Step 3: Many CBOs focus on meeting basic needs (housing, food, employment) which are prerequisites
  for engaging with health services'
- 'Step 4: Building community connection through CBOs creates pathways to HIV prevention resources'
- 'Step 5: Reduced HIV acquisition risk when prevention services are accessible during reentry'

description: Community-based organizations that serve people releasing from incarceration can provide
  HIV prevention services, but many focus on meeting basic needs or building community rather than directly
  providing PrEP. Effective linkage to HIV prevention requires addressing the primacy of basic needs first.

    services; primacy of basic needs means HIV prevention is lower priority until these are addressed

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the hierarchy of needs during reentry creates structural
    barriers to HIV prevention. Organizations must address housing, food, and employment before HIV prevention
    becomes accessible, demonstrating how poverty and structural disadvantage compound health risks for
    formerly incarcerated populations. The need for new funding to add HIV prevention programming reflects
    systematic underinvestment in reentry health services.
