direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Global shortage of over 7 million skilled healthcare workers (midwives, nurses, physicians)
  creates gaps in healthcare coverage'
- 'Step 2: Shortage projected to grow to over 12 million by 2035 with population growth'
- 'Step 3: Rapid urbanization concentrates populations in areas with inadequate healthcare infrastructure'
- 'Step 4: Inequities in healthcare access are exacerbated in urban areas of developing nations'
- 'Step 5: Populations experience reduced access to hypertension screening, diagnosis, and treatment'

description: The global shortage of skilled healthcare workers contributes to severe primary care shortages,
  particularly in rapidly urbanizing areas of developing nations, limiting access to hypertension screening
  and management.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Healthcare worker shortages are most pronounced in developing nations and less developed
    regions. Population growth in urban areas projected to be 2.6 billion between 2011-2050, concentrated
    in cities of less developed regions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how global workforce distribution inequities create differential
    access to basic healthcare services. The shortage is a structural issue reflecting healthcare workforce
    training capacity, economic factors influencing career choices, and migration patterns of healthcare
    professionals. The resulting access inequities disproportionately affect populations in developing
    nations and urban areas experiencing rapid growth.
