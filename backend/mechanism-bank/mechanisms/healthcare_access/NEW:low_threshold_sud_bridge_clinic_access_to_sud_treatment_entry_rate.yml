- 'Step 1: Low-threshold bridge clinics remove traditional barriers to SUD treatment (appointments, documentation,
  abstinence requirements)'
- 'Step 2: Same-day medication and treatment provision reduces time from help-seeking to treatment initiation'
- 'Step 3: Harm reduction services integrated with clinical care engage patients who might otherwise avoid
  traditional treatment'
- 'Step 4: Successful connection to community-based treatment providers establishes ongoing care relationships'
- 'Step 5: Increased treatment entry rates among previously underserved populations with SUD'

description: Low-threshold bridge clinics that provide same-day medication and treatment for SUD without
  traditional barriers successfully connected 78% of patients to ongoing community-based SUD treatment,
  demonstrating that reducing structural barriers to care entry improves treatment linkage.

  description: 16% of participants were unhoused, which may affect treatment retention and follow-up outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how traditional healthcare system barriers (appointments,
    documentation requirements, abstinence mandates) structurally exclude people with SUD from treatment.
    The bridge clinic model addresses these structural barriers rather than placing blame on individuals
    for not engaging with treatment. The 16% unhoused population demonstrates the intersection of housing
    instability and SUD treatment access.
