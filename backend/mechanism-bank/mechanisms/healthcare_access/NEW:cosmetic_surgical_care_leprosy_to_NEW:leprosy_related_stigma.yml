mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cosmetic or surgical interventions address visible physical manifestations of leprosy'
- 'Step 2: Reduction in visible signs decreases triggers for stigmatizing reactions from others'
- 'Step 3: Improved appearance reduces internalized stigma and self-concealment behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Greater social confidence enables reintegration into community activities and relationships'

description: Cosmetic and surgical care reduces stigma by addressing visible signs of leprosy that trigger
  discriminatory responses and by improving affected individuals' self-perception and social confidence.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Evidence from Nepal, India, and Indonesia; surgical service availability varies greatly
    across endemic regions.

    affected populations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism addresses physical manifestations, it should be understood
    within a structural context where societies discriminate based on appearance. Healthcare system capacity
    to provide these services represents a structural determinant of stigma reduction. Does not blame
    individuals for seeking to reduce visible differences.
