mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural health services experience chronic understaffing due to recruitment
  and retention challenges'
- 'Step 2: Insufficient staffing increases wait times and reduces attention to individual
  patients'
- 'Step 3: Patient dissatisfaction with care access and quality increases due to limited
  staff availability'
- 'Step 4: Frustrated patients are more likely to engage in aggressive or violent
  behavior toward staff'
