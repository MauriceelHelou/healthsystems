direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Many patients lack access to conventional SUD treatment due to capacity limitations'
- 'Step 2: Perceived stigma and reluctance to seek formal care further reduce treatment uptake'
- 'Step 3: Some individuals may not desire complete cessation of substance use'
- 'Step 4: These barriers drive individuals toward unregulated harm reduction alternatives like kratom'

description: Structural barriers to conventional SUD treatment including limited access, stigma, and abstinence-only
  approaches drive individuals toward unregulated alternatives like kratom
spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: Treatment access varies significantly by region in the US; kratom has historical use
    in Southeast Asia where treatment infrastructure differs

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers structural failures in the healthcare system—treatment capacity
    shortages, stigmatizing care environments, and lack of harm reduction options—rather than blaming
    individuals for seeking alternatives. The root cause is systemic underinvestment in SUD treatment
    infrastructure.
