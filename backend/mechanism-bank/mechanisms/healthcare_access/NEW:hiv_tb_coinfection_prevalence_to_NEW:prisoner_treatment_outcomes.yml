mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HIV-TB co-infection requires complex multi-drug treatment regimens'
- 'Step 2: Prison healthcare systems often lack capacity for coordinated HIV and TB care'
- 'Step 3: Drug interactions and overlapping toxicities complicate treatment adherence'
- 'Step 4: Treatment outcomes (success vs. death) may be compromised in co-infected prisoners'

description: Limited evidence exists on treatment outcomes for HIV-TB co-infected prisoners, with only
  9 studies identified and conflicting findings regarding the influence of HIV status on TB treatment
  success or mortality.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The review notes evidence is 'conflicting' regarding HIV status influence on prisoner
    treatment outcomes, suggesting significant between-study heterogeneity

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The paucity of outcome data (only 9 studies) itself reflects structural neglect
    of incarcerated populations in health research. The conflicting evidence suggests that structural
    factors (prison healthcare quality, medication access, continuity of care) rather than HIV status
    alone determine treatment outcomes. This highlights how criminal justice and healthcare systems interact
    to shape health outcomes for multiply-marginalized populations.
