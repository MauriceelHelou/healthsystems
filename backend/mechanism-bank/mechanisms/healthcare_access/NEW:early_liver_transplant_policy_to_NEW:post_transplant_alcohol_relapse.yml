direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional liver transplant policies require 6 months of documented alcohol abstinence before
  transplant eligibility'
- 'Step 2: Early liver transplant policies allow transplantation with less than 6 months abstinence for
  strictly selected patients with alcoholic liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Concern exists that shorter pre-transplant sobriety periods may increase post-transplant alcohol
  relapse risk'
- 'Step 4: Meta-analysis of comparative studies evaluates whether early transplant actually increases
  relapse rates'
- 'Step 5: Evidence shows no statistically significant difference in alcohol relapse between early and
  standard transplant protocols'

description: 'This meta-analysis examines whether early liver transplantation (less than 6 months of alcohol
  abstinence) is associated with increased alcohol relapse compared to standard transplant protocols requiring
  6 months abstinence. The pooled analysis of 3 studies with 367 patients found no statistically significant
  difference in relapse rates (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.75-2.06, p=0.40), suggesting the traditional 6-month
  rule may be an unnecessary barrier to life-saving transplantation.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding has important structural and equity implications. The 6-month abstinence
    rule has historically functioned as a gatekeeping mechanism that may disproportionately exclude patients
    with fewer resources to maintain sobriety while awaiting transplant. Evidence that shorter abstinence
    periods do not increase relapse challenges policies that may inadvertently create inequitable access
    to organ transplantation for patients with alcohol use disorder. The structural barrier of mandatory
    waiting periods can result in preventable mortality among patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis
    who cannot survive 6 months without transplantation.
