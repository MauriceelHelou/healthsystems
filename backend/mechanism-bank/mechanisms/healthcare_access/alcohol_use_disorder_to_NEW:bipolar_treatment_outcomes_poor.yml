- 'Step 3: Healthcare systems often lack integrated treatment protocols for dual diagnosis'
- 'Step 4: Fragmented care between mental health and addiction services creates treatment gaps'
- 'Step 5: Poor treatment outcomes perpetuate cycle of both conditions'

description: The paper emphasizes that addressing AUD comorbidity in bipolar patients 'may improve treatment
  outcomes, reduce harm, and promote public health,' indicating that the high comorbidity rate currently
  leads to poorer outcomes that could be improved through targeted interventions.

  description: Access to integrated mental health and substance use treatment would weaken the negative
    impact of comorbidity on outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism identifies a clear structural intervention point: the need for
    ''targeted interventions to prevent and address comorbid conditions.'' Current healthcare system structures
    that separate mental health and addiction treatment create barriers to optimal care for the 29% of
    bipolar patients with AUD. The paper frames this as a public health priority requiring systems-level
    change rather than individual-level behavior modification.'
