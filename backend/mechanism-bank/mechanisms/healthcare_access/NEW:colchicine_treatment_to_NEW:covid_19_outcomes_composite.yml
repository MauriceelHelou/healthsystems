description: Meta-analysis of 8 studies with 5778 COVID-19 patients demonstrates that colchicine administration
  is associated with significantly improved outcomes (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.34-0.55, p<0.00001) with no heterogeneity

  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare access and treatment availability. Equitable
    access to colchicine treatment during COVID-19 pandemic represents a structural healthcare delivery
    consideration. Disparities in medication access, healthcare provider availability, and health system
    capacity may create differential treatment access across communities. The finding supports policy
    decisions regarding treatment protocols and drug availability.
