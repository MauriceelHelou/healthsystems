mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The Ishii Test provides a non-invasive, simple screening method using age, grip strength, and
  calf circumference'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare settings can implement this low-cost screening tool without expensive equipment
  like DXA or BIA'
- 'Step 3: Increased availability of screening enables systematic assessment of older adults in clinical
  settings'
- 'Step 4: Early identification allows for timely intervention before progression to severe functional
  decline'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 diagnostic test accuracy studies demonstrates
  that the Ishii Test has good sensitivity and specificity for screening sarcopenia in older adults (age
  60+). The test, recommended by EWGSOP2, shows AUC values above the discrimination threshold (0.500)
  across all included studies, with summary ROC curves indicating good diagnostic performance for both
  men and women.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The availability of simple, low-cost screening tools like the Ishii Test can help
    address healthcare access disparities in sarcopenia detection. Expensive diagnostic equipment (DXA,
    BIA) creates structural barriers to screening in resource-limited settings. This tool could enable
    screening in primary care and community settings, potentially reducing inequities in early detection
    among older adults with limited healthcare access. The tool's reliance on simple measurements (grip
    strength, calf circumference) makes it implementable in diverse healthcare contexts.
