mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to psychedelic-assisted therapy (LSD or psilocybin) in clinical settings provides structured
  therapeutic intervention'
- 'Step 2: Psychedelics may induce neuroplasticity and alter default mode network activity, facilitating
  psychological insight'
- 'Step 3: Therapeutic sessions help patients process underlying trauma and psychological factors contributing
  to alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 4: Patients achieve abstinence or substantial reduction in alcohol consumption through enhanced
  treatment response'

description: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that any psychedelic therapy (LSD or
  psilocybin) enhanced odds of achieving abstinence or substantial reduction in alcohol consumption by
  2.16 times compared to placebo in double-blind trials. When inclusion criteria were relaxed, the odds
  ratio was 1.89 across 6 trials.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how regulatory restrictions on psychedelic research and
    treatment access create structural barriers to potentially effective AUD treatments. The historical
    gap in research (1970s to 2022) reflects policy decisions that limited investigation of these therapies.
    Expanding access to evidence-based psychedelic-assisted therapy requires policy reform at federal
    and state levels. Equity implications include differential access based on clinical trial availability,
    healthcare system engagement, and potential future insurance coverage disparities.
