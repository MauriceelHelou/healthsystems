direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alpha-1 antagonists (prazosin, doxazosin) are administered as pharmacotherapy for alcohol use
  disorder'
- 'Step 2: Alpha-1 receptor blockade reduces sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity associated with
  alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 3: Reduced noradrenergic signaling decreases stress-induced craving and arousal symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Attenuated physiological stress response reduces motivation to consume alcohol'
- 'Step 5: Decreased alcohol consumption improves clinical outcomes in alcohol use disorder'

description: Alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists prazosin and doxazosin significantly decrease alcohol consumption
  with a standardized mean difference of -0.32, representing a small to moderate effect. However, these
  medications did not significantly affect abstinence rates or heavy drinking days, suggesting they may
  be more effective for harm reduction than complete cessation.

  description: Alpha-1 antagonists showed significant effects on alcohol consumption (drinks per day/week)
    but no significant effect on abstinence or heavy drinking days, suggesting mechanism may work through
    consumption reduction rather than complete cessation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of expanding the pharmacotherapy toolkit
    for alcohol use disorder beyond traditional medications. Access to these treatments is mediated by
    healthcare access, insurance coverage, and prescriber awareness. Populations facing structural barriers
    to healthcare (uninsured, rural residents, marginalized communities) may have reduced access to emerging
    pharmacotherapy options. Additionally, the finding that this treatment reduces consumption without
    necessarily achieving abstinence supports harm reduction approaches, which face policy barriers in
    some jurisdictions.
