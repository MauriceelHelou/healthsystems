mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medical treatments (medications) are prescribed for various conditions'
- 'Step 2: Certain medications produce iatrogenic effects affecting brain chemistry and function'
- 'Step 3: These substance effects can induce symptoms of paedophilic disorder or impair behavioral control'
- 'Step 4: Medication-induced impairment affects self-determination and volitional capacity'
- 'Step 5: Forensic assessment must distinguish iatrogenic from idiopathic forms to determine criminal
  responsibility'

description: Iatrogenic (medication-induced) forms of paedophilic disorder represent cases where medical
  treatments significantly impair volitional and cognitive capacities. The paper argues for DSM criteria
  to distinguish symptoms not due to substance effects or medical conditions.

  description: Different medications may have varying propensity to affect impulse control and sexual
    behavior
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that the healthcare system itself can produce conditions
    affecting behavior through medication side effects. The structural implication is that individuals
    experiencing iatrogenic effects should not be held criminally responsible to the same degree, as their
    condition was induced by medical treatment rather than being inherent. This calls for structural reforms
    in both psychiatric diagnosis and forensic assessment.
