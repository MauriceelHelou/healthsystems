direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dental education programs provide insufficient training on treating patients with disabilities'
- 'Step 2: Dentists lack clinical skills and confidence to accommodate diverse physical, cognitive, and
  communication needs'
- 'Step 3: Practitioners may refuse to treat or provide inadequate care to patients with disabilities'
- 'Step 4: People with disabilities face reduced availability of competent dental providers'
- 'Step 5: Oral health access and utilization decreases among disability populations'

description: Systematic review identifying dentist lack of preparation to assist people with disabilities
  as a major barrier to dental care access. This structural gap in professional education creates downstream
  effects on care availability.

  variation_notes: The review notes that legal frameworks enabling access to dental care for people with
    disabilities vary by country and must be respected in each jurisdiction

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural failures in dental education systems and professional
    training requirements rather than individual dentist attitudes. The responsibility lies with educational
    institutions and licensing bodies to mandate adequate disability competency training. Equity implications
    are significant as people with disabilities already face multiple structural barriers to healthcare.
