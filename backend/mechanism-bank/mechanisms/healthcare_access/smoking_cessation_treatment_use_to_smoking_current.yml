  that access to effective smoking cessation treatments, particularly nicotine EC, can significantly reduce
  smoking prevalence at the population level when incorporated into healthcare and public health systems.

  equity_implications: 'Smoking cessation is fundamentally shaped by structural factors: tobacco industry
    practices, socioeconomic stress, regulatory policies on both combustible and alternative nicotine
    products, healthcare coverage, and community resources. Populations with highest smoking rates (low
    SES, certain racial/ethnic groups, LGBTQ+, those with mental health conditions) often face greatest
    barriers to cessation resources. Policy decisions about EC regulation have equity implications.'
