direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Federal waiver requirements create regulatory barriers for NPs/PAs to prescribe buprenorphine'
- 'Step 2: Waivered providers have different perceived barriers than non-waivered providers'
- 'Step 3: Waivered providers report insurance prior authorization and detoxification access as key barriers'
- 'Step 4: These structural healthcare system barriers limit buprenorphine prescribing even among waivered
  providers'
- 'Step 5: Reduced prescribing capacity leads to lower medication treatment rates for OUD patients'

description: Federal waiver requirements and associated structural barriers (insurance prior authorization,
  detoxification access) limit NP/PA buprenorphine prescribing capacity, contributing to underutilization
  of evidence-based medication treatment for OUD
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 240
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Buprenorphine is underutilized nationally, particularly in rural areas where NPs/PAs
    could help address treatment gaps
moderators:
- name: waiver_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Waivered versus non-waivered NPs/PAs perceive different barriers to prescribing, with non-waivered
    providers more concerned about patient mix
- name: rural_location
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Rural areas have greater underutilization of buprenorphine, making NP/PA prescribing more
    critical
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural healthcare policy barriers rather than individual
    provider deficits. The waiver system creates regulatory obstacles that differentially affect mid-level
    providers. Insurance prior authorization requirements and lack of detox beds are systemic healthcare
    infrastructure problems, not individual failures.
