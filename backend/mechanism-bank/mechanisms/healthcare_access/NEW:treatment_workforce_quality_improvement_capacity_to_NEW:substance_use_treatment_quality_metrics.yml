description: The study explicitly identifies workforce capacity limitations (lack of requisite experience
  or education in quality improvement methods) as a structural barrier to treatment quality, which the
  CARE intervention addresses through training and external facilitation.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural underinvestment in the substance use disorder
    treatment workforce creates systemic quality deficits. The framing explicitly avoids blaming individual
    providers, instead recognizing that workforce capacity is a system-level determinant of treatment
    quality.
