- 'Step 1: Primary care settings implement systematic screening for harmful/hazardous alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Early identification of at-risk individuals before development of severe alcohol-related disease'
- 'Step 3: Brief interventions provided to identified individuals reduce harmful consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases alcohol-attributable disease burden'
- 'Step 5: Prevention of alcohol-related morbidity reduces alcohol-induced mortality'

description: Primary care-based screening and brief intervention programs in LMIC can address the disproportionate

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses global health equity by focusing on structural determinants
    of alcohol-related health disparities between high-income and low/middle-income countries. The 'disproportionately
    higher alcohol-attributable disease burden' in LMIC reflects structural factors including lack of
    healthcare infrastructure, weak alcohol policies, and limited prevention resources. Implementing screening
    in primary care represents a structural intervention that can leverage existing healthcare touchpoints
    to address population-level alcohol harms. The focus on LMIC specifically highlights how global economic
    inequities produce differential health burdens.
