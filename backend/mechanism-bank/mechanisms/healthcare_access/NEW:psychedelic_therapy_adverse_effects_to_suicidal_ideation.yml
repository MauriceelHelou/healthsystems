description: One trial reported an instance of suicidal ideation as an adverse effect of psychedelic therapy,
  indicating the need for careful screening and monitoring protocols. This finding suggests the benefit-harm
  balance requires further exploration before widespread implementation.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Safety monitoring infrastructure and clinical protocols are structural determinants
    of safe psychedelic therapy delivery. Healthcare systems must develop appropriate screening tools
    and monitoring protocols to ensure equitable access to safe treatment. Populations with limited access
    to comprehensive mental health services may face greater risks from inadequate safety monitoring.
