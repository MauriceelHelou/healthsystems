mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Serotonergic psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, DMT) are administered in controlled therapeutic
  settings'
- 'Step 2: These substances act on serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, inducing neuroplastic changes'
- 'Step 3: Therapeutic sessions with psychological support facilitate cognitive and emotional processing'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience reduction in depressive symptoms'

description: This living systematic review and meta-analysis examined serotonergic psychedelics and MDMA
  for treating mental disorders including depression. The review included 30 RCTs with 1480 participants,
  though the abstract specifically reports PTSD outcomes for MDMA. The majority of trials included psychological
  support and showed promising results for treating mental disorders.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to psychedelic-assisted therapies represents emerging healthcare infrastructure
    that is unevenly distributed. Current drug scheduling policies create structural barriers to both
    research and clinical access. Populations with treatment-resistant depression often face multiple
    intersecting barriers including cost, geographic access to specialized treatment centers, and insurance
    coverage limitations. The requirement for psychological support (83.3% of trials) indicates these
    are resource-intensive interventions that may exacerbate existing healthcare disparities if not deliberately
    made accessible across socioeconomic strata.
