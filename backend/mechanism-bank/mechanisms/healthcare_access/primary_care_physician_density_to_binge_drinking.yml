direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher primary care physician density increases population access to primary care encounters'
- 'Step 2: More primary care encounters create more opportunities for alcohol screening'
- 'Step 3: Screening identifies individuals with hazardous/harmful drinking who would not otherwise seek
  help'
- 'Step 4: Brief interventions delivered at primary care encounters reduce alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Population-level reduction in binge drinking through increased healthcare access'

description: The effectiveness of brief interventions for alcohol demonstrated in this review is contingent
  on access to primary care settings where screening occurs. Primary care physician density serves as
  a structural determinant of whether populations can access evidence-based alcohol interventions.

  description: Populations in primary care shortage areas have reduced access to the screening and brief
    intervention infrastructure that produces these effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare infrastructure distribution creates inequitable
    access to evidence-based alcohol interventions. Communities with primary care shortages cannot benefit
    from screening and brief intervention even when such interventions are proven effective. This represents
    a structural pathway through which healthcare resource allocation decisions create differential health
    outcomes across geographic areas and populations.
