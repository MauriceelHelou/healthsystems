  node_name: AUD Pharmacotherapy Receipt Rate
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients develop alcohol-attributable medical conditions as a consequence of AUD'
- 'Step 2: Medical comorbidities may shift clinical focus toward acute medical management rather than
  addiction treatment'
- 'Step 3: Specialist care silos may separate addiction treatment from medical management'
- 'Step 4: Prescribers in specialist care settings may feel uncertain about initiating AUD medications'
- 'Step 5: Structural barriers result in paradoxically lower AUD treatment rates among those with greatest
  medical need'

description: Across all categories of alcohol-attributable medical diagnoses, patients in specialist care
  with AUD and comorbidities receive significantly less pharmacotherapy than those without comorbidities,
  representing systematic underutilization of evidence-based treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This overarching pattern demonstrates a fundamental structural inequity in healthcare
    delivery: the paradox of inverse care where those with greatest medical complexity and need receive
    least access to effective treatment. The findings call for systemic interventions including better
    integration of addiction medicine into specialist care, clearer clinical guidelines for complex patients,
    and policy reforms to address prescriber barriers. The undertreatment cannot be attributed to patient
    factors but represents healthcare system failure that perpetuates health inequities and preventable
    morbidity and mortality.'
