- 'Step 1: Mass media campaigns raise awareness about alcohol problems and available treatment'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with problematic drinking become aware of treatment options'

description: Mass media campaigns show some evidence of increasing treatment seeking and information seeking
  behaviors related to alcohol. This represents a potential pathway to harm reduction through connecting
  individuals with services.

  variation_notes: Developed country contexts where treatment services are available; effect depends on
    treatment infrastructure

  description: Treatment seeking can only increase where treatment services are accessible and available
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While increasing treatment seeking is positive, this mechanism still operates at
    the individual level. Structural barriers to treatment access (cost, availability, stigma, geographic
    access) must be addressed alongside awareness campaigns. Treatment-focused campaigns are more structurally
    sound when paired with policy interventions ensuring treatment accessibility for all populations.
