mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic conditions persist over extended periods, often decades'
- 'Step 2: Long-term conditions generate sequelae (complications and secondary conditions)'
- 'Step 3: Sequelae from chronic conditions account for 93% of YLDs, indicating cumulative disability
  burden'
- 'Step 4: Overall chronic conditions represent 86% of all YLDs globally'

description: Chronic conditions are responsible for 86% of Years Lived with Disability globally, with
  sequelae from chronic conditions accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae, demonstrating the overwhelming
  contribution of chronic disease to population disability burden.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The dominance of chronic conditions in disability burden reflects structural failures
    in prevention, early intervention, and disease management systems. Populations without access to comprehensive
    chronic disease management bear disproportionate disability burdens. This is not about individual
    compliance but about health system design and resource allocation priorities.
