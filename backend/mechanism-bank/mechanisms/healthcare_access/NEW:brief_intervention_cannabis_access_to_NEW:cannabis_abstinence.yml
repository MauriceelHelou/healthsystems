direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief interventions provide accessible, low-barrier substance use support'
- 'Step 2: Motivational approaches support autonomous decision-making about cannabis use'
- 'Step 3: Single-session delivery eliminates need for ongoing healthcare engagement'
- 'Step 4: Intervention targets emerging adults during developmentally critical period'
- 'Step 5: Increased likelihood of achieving cannabis abstinence at follow-up'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding has equity implications as brief interventions can be delivered in
    diverse settings, potentially reaching populations with limited access to traditional substance use
    treatment. The focus on non-treatment-seeking populations acknowledges structural barriers that prevent
    many young adults from accessing formal treatment. However, the low quality of evidence and limited
    attention to concurrent psychiatric conditions suggests gaps in addressing co-occurring structural
    vulnerabilities.
