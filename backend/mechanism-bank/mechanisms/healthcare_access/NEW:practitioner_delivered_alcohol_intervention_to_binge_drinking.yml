  description: Effect attenuates from 1 month to 6 months, with smaller but still significant reduction
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The diminishing but persistent effect at 6 months suggests that sustained access
    to practitioner support is important for maintaining behavior change. Healthcare systems that provide
    continuity of care may achieve better outcomes. Structural barriers to follow-up care (transportation,
    cost, availability) may contribute to effect attenuation.
