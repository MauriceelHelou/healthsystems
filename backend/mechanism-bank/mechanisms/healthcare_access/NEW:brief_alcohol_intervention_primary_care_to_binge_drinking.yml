  risks'

description: Brief alcohol interventions delivered in primary care settings reduce alcohol consumption
  by approximately 20 grams per week compared to minimal or no intervention. This represents a structural
  healthcare intervention that leverages routine healthcare encounters to address hazardous drinking before
  it progresses to alcohol use disorder.

  description: Subgroup analysis demonstrated that both men and women reduced alcohol consumption after
    receiving brief intervention, confirming effectiveness across genders
- name: setting_type

  strength: moderate
  description: Interventions delivered in general practice (55%) and emergency care (39%) settings showed
    effectiveness, indicating structural healthcare access points matter
- name: intervention_duration
  direction: weakens
  strength: weak
  description: Extended interventions (>60 minutes) showed no greater impact than brief interventions,
    suggesting diminishing returns with longer counseling duration
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare system design and primary care infrastructure
    can serve as a population-level intervention point. The effectiveness of brief interventions depends
    on universal access to primary care and emergency services, highlighting how healthcare access disparities
    may create differential exposure to this protective intervention. Populations with limited primary
    care access may miss opportunities for early intervention, perpetuating health inequities related
    to alcohol harm.
