- 'Step 1: Pregnant individuals with OUD receive buprenorphine-naloxone combination treatment'
- 'Step 2: Stable medication treatment supports improved maternal health and nutrition during pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Reduced illicit opioid use and associated lifestyle factors that impair fetal growth'
- 'Step 4: Improved placental function and fetal nutrient delivery'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of growth-restricted infants at birth'

description: Prenatal buprenorphine-naloxone exposure was associated with a 14% lower risk of small for
  gestational age births compared to buprenorphine alone (absolute risk 10.0% vs 12.4%).

  equity_implications: Small for gestational age is associated with long-term developmental and health
    consequences. Having flexible treatment options for pregnant individuals with OUD supports structural
    efforts to improve birth outcomes in this high-risk population. Treatment flexibility removes barriers
    that may lead to treatment discontinuation.
