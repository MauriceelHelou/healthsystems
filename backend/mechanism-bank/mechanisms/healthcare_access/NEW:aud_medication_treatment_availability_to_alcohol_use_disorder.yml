mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FDA-approved medications (disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate) are available but underutilized
  in healthcare systems'
- 'Step 2: Provider barriers including stigma, lack of knowledge, and lack of professional support limit
  prescribing'
- 'Step 3: Shortage of willing providers creates treatment access gaps'
- 'Step 4: When medications are prescribed, they reduce alcohol craving, block rewarding effects, or create
  aversive reactions'
- 'Step 5: Reduced medication access perpetuates AUD prevalence and severity'

description: FDA-approved medications for AUD (disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate) are effective but
  severely underutilized due to systemic healthcare barriers including provider stigma, knowledge gaps,
  lack of professional support, and shortage of willing providers. This represents a structural failure
  in healthcare delivery that perpetuates AUD burden.

  variation_notes: Provider availability and willingness to prescribe AUD medications likely varies by
    region, healthcare system, and practice setting

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system failures - not individual patient
    factors - drive AUD treatment gaps. Provider stigma reflects broader societal stigma institutionalized
    in medical practice. Shortage of willing providers is a workforce and training system issue. The focus
    on underutilization shifts blame from patients to structural barriers in healthcare delivery.
