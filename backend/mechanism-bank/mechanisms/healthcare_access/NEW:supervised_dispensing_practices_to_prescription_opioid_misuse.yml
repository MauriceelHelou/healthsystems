mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prisons implement supervised dispensing protocols for opioid medications'
- 'Step 2: Direct observation aims to ensure medication is swallowed rather than retained'
- 'Step 3: Despite supervision, diversion still occurs through techniques like cheek retention of tablets'
- 'Step 4: Widespread supervised dispensing reduces but does not eliminate abuse risk'

description: Supervised dispensing is a standard practice to prevent medication diversion, but the review
  found that abuse risk remains significant despite these protocols, indicating structural limitations
  of this intervention alone.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Implementation and effectiveness of supervised dispensing varies across different prison
    systems and countries

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that procedural controls within carceral healthcare
    systems have limitations. The persistence of diversion despite supervision points to the need for
    multi-level interventions including medication formulation changes and addressing underlying addiction
    treatment needs in carceral settings. The structural environment of prisons creates unique challenges
    that cannot be solved through surveillance alone.
