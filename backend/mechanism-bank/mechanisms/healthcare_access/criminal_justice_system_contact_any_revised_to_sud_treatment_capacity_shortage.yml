direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Justice settings have significant structural barriers to providing evidence-based substance
  use treatment'
- 'Step 2: Limited treatment infrastructure within jails, prisons, and community supervision systems'
- 'Step 3: Polysubstance use complicates treatment protocols and requires more comprehensive services
  often unavailable'
- 'Step 4: Treatment access barriers persist during incarceration and upon reentry to community'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies structural barriers within the criminal justice system
    that prevent adequate substance use treatment. Rather than blaming individuals for treatment failure,
    it highlights systemic inadequacies in healthcare provision within carceral settings. The mechanism
    has clear equity implications as criminal justice-involved populations are disproportionately from
    marginalized communities.
