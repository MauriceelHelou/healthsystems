direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare policy determines whether peripheral venous catheters are replaced on a fixed schedule
  (every 72-96 hours) or only when clinically indicated'
- 'Step 2: Clinically-indicated replacement allows catheters to remain in place longer when functioning
  without signs of complications'
- 'Step 3: Potential for bacterial colonization and biofilm formation exists regardless of replacement
  schedule'
- 'Step 4: No significant difference in bloodstream infection rates detected between policies due to low
  baseline incidence'

description: Clinically-indicated catheter replacement compared to routine 72-96 hour replacement shows
  no clear difference in catheter-related bloodstream infections (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.08-4.68), with very
  low event rates (1/3590 vs 2/3733)

  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare system policy decisions affecting patient
    care protocols. Current CDC guidelines recommend routine replacement, but evidence suggests this may
    be unnecessary, imposing systemic costs and patient discomfort without demonstrated benefit. Policy
    change could reduce healthcare resource utilization.
