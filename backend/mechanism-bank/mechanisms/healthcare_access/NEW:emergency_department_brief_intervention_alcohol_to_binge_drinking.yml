mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency department visit creates a ''teachable moment'' when patients may be more receptive
  to behavior change messaging'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol screening identifies at-risk drinkers who may not have been previously identified in
  healthcare settings'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention provides structured counseling addressing alcohol-related harms and motivational
  strategies'
- 'Step 4: Patients receive personalized feedback on their drinking patterns and associated health risks'
- 'Step 5: Very small reductions in alcohol consumption quantity occur following intervention'

description: Emergency department-based alcohol screening with brief interventions produces very small
  but statistically significant reductions in alcohol consumption among injured and/or intoxicated patients.
  The highest effect observed was SMD of 0.19, representing a small effect size. Six of nine outcome comparisons
  across different time points and consumption measures showed significant effects favoring brief intervention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare system capacity to identify and intervene with
    at-risk drinkers during opportunistic healthcare encounters. Emergency departments represent a critical
    touchpoint for reaching populations who may lack regular primary care access. However, the very small
    effect sizes raise questions about whether widespread ED-based screening and brief intervention implementation
    is the most efficient use of limited healthcare resources. Structural factors influencing alcohol
    use (economic stress, neighborhood alcohol outlet density, housing instability) are not addressed
    by individual-level brief interventions. The findings suggest that while ED-based interventions may
    provide marginal benefit, they do not address upstream determinants of harmful alcohol use patterns.
