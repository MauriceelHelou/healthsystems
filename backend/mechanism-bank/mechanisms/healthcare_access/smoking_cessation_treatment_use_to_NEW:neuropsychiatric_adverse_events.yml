- 'Step 1: Access to smoking cessation medicines (varenicline, bupropion, NRT, e-cigarettes) enables quit
  attempts'
- 'Step 2: Pharmacological agents act on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 3: Alterations in dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways may produce neuropsychiatric effects'
- 'Step 4: Some patients experience serious adverse events including psychiatric symptoms requiring hospitalization'

description: This protocol outlines a systematic review to compare neuropsychiatric safety of smoking
  cessation medicines. The primary outcome is serious adverse events (death, life-threatening events,
  hospitalization, significant disability). The study will examine whether structural access to these
  medicines through healthcare systems carries differential risks.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Public health guidance recommending specific cessation medicines creates structural
    pathways to medication access. Safety concerns may differentially affect populations with pre-existing
    mental health conditions or limited healthcare access for monitoring. The protocol aims to inform
    equitable prescribing guidelines.
