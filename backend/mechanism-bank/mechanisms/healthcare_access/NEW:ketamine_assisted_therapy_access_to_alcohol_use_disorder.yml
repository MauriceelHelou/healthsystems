mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ketamine administration modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission via NMDA receptor antagonism'
- 'Step 2: Glutamatergic modulation reduces alcohol withdrawal symptoms and craving'
- 'Step 3: Reduced withdrawal severity decreases benzodiazepine requirements for detoxification'
- 'Step 4: Improved withdrawal management supports sustained abstinence from alcohol'

description: Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, reduces alcohol withdrawal symptoms and benzodiazepine
  requirements in patients with Alcohol Use Disorder through glutamatergic neurotransmission modulation.
  This systematic review found evidence of short-term benefits, though evidence is limited by small sample
  sizes and lack of randomized trials.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to ketamine-assisted therapy represents a structural healthcare access issue.
    Treatment availability may be limited by regulatory barriers, cost, specialist availability, and healthcare
    system capacity. Equitable access to novel SUD treatments is essential to address alcohol-related
    health disparities, particularly in underserved communities with limited addiction medicine resources.
