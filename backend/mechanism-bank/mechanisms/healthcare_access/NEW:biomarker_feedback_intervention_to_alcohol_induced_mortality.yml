mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems implement biomarker-based screening and advice in routine alcohol care'
- 'Step 2: Early identification of liver injury through biomarkers enables timely intervention'
- 'Step 3: Personalized advice based on objective evidence promotes sustained reduction in harmful drinking'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption prevents progression of alcohol-related liver disease and other
  conditions'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of alcohol-attributed mortality in intervention populations'

description: Non-intervention groups showed higher incidence of alcohol-attributed mortality compared
  to groups receiving biomarker-based advice, demonstrating the life-saving potential of integrating this
  intervention into routine care.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system capacity and protocols directly
    impact mortality outcomes. The structural determinant is whether healthcare systems have the infrastructure,
    training, and resources to implement biomarker screening and counseling. Populations with limited
    healthcare access may not benefit from this intervention, potentially widening health disparities
    in alcohol-related mortality.
