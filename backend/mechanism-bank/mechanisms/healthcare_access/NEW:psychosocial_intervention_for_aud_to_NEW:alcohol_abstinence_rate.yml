direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with moderate to severe AUD receive psychosocial interventions (e.g., cognitive
  behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, contingency management)'
- 'Step 2: Interventions address psychological, behavioral, and social factors contributing to alcohol
  dependence'
- 'Step 3: Participants develop coping strategies, motivation for change, and behavioral skills to avoid
  alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Increased likelihood of achieving and maintaining abstinence from alcohol'

description: Psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder increase the relative risk of achieving
  abstinence by 28% compared to treatment-as-usual (NNT=9), though they do not significantly reduce drinking
  frequency or amount among those who continue drinking

  description: 71.5% of participants were men, which may reflect both the higher prevalence of AUD in
    men and potential differences in treatment response by sex

  description: 13 of 14 studies used ICD 10/DSM-IV diagnosis, suggesting effects are robust for clinically
    diagnosed alcohol dependence
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of healthcare system capacity to deliver
    psychosocial interventions for AUD. Access barriers (mental health provider shortages, lack of insurance
    coverage for behavioral health, geographic maldistribution of treatment facilities) create structural
    inequities in who can benefit from these evidence-based treatments. The finding that interventions
    improve abstinence but not harm reduction outcomes suggests policy implications for how AUD treatment
    success is defined and measured.
