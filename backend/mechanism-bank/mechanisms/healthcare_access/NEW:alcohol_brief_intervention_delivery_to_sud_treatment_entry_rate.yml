mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with diagnosed alcohol use disorder receive brief intervention in primary care'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention provides advice to reduce or abstain from alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Despite having a clinical diagnosis indicating need for specialty treatment, BI may substitute
  for rather than supplement referral'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system treats BI as an endpoint rather than a step in stepped care model'
- 'Step 5: Patients with AUD experience reduced likelihood of receiving appropriate specialty treatment'

description: Among patients with documented alcohol use disorder diagnosis, brief intervention was associated
  with a 17% reduction in receiving specialty addictions treatment, suggesting the intervention may paradoxically
  reduce access to appropriate care for those with diagnosed disorders.

  equity_implications: This finding is particularly concerning from a structural competency perspective
    because it demonstrates how a well-intentioned healthcare intervention designed as part of a stepped
    care model may actually function as a barrier to necessary specialty care for patients with diagnosed
    disorders. The system design assumes BI leads to specialty referral when needed, but the data suggest
    the opposite occurs. This represents a failure of healthcare system design rather than individual
    patient engagement.
