  equity_implications: This finding suggests that current evidence-based psychosocial treatments are more
    effective at promoting abstinence than reducing consumption intensity. Policy and treatment guidelines
    that only support abstinence-focused approaches may fail to serve populations who would benefit from
    harm reduction. This creates structural barriers for individuals with AUD who seek moderation rather
    than abstinence.
