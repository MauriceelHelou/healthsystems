mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care providers receive training on alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy and access
  to on-call addiction medicine video consultations'
- 'Step 2: Telemedicine consultations reduce barriers to specialty knowledge by providing immediate access
  to addiction medicine expertise'
- 'Step 3: PCPs gain confidence and practical guidance to prescribe FDA-approved AUD medications like
  naltrexone'
- 'Step 4: Increased prescribing of AUD pharmacotherapy (naltrexone) leads to higher medication treatment
  rates for patients with AUD'

description: Patients who received telemedicine addiction medicine consultations had significantly higher
  naltrexone prescription rates (34.4%) compared to non-recipients (6.4%, p<0.0001). This demonstrates
  that telemedicine consultation services can dramatically increase AUD pharmacotherapy adoption in primary
  care settings.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to AUD treatment including lack of
    addiction medicine specialists in primary care, limited PCP training in AUD pharmacotherapy, and fragmented
    care systems. By embedding specialty consultation within primary care via telemedicine, the intervention
    addresses healthcare system inadequacies rather than blaming patients for not seeking specialty treatment.
    The low baseline prescription rate (6.4%) reflects systemic undertreatment of AUD.
