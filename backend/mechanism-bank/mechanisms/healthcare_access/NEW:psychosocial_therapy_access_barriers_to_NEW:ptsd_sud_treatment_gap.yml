direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychosocial therapies are currently the only specifically recommended treatments for co-occurring
  PTSD and SUD'
- 'Step 2: These therapies face numerous structural barriers to access including availability, cost, time
  requirements, and workforce shortages'
- 'Step 3: Engagement barriers include stigma, transportation, scheduling conflicts, and treatment complexity'
- 'Step 4: Limited treatment options result in untreated or undertreated co-occurring conditions with
  worse outcomes'

description: The review identifies that currently only psychosocial therapies are specifically recommended
  for co-occurring PTSD and SUD, but these face 'numerous barriers to access and engagement.' This creates
  a treatment gap that pharmacological options could help address.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Access barriers likely vary significantly by geography, with rural areas having fewer
    mental health and addiction specialists, and civilian populations having different access patterns
    than veterans with VA healthcare

  description: Civilian populations may face greater access barriers than veterans who have access to
    VA healthcare system; review calls for more civilian-focused research

  strength: moderate
  description: Review notes majority of studies focused on alcohol use disorders, with less evidence for
    other SUDs potentially reflecting treatment system gaps
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system inadequacy as a structural determinant
    of health outcomes. The treatment gap is not due to individual non-compliance but to systemic barriers
    in treatment availability and accessibility. The review explicitly calls for expanded pharmacological
    options to address these structural barriers, recognizing that relying solely on therapy-based approaches
    creates inequitable access.
