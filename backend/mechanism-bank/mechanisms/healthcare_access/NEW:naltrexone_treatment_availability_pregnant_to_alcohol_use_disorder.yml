mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited availability of naltrexone prescribers willing to treat pregnant patients (only 35.9%
  of responding sites)'
- 'Step 2: Geographic variation creates treatment deserts, particularly outside the Northeast US'
- 'Step 3: Pregnant individuals with AUD face barriers to accessing evidence-based pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or undertreated AUD during pregnancy leads to worse maternal and fetal outcomes'

description: This survey of naltrexone prescribers found that only 35.9% of sites offered naltrexone for
  pregnant individuals with alcohol use disorder or opioid use disorder. Major barriers included absence
  of pregnant patients at sites (15.6%), lack of national guidelines (14.1%), provider safety concerns
  (9.4%), and provider inexperience (4.7%).

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights structural healthcare access barriers rather than individual
    patient factors. The limited availability of naltrexone treatment for pregnant individuals reflects
    systemic gaps including: 1) lack of policy guidance through national treatment guidelines, 2) inadequate
    provider training and education on pregnancy-specific treatment, 3) geographic maldistribution of
    services creating treatment deserts. These structural factors disproportionately affect pregnant individuals
    in regions outside the Northeast, creating geographic inequities in access to evidence-based SUD treatment.
    The absence of comprehensive guidelines leaves individual providers to make decisions without institutional
    support, perpetuating treatment gaps.'
