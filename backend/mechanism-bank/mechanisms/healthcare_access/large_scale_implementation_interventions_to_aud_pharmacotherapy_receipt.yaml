direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Large-scale implementation interventions modify system-wide policies and
  practices across multiple treatment sites'
- 'Step 2: System-level changes reach all patients treated at participating sites,
  not just those recruited for studies'
- 'Step 3: Broader implementation addresses organizational and provider-level barriers
  to medication prescribing'
- 'Step 4: Increased availability and provider willingness to prescribe leads to increased
  patient receipt of pharmacotherapy'
