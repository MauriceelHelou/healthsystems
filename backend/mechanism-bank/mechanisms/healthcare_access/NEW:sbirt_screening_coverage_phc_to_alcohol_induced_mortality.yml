description: The paper's modeling suggests that large-scale SBIRT implementation in primary health care
  can substantially reduce population-level alcohol consumption (by 12% at 50% screening coverage), which
  would be expected to reduce alcohol-attributable harm and mortality. The study notes that Germany has
  high levels of alcohol consumption and attributable harm, making this intervention particularly relevant.
  The authors emphasize that other effective alcohol policies are needed for short-term harm reduction.

  variation_notes: Study conducted in Germany where high levels of alcohol consumption and attributable
    harm exist; effects would vary based on baseline consumption levels and healthcare system capacity
    in other countries

    mortality impact
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism positions healthcare system capacity and policy as structural determinants
    of alcohol-related mortality. The current 2.9% screening rate in Germany represents a structural barrier
    to population health improvement. The need for complementary policy approaches (beyond clinical intervention)
    underscores that individual-level healthcare alone cannot address the structural and cultural factors
    driving alcohol harm. The open-access simulation model itself is a tool for evidence-based policy
    making at the structural level.
