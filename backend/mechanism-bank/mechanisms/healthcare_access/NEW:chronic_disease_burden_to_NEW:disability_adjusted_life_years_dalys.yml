mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, mental disorders) accumulate
  over time requiring long-term management'
- 'Step 2: Health systems designed primarily for acute care are structurally unprepared to manage progressive,
  long-term conditions'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate chronic care infrastructure leads to disease progression and complications'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated chronic disease burden contributes 68% of global DALYs, reflecting both premature
  mortality and disability'

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism identifies a fundamental structural problem: health systems globally
    were designed around acute care models but face chronic disease epidemics. The inequity is structural
    - populations with less developed health systems and lower socio-demographic indices face disproportionate
    chronic disease burden without adequate care infrastructure. Policy solutions require health system
    transformation, not individual behavior change.'
