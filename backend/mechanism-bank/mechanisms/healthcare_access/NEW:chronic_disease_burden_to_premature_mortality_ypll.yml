description: Chronic conditions requiring long-term management contribute 71% of Years of Life Lost (YLL)
  globally, indicating that premature mortality is predominantly driven by conditions that require sustained,
  system-level interventions rather than acute care responses.

  description: Chronic conditions increase with age, contributing to mortality burden
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The high proportion of YLL attributable to chronic conditions reflects structural
    underinvestment in chronic disease prevention and management infrastructure. Populations in lower-resourced
    settings face both higher chronic disease burden and fewer resources for management, creating compounding
    inequities. Solutions require structural transformation of health systems toward chronic care capacity.
