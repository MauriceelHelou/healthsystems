direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinically-indicated replacement policy reduces frequency of unnecessary catheter changes'
- 'Step 2: Fewer replacement procedures means reduced supply consumption (catheters, dressings, flush
  solutions)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced nursing time spent on unnecessary procedures'
- 'Step 4: Aggregate cost savings at healthcare system level'

description: Clinically-indicated removal probably reduces device-related costs by approximately AUD 7.00
  per patient compared with routine removal (MD -6.96, 95% CI -9.05 to -4.86)

    value: -6.96

  sample_size: 4244
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This represents a structural healthcare policy mechanism with significant resource
    allocation implications. Cost savings from clinically-indicated replacement could be redirected to
    other healthcare needs. The economic burden of routine replacement policies falls on healthcare systems
    and ultimately patients.
