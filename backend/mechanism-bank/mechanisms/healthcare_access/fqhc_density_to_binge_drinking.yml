direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of primary care facilities (including FQHCs) increases population access to
  healthcare'
- 'Step 2: Routine healthcare visits create opportunities for alcohol screening and brief intervention'
- 'Step 3: Brief interventions in primary care settings are effective at reducing alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Population-level exposure to screening and intervention reduces hazardous drinking patterns'
- 'Step 5: Decreased binge drinking frequency and intensity across communities with better primary care
  access'

description: The availability of primary care infrastructure, including general practice and community
  health centers, creates structural opportunities for population-level alcohol screening and brief intervention
  delivery. This mechanism links healthcare access to reduced hazardous drinking through systematic screening
  and intervention programs.

  description: General practice settings accounted for 55% of studies, demonstrating that primary care
    infrastructure is a key delivery platform for alcohol interventions

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare infrastructure disparities translate into
    differential alcohol-related health outcomes. Communities with primary care shortages may have reduced
    exposure to evidence-based brief interventions, perpetuating health inequities. Policy investments
    in primary care density could serve as upstream interventions to reduce alcohol-related harm at the
    population level.
