- 'Step 1: Brief interventions delivered during healthcare encounters aim to screen for and address cannabis
  use'
- 'Step 2: ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test) used to measure cannabis-specific
  risk'
- 'Step 3: Interventions intended to reduce cannabis involvement and associated harms'
- 'Step 4: Expected decrease in ASSIST scores indicating lower risk cannabis use patterns'
- 'Step 5: Results show no significant effect on ASSIST scores despite intervention'

description: Brief interventions in healthcare settings showed no significant effect on reducing cannabis-specific
  ASSIST scores in the short term (MD -1.27 points; 95% CI -3.75, 1.21). The very high heterogeneity (I²=84.4%)
  indicates substantial variation across studies. This null finding challenges the assumption that brief
  intervention approaches effective for alcohol can be directly applied to cannabis use.

  description: Very high heterogeneity (I²=84.4%) indicates substantial inconsistency across studies,
    weakening confidence in pooled estimate
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The high heterogeneity suggests that effectiveness may vary substantially based
    on structural factors including healthcare system characteristics, population demographics, and social
    context. This underscores that individual-level clinical interventions operate within structural constraints
    that may limit their effectiveness. A health equity approach would consider how cannabis use patterns
    are shaped by social determinants (economic opportunity, neighborhood environment, stress exposure)
    that brief clinical encounters cannot modify.
