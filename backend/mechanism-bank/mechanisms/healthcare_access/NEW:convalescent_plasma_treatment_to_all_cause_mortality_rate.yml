mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Convalescent plasma contains antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients'
- 'Step 2: Passive immunization transfers neutralizing antibodies to active patients'
- 'Step 3: Antibodies may help neutralize SARS-CoV-2 viral particles'
- 'Step 4: Reduced viral load could theoretically prevent severe disease progression'
- 'Step 5: However, meta-analysis found no significant mortality reduction (RR 0.93-1.02)'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (4 peer-reviewed, 6 preprints/press releases)
  including 11,782 total patients found convalescent plasma treatment was not significantly associated
  with reduced all-cause mortality compared to placebo or standard care. The summary RR from peer-reviewed
  RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI 0.63-1.38) and from all RCTs was 1.02 (95% CI 0.92-1.12).

  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare access and therapeutic intervention availability
    during a pandemic. While not directly addressing structural determinants of health inequity, access
    to experimental treatments like convalescent plasma during COVID-19 was influenced by healthcare system
    capacity, hospital resources, and geographic location. The null finding has equity implications as
    it suggests resources should be directed toward proven interventions rather than unproven therapies.
