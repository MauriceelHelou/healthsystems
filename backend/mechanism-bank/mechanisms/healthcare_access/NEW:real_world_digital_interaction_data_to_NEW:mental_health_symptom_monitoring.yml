  equity_implications: While data-driven monitoring offers clinical benefits, it raises structural concerns
    about surveillance, data ownership, and algorithmic bias. Marginalized populations may face greater
    privacy risks or algorithmic discrimination. Implementation must include robust privacy protections
    and equity audits of ML models.
