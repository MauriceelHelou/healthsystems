mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low- and middle-income countries experience severe shortages of professional mental health
  workers'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare systems respond by developing task-shifting strategies'
- 'Step 3: Lay community members are identified and professionally trained in mental health interventions'
- 'Step 4: Task-shifting model enables mental health service delivery where professionals are unavailable'

description: The rationale for studying lay counsellor interventions stems from recognized shortages of
  professional mental health workers, medical professionals, and community health workers in study countries.
  This structural constraint necessitates innovative service delivery models.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Workforce shortages vary across low- and middle-income countries, driving different
    levels of task-shifting implementation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly identifies workforce maldistribution as a structural
    determinant of mental health care access. The global mental health workforce is concentrated in high-income
    countries, creating systematic inequities. Task-shifting is a structural response to structural inequity
    rather than a behavioral intervention.
