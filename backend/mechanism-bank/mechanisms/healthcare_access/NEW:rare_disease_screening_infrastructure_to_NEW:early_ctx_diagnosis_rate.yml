- 'Step 1: Investment in broader screening programs increases detection of CYP27A1 mutations'
- 'Step 2: Earlier identification of CTX patients before symptom onset or progression'
- 'Step 3: Timely initiation of chenodiol therapy while disease is still modifiable'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of cholestanol accumulation and subsequent tissue damage'
- 'Step 5: Improved long-term neurological and clinical outcomes'

description: Broader screening infrastructure for rare lipid storage diseases enables earlier diagnosis
  of CTX, allowing treatment initiation before irreversible neurological damage occurs, which the paper
  identifies as critical for achieving lasting clinical benefit.

  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes that clinical outcomes for rare diseases are structurally
    determined by screening infrastructure availability. The paper explicitly calls for 'broader screening'
    as key to improving outcomes, recognizing that individual patient outcomes depend on system-level
    investments. Geographic and socioeconomic disparities in rare disease screening capacity create inequitable
    access to early diagnosis, disadvantaging patients in under-resourced areas or healthcare systems
    without specialized genetic testing capabilities.
