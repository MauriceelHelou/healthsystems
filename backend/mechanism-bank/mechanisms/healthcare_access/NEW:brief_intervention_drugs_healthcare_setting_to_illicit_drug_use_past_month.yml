- 'Step 1: Healthcare settings screen for drug use among patients presenting for other medical concerns'

  use'
- 'Step 3: Small improvements observed in multiple drug/mixed substance use outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Limited evidence suggests modest reductions in overall drug use patterns'

description: Drug-targeted brief interventions in healthcare settings yielded significant but small improvements
  in multiple drug/mixed substance use. However, evidence for effects specifically on drug use outcomes
  remains limited, suggesting the need for more tailored approaches.

  description: Drug-targeted interventions showed limited evidence compared to alcohol-targeted interventions

  equity_implications: The limited effectiveness of drug-targeted brief interventions compared to alcohol
    interventions may reflect structural differences in how these substances are addressed in healthcare
    systems, including stigma, criminalization of drug use, and lack of integrated treatment pathways.
    This finding points to the need for systemic changes in how healthcare systems approach drug use,
    including decriminalization efforts and integration of harm reduction services.
