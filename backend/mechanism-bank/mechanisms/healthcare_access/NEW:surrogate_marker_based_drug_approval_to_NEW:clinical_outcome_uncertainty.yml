- 'Step 1: FDA approves drugs for nononcologic chronic diseases based on surrogate markers (e.g., blood
  pressure, HbA1c, cholesterol) as primary endpoints'
- 'Step 2: Systematic review finds only 41% of surrogate markers (15 of 37) have any published meta-analysis
  examining association with clinical outcomes'
- 'Step 3: Among those with meta-analyses, only 17% (10 of 59) showed high-strength correlation (r≥0.85
  or R²≥0.72) with clinical outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Patients receive treatments with uncertain benefit for meaningful clinical outcomes (mortality,
  morbidity, quality of life)'

description: This systematic review reveals that most surrogate markers used for FDA drug approval in
  nononcologic chronic diseases lack high-strength evidence of association with clinical outcomes. Of
  37 surrogate markers examined, only 15 (41%) had any meta-analysis evidence, and among those with correlation
  data, only 17% showed high-strength associations. This creates structural uncertainty in healthcare
  where treatments may modify surrogate markers without delivering meaningful clinical benefits to patients.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exposes a structural problem in pharmaceutical regulation and healthcare
    delivery. The reliance on surrogate markers in drug approval creates a system where patients with
    chronic diseases may receive treatments that fail to improve actual health outcomes. This has equity
    implications as vulnerable populations with less access to information or alternative treatments may
    be disproportionately affected by treatments that modify biomarkers without clinical benefit. The
    structural issue lies in regulatory frameworks that allow market access based on incomplete evidence
    of clinical efficacy.
