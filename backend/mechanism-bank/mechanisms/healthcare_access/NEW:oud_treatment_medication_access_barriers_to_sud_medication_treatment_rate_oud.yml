direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural barriers including stigma, cost, transportation, and service availability limit
  initial access to OUD treatment medications'
- 'Step 2: Patients face challenges navigating healthcare systems to initiate medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 3: Complex regulatory requirements and limited provider availability reduce medication initiation
  rates'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment initiation leads to lower overall OUD medication treatment rates'

description: Systematic review of 47 qualitative studies identified barriers to access as a major theme
  affecting patient experience of OUD treatment medications, with structural factors limiting medication
  initiation rates

  variation_notes: Review included studies from community and criminal justice settings, suggesting geographic
    and institutional variation in access barriers

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces treatment access barriers to structural factors including
    healthcare system design, regulatory frameworks, and social stigma rather than individual patient
    motivation. The review explicitly endorses patient-centered care and clinically integrated services
    as structural solutions.
