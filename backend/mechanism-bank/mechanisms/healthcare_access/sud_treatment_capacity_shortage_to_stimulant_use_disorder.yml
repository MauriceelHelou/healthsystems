- 'Step 1: Lack of approved pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine withdrawal creates treatment infrastructure
  gap'
- 'Step 2: Treatment programs cannot offer medication-assisted treatment comparable to opioid use disorder
  care'
- 'Step 3: Patients experiencing withdrawal without pharmacological support face higher discontinuation
  rates'
- 'Step 4: Treatment discontinuation increases relapse risk and perpetuates stimulant use disorder'
- 'Step 5: Structural limitations in treatment options maintain population-level stimulant use disorder

description: This systematic review reveals a structural gap in treatment capacity for methamphetamine
  use disorder. With no approved pharmacotherapy for withdrawal, treatment systems lack the tools available
  for other substance use disorders. The finding that amineptine showed promise but is no longer approved
  exemplifies how regulatory and pharmaceutical industry decisions create lasting treatment infrastructure
  deficits for vulnerable populations.

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how pharmaceutical development priorities and regulatory
    decisions create structural inequities in healthcare access. The disparity between treatment options
    for opioid versus stimulant use disorders reflects differential research investment and pharmaceutical
    industry interest. The predominantly male (88%) study population also suggests potential gender bias
    in clinical research participation and evidence generation for stimulant use disorders. Addressing
    this gap requires structural changes in research funding priorities and regulatory pathways.
