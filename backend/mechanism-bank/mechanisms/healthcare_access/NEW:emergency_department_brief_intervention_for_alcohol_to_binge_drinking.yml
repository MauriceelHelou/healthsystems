category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systematic screening protocols in emergency rooms identify patients with at-risk drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention (BI) is delivered to identified at-risk drinkers during ER visit'
- 'Step 3: BI provides immediate counseling and motivational interviewing to increase awareness of alcohol-related
  harms'
- 'Step 4: Patients receive information and resources for behavior change at a teachable moment'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in alcohol consumption behaviors including binge drinking occurs, though effect diminishes
  over time'

description: This systematic review of 13 articles (RCTs, meta-analyses, and reviews) finds that brief
  interventions delivered in emergency rooms are effective at reducing alcohol consumption among at-risk
  drinkers, though with modest effect sizes and heterogeneity across studies. The effectiveness appears
  to diminish over time, and optimal implementation strategies remain undefined.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural healthcare intervention that embeds alcohol
    screening into routine ER care, making it a system-level rather than individual-level approach. The
    ER setting provides a unique opportunity to reach populations who may not otherwise access preventive
    services, including those with lower socioeconomic status or who lack primary care access. However,
    the modest effect sizes highlight that individual-level brief interventions alone cannot address the
    broader structural determinants of alcohol use disorder, such as alcohol outlet density, marketing
    exposure, economic stress, and housing instability. Equity implications include ensuring BI is implemented
    consistently across all ER settings serving diverse populations.
