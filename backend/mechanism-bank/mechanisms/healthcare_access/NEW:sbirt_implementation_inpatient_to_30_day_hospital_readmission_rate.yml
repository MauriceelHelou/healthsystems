direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inpatient SBIRT identifies alcohol use disorder and initiates treatment engagement during acute
  hospitalization'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention addresses ambivalence about alcohol use and enhances motivation for change'
- 'Step 3: Referral to treatment establishes connection to outpatient addiction services for sustained
  care'
- 'Step 4: Continued engagement with treatment services supports ongoing abstinence or reduced drinking'
- 'Step 5: Sustained reduction in alcohol consumption prevents progression of liver disease and need for
  rehospitalization'

description: Inpatient SBIRT conducted during hospitalization for alcohol-associated hepatitis was associated
  with an 83% reduction in odds of 90-day readmission (OR 0.166, 95% CI 0.052-0.534, p=0.003). This sustained
  effect suggests SBIRT may facilitate lasting behavior change or treatment engagement.

  description: SBIRT effect was significant for alcohol-associated hepatitis (AAH) but NOT for decompensated
    alcohol-related cirrhosis (DARLC), suggesting earlier disease stage or reversibility may moderate
    intervention effectiveness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The persistence of protective effects at 90 days demonstrates how healthcare system
    organization shapes long-term outcomes. Patients without SBIRT access face ongoing structural barriers
    to addiction treatment, perpetuating cycles of hospitalization. This represents a healthcare equity
    issue - receipt of evidence-based addiction care during hospitalization is determined by institutional
    protocols and provider practices rather than patient need.
