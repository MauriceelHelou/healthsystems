- 'Step 1: ACT provides intensive, coordinated mental health services through multidisciplinary
  teams that actively engage individuals experiencing homelessness with severe mental
  illness'
- 'Step 2: ACT teams deliver services directly in community settings, reducing barriers
  to care and maintaining consistent contact with clients who might otherwise disengage
  from traditional services'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive support addresses multiple needs simultaneously (psychiatric
  care, medication management, housing assistance, substance use support), stabilizing
  mental health symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Improved mental health stability and continuous case management support
  enables individuals to obtain and maintain housing placements'
- 'Step 5: Reduced days homeless as individuals achieve greater housing stability
  through sustained engagement with ACT services'

description: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) reduces days homeless among individuals
  experiencing homelessness with severe mental illness. This systematic review found
  that mental health interventions including ACT appeared to reduce the number of
  days homeless. ACT employs intensive, mobile, multidisciplinary teams that provide
  comprehensive psychiatric and social services directly in community settings, maintaining
  engagement with hard-to-reach populations. The intervention also demonstrated cost-effectiveness,
  with included studies consistently showing that ACT saved payers money while improving
  health outcomes compared to usual care.
