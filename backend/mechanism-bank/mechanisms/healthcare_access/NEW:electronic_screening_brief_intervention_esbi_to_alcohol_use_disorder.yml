mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: e-SBI provides accessible, scalable alcohol screening in trauma care settings'
- 'Step 2: Electronic delivery reduces barriers to intervention (staffing, time constraints, stigma)'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention delivers personalized feedback on alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Patients receive motivation and strategies for reducing problematic drinking'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in problematic alcohol consumption up to 6 months post-implementation'

description: Electronic screening and brief intervention (e-SBI) in trauma care settings significantly
  reduces problematic alcohol consumption in the short term (up to 6 months) among alcohol-related trauma
  patients, though uncertainties exist regarding effects on specific risk behaviors like binge drinking
  and alcohol-related consequences.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to alcohol intervention by making
    screening accessible through technology in healthcare settings. The e-SBI approach removes dependence
    on individual healthcare provider availability and training, potentially reducing disparities in access
    to alcohol intervention services. The scalability of electronic interventions could address healthcare
    workforce limitations that disproportionately affect underserved populations.
