- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems with limited mechanical ventilation capacity cannot provide respiratory
  support when needed'
- 'Step 2: Higher volume fluid resuscitation increases risk of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure'
- 'Step 3: Patients developing respiratory failure from fluid overload cannot receive life-saving ventilatory
  support'
- 'Step 4: Inability to manage respiratory complications leads to increased mortality'

description: Limited access to mechanical ventilation modifies the effect of fluid resuscitation strategies
  in sepsis. In settings where mechanical ventilation is restricted, higher fluid volumes significantly
  increase mortality (OR 1.45), while this effect is attenuated in settings with adequate ventilator access
  (OR 1.09).

  variation_notes: Effect of higher fluid volume on mortality was significantly increased in settings
    with self-reported limited access to mechanical ventilation (OR 1.45) compared to settings with adequate
    access (OR 1.09), p=0.02 for subgroup differences.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding demonstrates how healthcare infrastructure deficits create treatment-related
    harms. The structural issue is not individual patient or provider behavior, but system-level resource
    allocation that determines whether complications of treatment can be managed. This has profound implications
    for global health equity and the transferability of clinical guidelines across different resource
    settings.
