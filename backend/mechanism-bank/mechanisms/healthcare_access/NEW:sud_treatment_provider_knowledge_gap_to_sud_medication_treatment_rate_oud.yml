mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medical education provides insufficient training on AUD pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 2: Providers lack knowledge about available AUD medications'
- 'Step 3: Providers feel uncomfortable prescribing AUD medications'
- 'Step 4: Patients with AUD do not receive evidence-based pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 5: Low utilization of AUD medications perpetuates untreated alcohol use disorder'

description: Multiple structural factors including lack of provider knowledge and discomfort with prescribing
  AUD medications contribute to low utilization of pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder in the United
  States.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Provider knowledge and comfort likely varies by region, training institution, and healthcare
    system context in the United States
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism directly identifies healthcare system structural barriers - provider
    education deficits and prescribing discomfort - as root causes of inadequate AUD treatment. This is
    a systems-level failure, not individual patient blame. Addressing this requires changes to medical
    education and healthcare delivery systems.
