- 'Step 1: Disadvantaged adolescents face structural barriers (stigma, cost, geographic distance) to accessing
  alcohol prevention services'
- 'Step 2: eHealth platforms provide confidential, accessible alcohol prevention content that bypasses
  traditional service barriers'
- 'Step 3: Digital interventions deliver evidence-based alcohol education and harm reduction messaging'
- 'Step 4: Intervention completers demonstrate reduced binge drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up'

description: eHealth interventions targeting alcohol use among disadvantaged adolescents showed significant
  reductions in binge drinking at 1-month follow-up among intervention completers, demonstrating that
  digital platforms can effectively deliver alcohol prevention to populations facing barriers to traditional
  services

    have limited access to alcohol prevention services

  description: Effects demonstrated at 1-month follow-up; longer-term sustainability unclear
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism recognizes that binge drinking among disadvantaged youth is partially
    explained by structural barriers to prevention services, not merely individual choice. The review
    identifies stigma, access, and affordability as key structural barriers that create health inequity.
    eHealth represents a structural intervention that can bypass these barriers. Equity implications:
    digital interventions may help reduce alcohol-related health disparities by democratizing access to
    prevention.'
