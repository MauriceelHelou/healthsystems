description: Urgent and emergency care settings are under-utilized for health promotion activities beyond
  alcohol prevention. Structural changes including training, service delivery integration, and supportive
  policy are needed to expand preventive services to under-served populations through these healthcare
  access points.

  variation_notes: UEC settings under-utilized for health promotion except for alcohol prevention; broader
    implementation needed across urgent care centers, minor injury units, and walk-in centres

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers to implementing health promotion
    in UEC settings. The current under-utilization represents a missed opportunity to address health inequities,
    as UEC settings disproportionately serve populations with limited access to primary care and higher
    rates of lifestyle-related health risks. Policy and system-level changes, rather than individual clinician
    efforts, are needed to realize health equity potential.
