- 'Step 1: Low utilization of AUD pharmacotherapy leaves patients without evidence-based treatment'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol use continues without medical intervention'
- 'Step 3: Progressive damage to liver and other organ systems accumulates'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-associated liver disease develops and progresses'
- 'Step 5: Increased mortality from alcohol-related causes including liver failure'

description: Chronic alcohol use is identified as a major cause of liver damage and death, with inadequate
  treatment utilization contributing to preventable mortality.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Treatment access and utilization varies across US regions based on healthcare infrastructure
    and provider availability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces alcohol-related mortality to structural healthcare failures
    rather than individual choice. The paper explicitly notes that system-level factors (provider knowledge
    gaps, prescribing discomfort) drive low treatment utilization, making this a structural health equity
    issue.
