  node_name: Receipt of Evidence-Based Alcohol Intervention
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional brief alcohol interventions require face-to-face contact in primary care settings,
  creating access barriers'
- 'Step 2: Digital interventions remove geographic, temporal, and stigma-related barriers to receiving
  alcohol intervention'
- 'Step 3: Technology platforms (computer, mobile device, smartphone) enable direct interaction with intervention
  content'
- 'Step 4: Community-dwelling populations can access interventions regardless of healthcare system engagement'
- 'Step 5: Increased population-level receipt of evidence-based alcohol interventions'

description: Digital and face-to-face alcohol interventions produced broadly similar outcomes (MD 0.52
  g/week, 95% CI -24.59 to 25.63), suggesting digital delivery can achieve comparable effectiveness while
  overcoming structural barriers to access inherent in face-to-face delivery models.

  equity_implications: 'This finding has significant equity implications: if digital interventions are
    similarly effective to face-to-face interventions, they can extend evidence-based alcohol harm reduction
    to populations facing structural barriers to healthcare access including rural/remote populations,
    those without regular healthcare providers, and those facing stigma or discrimination in healthcare
    settings. The proven strategy of brief conversation-based intervention can now reach beyond primary
    care settings.'
