description: The study is premised on the well-documented gap between AUD prevalence and treatment receipt.
  Developing AUD treatment options within primary care settings is identified as imperative to increase
  treatment access. The limited impact of the implementation intervention underscores the challenge of
  closing this treatment gap even with targeted implementation strategies.

  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural treatment gap in AUD care. The finding
    that only a minority of individuals with AUD receive treatment reflects healthcare system failures
    rather than patient resistance to care. The study's focus on primary care integration acknowledges
    that specialty treatment models create access barriers, particularly for veterans in this VHA context.
    Structural solutions require redesigning care delivery systems, not just educating providers.
