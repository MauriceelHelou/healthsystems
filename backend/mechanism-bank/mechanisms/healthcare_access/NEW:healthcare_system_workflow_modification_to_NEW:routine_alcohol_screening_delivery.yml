description: Modifications to healthcare system workflows, including EHR customization and staff training,
  enable routine delivery of alcohol screening in primary care settings. These structural changes address
  barriers to implementing evidence-based screening practices.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes that healthcare delivery challenges are structural rather
    than individual provider failures. Implementation barriers exist at the system level (infrastructure,
    workflows, training) and require system-level solutions. This avoids blaming individual clinicians
    for not screening and instead addresses root causes of implementation gaps.
