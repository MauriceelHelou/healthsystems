mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: BCT addresses both substance use and relationship functioning simultaneously'
- 'Step 2: Reduced substance use leads to fewer health, legal, and social consequences'
- 'Step 3: Partner engagement helps identify and intervene on consequence-producing behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Improved relationship stability provides buffer against escalating consequences'
- 'Step 5: Sustained reduction in consequences observed at 12-month follow-up'

description: BCT significantly reduces substance use consequences compared to control conditions (g=-0.28
  post-treatment, g=-0.34 at 12-month follow-up). Consequences may include health problems, relationship
  difficulties, legal issues, and occupational impairment.

  effect_size:
    value: -0.28
    type: standardized_mean_difference
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Substance use consequences are not merely individual outcomes but reflect interactions
    with social, legal, and healthcare systems. BCT's effectiveness in reducing consequences suggests
    it helps couples navigate and buffer against these structural systems more effectively.
