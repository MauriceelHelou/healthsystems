description: Prehabilitation interventions improve functional capacity by an average of 31.8 meters on
  the six-minute walk test prior to surgery, representing clinically meaningful improvement in physical
  function.

  equity_implications: Access to prehabilitation programs requires healthcare system infrastructure, insurance
    coverage, and patient capacity to attend programs. Inequities in healthcare access may create differential
    opportunities for prehabilitation, potentially exacerbating existing health disparities in surgical
    outcomes.
