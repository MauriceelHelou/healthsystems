direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended treatment duration (>28 days) for super-refractory status epilepticus provides sustained
  seizure suppression'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged intensive care allows for continued physiological stabilization despite ongoing neurological
  crisis'
- 'Step 3: Very long-term treatment enables greater opportunity for underlying etiology resolution or
  adaptation'
- 'Step 4: Mortality stabilizes after extended treatment period, with increased rates of seizure cessation'

description: Very long-term treatment (>28 days) for super-refractory status epilepticus was associated
  with lower mortality and high odds of seizure cessation, but with increased risk of moderate to severe
  disability. In-hospital mortality was 24.1% overall. This represents a distinct treatment pattern where
  younger patients without typical negative prognostic factors receive extended care.

  description: Mean age of patients was 40.8 years; younger patients may be more likely to receive aggressive
    long-term treatment. Notably, established prognostic factors like age were NOT associated with in-hospital
    mortality in this population

  strength: weak
  description: Unknown or nonmalignant etiologies were associated with receiving longer-term treatment;
    established prognostic factors including etiology were NOT associated with in-hospital mortality
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system capacity and treatment decision-making
    patterns. Access to prolonged ICU care and specialized neurological services represents a structural
    healthcare factor. The finding that traditional prognostic factors (age, etiology) did not predict
    mortality in this population suggests the disease course may be more dependent on healthcare system
    factors and treatment intensity than individual patient characteristics. Equity implications relate
    to differential access to specialized neurological care and ICU resources across geographic regions
    and healthcare systems.
