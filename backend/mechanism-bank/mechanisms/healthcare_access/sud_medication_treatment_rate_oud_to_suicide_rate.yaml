direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OAT (methadone or buprenorphine) stabilizes opioid-dependent individuals
  by reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms through controlled agonist activity
  at opioid receptors'
- 'Step 2: Treatment stabilization enables regular healthcare engagement, providing
  opportunities for mental health screening, intervention, and ongoing support'
- 'Step 3: Reduced chaotic drug-seeking behavior and associated psychosocial stressors
  (financial strain, legal problems, relationship difficulties) decreases depression
  and hopelessness'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological stabilization from consistent opioid agonist dosing may
  reduce emotional dysregulation and impulsivity associated with untreated opioid
  dependence'
- 'Step 5: Lower suicide mortality during OAT periods compared to periods not receiving
  treatment'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 RCTs and 36 cohort studies
  found that opioid agonist treatment is associated with a 52% reduction in suicide
  mortality (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.37-0.61) among people with opioid dependence. The protective
  effect operates through stabilization of opioid-dependent individuals, enabling
  healthcare engagement and reducing psychosocial stressors that contribute to suicidal
  behavior. The association was consistent across patient sex, age, geographic location,
  HIV status, hepatitis C status, and injection drug use status.
