- 'Step 1: Telemedicine platforms enable remote delivery of mental health treatments including CBTI'
- 'Step 2: Remote delivery removes geographic, transportation, and scheduling barriers to accessing care'
- 'Step 3: Patients in underserved areas or with limited mobility gain access to specialist care'
- 'Step 4: Increased utilization of evidence-based treatments that were previously inaccessible'
- 'Step 5: Equivalent clinical outcomes achieved compared to in-person care, validating expanded access'

description: This meta-analysis provides evidence that telemedicine delivery of CBTI is equivalent to
  in-person delivery for treating insomnia, supporting policy and healthcare system expansion of telehealth
  mental health services to increase treatment access.

  variation_notes: The study explicitly addresses limited accessibility to in-person CBTI as rationale
    for eHealth alternatives, with implications for rural and underserved areas with mental health provider

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Mental health provider shortages disproportionately affect rural communities and
    low-income urban areas. Telemedicine represents a structural intervention that can address healthcare
    access disparities by removing geographic barriers. However, the benefits of telemedicine access depend
    on adequate broadband infrastructure and digital literacy, which themselves have socioeconomic and
    geographic disparities. Policy interventions must address both telehealth expansion and underlying
    digital divides to ensure equitable access.
