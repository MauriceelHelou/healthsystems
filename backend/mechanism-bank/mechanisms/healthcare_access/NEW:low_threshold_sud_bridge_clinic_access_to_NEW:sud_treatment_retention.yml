description: The bridge clinic cascade of care model achieved 84% treatment retention at follow-up, with
  patients progressing through connection to transfer clinic, completion of clinic visit, and ongoing
  retention in care, demonstrating that structured low-barrier treatment pathways improve long-term engagement.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment retention historically low in SUD care often reflects systemic failures
    rather than individual motivation. This study demonstrates that restructuring the care delivery system
    to reduce barriers and facilitate transitions can dramatically improve retention outcomes, shifting
    focus from individual compliance to system design.
