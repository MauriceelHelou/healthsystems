mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Metformin administered as insulin sensitizer for PCOS treatment'
- 'Step 2: Drug absorbed through gastrointestinal tract causing local irritation'
- 'Step 3: GI adverse effects (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort) develop'
- 'Step 4: Adverse events limit treatment adherence and tolerability'

description: 'Meta-analysis of 6 RCTs (355 patients) found strong evidence that women receiving metformin
  had 5.17 times higher risk of adverse events compared to those receiving myo-inositol (RR=5.17, 95%
  CI: 2.91-9.17, p<.001), primarily gastrointestinal in nature.'

  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare access and treatment tolerability. Adverse
    effects from first-line treatments can create barriers to care, particularly for women without resources
    to manage side effects or access alternative treatments. The availability of better-tolerated alternatives
    like myo-inositol may improve treatment adherence and outcomes, especially in resource-limited settings.
