description: Brief alcohol interventions (under 3 hours) have a large and robust evidence base in primary
  care settings but show limited evidence of effectiveness on drinking levels in criminal justice settings.
  However, some effects have been shown on alcohol-related harm and among young people in USA settings.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The differential effectiveness of brief interventions between primary care and
    criminal justice settings suggests structural barriers within carceral environments that impede treatment
    success. These may include lack of follow-up capacity, competing priorities within criminal justice
    systems, and the punitive rather than therapeutic orientation of these settings. The evidence gap
    itself reflects underinvestment in research and treatment within criminal justice populations.
