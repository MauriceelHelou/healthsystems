mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social media platforms (Facebook, Reddit) provide low-barrier access to reach underserved populations
  where they already spend time'
- 'Step 2: Digital recruitment overcomes geographic, transportation, and scheduling barriers that prevent
  traditional treatment engagement'
- 'Step 3: Cost-effective outreach ($0.47-$0.66 per click) enables broader reach with limited resources'
- 'Step 4: High acceptability of digital interventions (62.6% willing to participate) indicates potential
  for improved treatment engagement through non-traditional modalities'

description: Digital health interventions delivered via social media can overcome structural barriers
  to substance use treatment among justice-involved young adults. The study demonstrated feasibility of
  recruiting a diverse, national sample with 62.6% expressing willingness to participate in digital interventions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies digital health as a structural solution to address systemic
    barriers (transportation, scheduling conflicts with supervision requirements, stigma of in-person
    treatment) that prevent justice-involved young adults from engaging in traditional treatment. The
    diverse racial composition of participants suggests digital approaches may help reduce disparities
    in treatment access. The approach shifts responsibility from individuals to overcome barriers toward
    system-level solutions.
