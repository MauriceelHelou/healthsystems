mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of clinical champions and external facilitation trains local providers in AUD
  pharmacotherapy prescribing'
- 'Step 2: Primary care providers receive access to consultation and educational materials, reducing knowledge
  barriers'
- 'Step 3: Patient identification dashboards enable systematic case finding of patients with AUD diagnoses'
- 'Step 4: Veterans with AUD receive educational materials before scheduled visits, increasing engagement
  readiness'
- 'Step 5: Increased prescribing rates of AUD pharmacotherapy at facility level improve treatment access'

description: This implementation study addresses the structural barrier that only 7.8% of individuals
  with AUD receive treatment annually, with most identified in primary care but rarely receiving pharmacological
  treatment. By integrating AUD pharmacotherapy options into primary care settings through multi-level
  implementation strategies, the intervention aims to increase prescribing rates and treatment access.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare system-level barriers rather than individual
    patient factors. The low treatment rate for AUD reflects structural gaps in healthcare delivery including
    provider training deficits, lack of systematic case identification, and inadequate integration between
    primary care and specialty SUD services. The intervention targets these system-level factors through
    organizational change strategies rather than patient behavior modification.
