  description: Effects may be particularly meaningful in settings with limited access to specialized substance

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol use disorders in low-resource settings are often untreated due to structural
    barriers including lack of specialized treatment facilities and workforce. Task-shifting to lay counsellors
    addresses this structural gap. The approach recognizes that alcohol use often occurs in contexts of
    poverty, trauma, and limited social support - structural factors rather than individual moral failures.
