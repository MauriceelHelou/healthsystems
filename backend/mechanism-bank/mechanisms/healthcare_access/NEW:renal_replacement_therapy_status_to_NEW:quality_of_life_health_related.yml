mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults with established kidney failure require ongoing renal replacement therapy (dialysis
  or transplantation)'
- 'Step 2: RRT imposes significant treatment burden including time constraints, dietary restrictions,
  and medical appointments'
- 'Step 3: Physical symptoms and treatment side effects contribute to reduced physical functioning'
- 'Step 4: Chronic disease management during developmental transition to adulthood disrupts normal life
  trajectory'
- 'Step 5: Combined physical and psychosocial burden results in substantially lower quality of life compared
  to healthy peers'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how chronic disease burden during young adulthood creates
    structural barriers to achieving developmental milestones. Healthcare system design that fails to
    address the unique needs of young adults with chronic kidney disease perpetuates health inequities.
    Access to transplantation versus dialysis may vary by socioeconomic status and geography.
