mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital training provides education on alcohol''s health impact and emergency care''s role
  in prevention'
- 'Step 2: Training increases healthcare workers'' knowledge about screening protocols and brief intervention
  techniques'
- 'Step 3: Improved knowledge translates to greater self-efficacy and confidence in delivering SBIRT'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced confidence reduces perceived barriers to integrating alcohol screening into clinical
  practice'

description: Brief digital training on Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT)
  increases healthcare workers' perceived knowledge, confidence, and skills related to alcohol prevention
  in urgent and emergency care settings. All participants (100%) found the training useful and would recommend
  it to others.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses a structural barrier to alcohol prevention - lack of workforce
    training - rather than blaming individual patients or providers. The intervention targets healthcare
    system capacity to identify and address excessive alcohol consumption. However, effectiveness depends
    on broader healthcare system support for SBIRT implementation, including adequate staffing, time allocation,
    and referral pathways. Equity implications include potential to improve alcohol screening for populations
    who primarily access care through emergency departments.
