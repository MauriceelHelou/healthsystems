to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder

direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems utilize existing nursing workforce to deliver alcohol screening and brief
  intervention'
- 'Step 2: Nurses in primary care settings identify patients with harmful/hazardous alcohol use through
  standardized screening'
- 'Step 3: Brief motivational counseling is provided during routine healthcare encounters'
- 'Step 4: Accessible and trusted nurse-patient relationships enhance intervention acceptability'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in harmful drinking patterns prevents progression to alcohol use disorder'

description: Nurse-delivered brief interventions demonstrate significant efficacy in reducing harmful
  alcohol use in LMIC settings, leveraging existing primary care workforce to address alcohol-related
  harms where specialist resources are limited.

  description: Nurse-delivered interventions showed significantly better effect (g=-0.44) compared to
    interventions by others (g=-0.14)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare workforce composition affects intervention
    effectiveness. In LMIC where physician density is low, task-shifting to nurses represents a structural
    adaptation to resource constraints. The effectiveness of nurse-delivered interventions suggests that
    health systems can address alcohol-related harms without requiring specialist providers, addressing
    structural inequities in healthcare access. This has implications for health workforce policy and
    training investments.
