- 'Step 1: e-SBIRT programs deploy electronic screening tools to identify individuals with substance use
  disorders in multiple settings'
- 'Step 2: Automated referral to treatment component connects identified individuals to appropriate treatment
  resources'
- 'Step 3: Digital delivery may reduce stigma and increase willingness to accept referrals compared to
  face-to-face interventions'
- 'Step 4: Linkage to treatment services potentially increases treatment uptake among those with addictive
  disorders'

description: e-SBIRT programs are designed to improve treatment uptake for addictive disorders by providing
  automated screening and referral pathways. While the theoretical mechanism suggests e-SBIRT could increase
  treatment entry rates by reducing barriers and expanding reach, the systematic review found no clear
  evidence that e-SBIRT is advantageous over control conditions for treatment outcomes. The evidence base
  is characterized as poor quality.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The low treatment uptake for addictive disorders reflects structural barriers in
    the healthcare system including insufficient treatment capacity, geographic access limitations, insurance
    coverage gaps, and stigma. e-SBIRT attempts to address some of these structural barriers through technology-based
    delivery, potentially reaching populations underserved by traditional healthcare. However, the lack
    of demonstrated effectiveness may indicate that addressing individual-level screening without addressing
    broader structural barriers to treatment access is insufficient. Equity implications include potential
    for technology-based interventions to either reduce or exacerbate disparities depending on digital
    access and literacy across populations.
