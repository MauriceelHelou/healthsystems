  node_name: Evidence Base for TB Treatment in People with Alcohol Use
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: 27.5% of TB clinical trials explicitly exclude people with excessive alcohol
  use, despite alcohol use being a major TB risk factor'
- 'Step 2: Exclusion prevents collection of data on treatment efficacy, adverse events,
  and drug interactions in people with alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Clinicians lack evidence-based guidance for managing TB treatment in people
  with alcohol use, including knowledge of immune function interactions'
- 'Step 4: Treatment guidelines inadequately address needs of people with alcohol
  use, leading to suboptimal care'
- 'Step 5: People with alcohol use experience worse TB treatment outcomes due to lack
  of tailored, evidence-based approaches'
