direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dental practices lack accommodations for patients with hearing, speech, or cognitive communication
  needs'
- 'Step 2: Information about appointments, procedures, and aftercare is not provided in accessible formats'
- 'Step 3: Patients cannot effectively communicate symptoms, consent to treatment, or understand instructions'
- 'Step 4: Quality of care diminishes and patients may avoid seeking dental services'
- 'Step 5: Oral health outcomes worsen due to communication-related barriers to effective treatment'

description: Communication difficulties were identified as a significant barrier to dental service access
  for people with disabilities. This includes lack of sign language interpretation, accessible written
  materials, and provider skills in alternative communication methods.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Communication barriers reflect structural failures in healthcare system design
    rather than patient deficits. Responsibility lies with healthcare systems to provide interpreter services,
    train staff in augmentative communication, and develop accessible patient materials. This has equity
    implications as communication barriers compound existing marginalization.
