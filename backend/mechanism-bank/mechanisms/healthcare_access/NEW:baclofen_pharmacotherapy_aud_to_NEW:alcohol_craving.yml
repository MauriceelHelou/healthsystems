direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Baclofen administered at doses up to 50-60 mg/day activates GABA-B receptors in the central
  nervous system'
- 'Step 2: GABA-B activation reduces neuronal excitability in circuits associated with craving and compulsive
  alcohol seeking'
- 'Step 3: Modulation of stress-related pathways and anxiety circuits that trigger craving responses'
- 'Step 4: Decreased subjective experience of craving for alcohol'
- 'Step 5: Reduced craving supports sustained engagement with treatment and recovery'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Craving is a neurobiological phenomenon influenced by environmental triggers including
    stress, social context, and alcohol availability. Medication-assisted treatment that addresses craving
    represents a structural intervention that reduces reliance on individual willpower alone. Access to
    this treatment modality depends on healthcare infrastructure, prescriber knowledge, and insurance
    coverage - all structural factors that vary by geography and socioeconomic status.
