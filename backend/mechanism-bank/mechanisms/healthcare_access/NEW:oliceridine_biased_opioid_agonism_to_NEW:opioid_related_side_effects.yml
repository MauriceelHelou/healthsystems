direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oliceridine''s biased agonism reduces beta-arrestin recruitment compared to conventional opioids'
- 'Step 2: Reduced beta-arrestin signaling is hypothesized to decrease adverse effects such as respiratory
  depression, nausea, and constipation'
- 'Step 3: Lower side effect burden may improve postoperative recovery and reduce complications'

description: The protocol plans to evaluate whether oliceridine's mechanism as a biased opioid agonist
  results in fewer side effects compared to conventional opioids like morphine. Dichotomous outcomes will
  be presented as risk ratios.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Reduction in opioid side effects has structural implications for healthcare systems
    managing postoperative care. Populations with limited access to intensive monitoring (rural hospitals,
    under-resourced facilities) could particularly benefit from medications with improved safety profiles.
    However, cost and formulary access may create disparities in who receives newer, potentially safer
    medications.
