mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to surgical intervention for low-risk ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) enables complete
  removal of pre-invasive lesions'
- 'Step 2: Surgical excision eliminates or reduces residual abnormal ductal cells that could undergo malignant
  transformation'
- 'Step 3: Reduced cellular burden of pre-malignant tissue decreases probability of invasive ipsilateral
  breast tumor events (iIBTE)'
- 'Step 4: Lower invasive progression rates translate to improved breast cancer-specific survival'

description: This meta-analysis of 33 studies (n=47,696) found that surgical treatment for low-risk DCIS
  significantly reduces invasive ipsilateral breast tumor events. At 5 years, iIBTE rates were 3.5% with
  surgery vs 9.0% without surgery (P=0.003). At 10 years, rates were 6.4% vs 22.7% (P=0.008). This represents
  a healthcare access mechanism where availability of appropriate surgical intervention prevents disease
  progression.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare system capacity and access to surgical oncology
    services. Structural barriers including insurance coverage, geographic access to specialized cancer
    centers, and healthcare system capacity may create disparities in who receives timely surgical treatment
    for DCIS. The finding that surgery significantly improves outcomes has equity implications regarding
    overtreatment debates, as decisions about active surveillance must consider whether patients have
    equal access to monitoring and subsequent intervention if needed.
