mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telemedicine platforms enable remote monitoring and communication between
  patients with diabetes and healthcare providers'
- 'Step 2: Increased frequency of contact and real-time feedback facilitates more
  responsive medication adjustments and lifestyle coaching'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced patient engagement and self-efficacy support improved adherence
  to diabetes management protocols'
- 'Step 4: Regular monitoring and timely interventions lead to better glycemic control,
  though effects on HbA1c are inconsistent across studies'

description: Telemedicine interventions for patients with diabetes (particularly those
  with comorbid hypertension) show potential to improve glycemic control through enhanced
  monitoring, patient engagement, and self-management support. However, evidence from
  this meta-analysis of 4 clinical trials indicates inconsistent effects on HbA1c
  outcomes specifically, while other quality of care indicators including patient
  experience showed improvement.
