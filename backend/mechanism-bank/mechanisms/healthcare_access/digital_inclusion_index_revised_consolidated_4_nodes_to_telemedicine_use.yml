  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural digital divide affecting older adults. Lower
    digital inclusion among elderly populations reflects systemic underinvestment in digital infrastructure
    and training for aging populations, not individual deficits. Equity implications include disparate
    access based on socioeconomic status affecting chronic disease management.
