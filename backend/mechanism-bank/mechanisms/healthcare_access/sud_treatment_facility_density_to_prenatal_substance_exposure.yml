- 'Step 1: Limited number of buprenorphine treatment clinics exist in region (490 total in North Carolina)'
- 'Step 2: Of responding clinics, only 34% accepted pregnant patients during pandemic'
- 'Step 3: Geographic distribution creates treatment deserts for pregnant individuals with OUD'
- 'Step 4: Inability to access medication treatment results in continued opioid use during pregnancy'
- 'Step 5: Ongoing opioid use leads to prenatal substance exposure affecting fetal development'

description: Low density of SUD treatment facilities accepting pregnant patients (only 34% during pandemic)
  creates structural barriers to care that increase risk of prenatal substance exposure. Treatment service
  limitations (45% prescribe naltrexone, 57% offer detoxification) further restrict therapeutic options.

  variation_notes: Study sampled every sixth clinic in North Carolina from SAMHSA locator; geographic
    distribution of accepting clinics not detailed but likely creates rural-urban disparities

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how healthcare infrastructure decisions at the policy
    and institutional level determine access to evidence-based treatment for pregnant individuals with
    OUD. The structural exclusion of pregnant patients from OUD treatment represents a systemic failure
    that leads to preventable prenatal exposures and adverse birth outcomes. Policy interventions requiring
    treatment facilities to serve pregnant populations would address this structural barrier.
