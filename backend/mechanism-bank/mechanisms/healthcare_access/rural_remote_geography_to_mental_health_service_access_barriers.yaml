mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural and remote geographic locations are characterized by greater distances
  from centralized mental health services'
- 'Step 2: Distance creates physical barriers including travel time, transportation
  costs, and logistical challenges for youth seeking mental health care'
- 'Step 3: Limited availability of mental health professionals in rural/remote areas
  reduces service options'
- 'Step 4: These geographic barriers compound access challenges for youth mental health
  service utilization'
