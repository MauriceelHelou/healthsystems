category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinically integrated services coordinate OUD treatment with other healthcare needs'
- 'Step 2: Patient-centered care approaches address individual motivations and barriers'
- 'Step 3: Coordinated care improves medication induction and stabilization experiences'
- 'Step 4: Improved treatment experiences support maintenance treatment and dose adjustment'
- 'Step 5: Higher quality integrated services increase overall OUD medication treatment rates'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on healthcare system structure rather than individual patient
    characteristics. The review explicitly calls for structural changes in service delivery to improve
    outcomes, representing a structural competency approach to OUD treatment.
