description: Baclofen up to 50-60 mg/day did not significantly affect relapse rates in this meta-analysis,
  despite improving percent days abstinent and reducing craving. This suggests that relapse is a complex
  outcome influenced by multiple factors beyond medication effects.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 1344
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Relapse prevention in AUD involves multiple structural factors including social
    support networks, housing stability, employment, access to continued care, and reduction in environmental
    triggers. Medication alone may be insufficient to prevent relapse without addressing these broader
    structural determinants. Comprehensive AUD treatment should integrate pharmacotherapy with social
    services and environmental modifications.
