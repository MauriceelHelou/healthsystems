description: Patients reported that being in their own environments during telehealth OUD treatment visits
  facilitated comfort and openness, contrasting with provider concerns about rapport-building. This patient-provider
  perception gap represents an important finding for understanding telehealth effectiveness.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the physical context of healthcare delivery shapes
    patient experience. In-person OUD treatment may expose patients to stigma (being seen at treatment
    facilities) and power imbalances (clinical settings). Telehealth restructures the clinical encounter
    in ways that may benefit patients, though provider concerns about rapport could limit telehealth offerings.
    Understanding this perception gap is critical for equitable telehealth implementation.
