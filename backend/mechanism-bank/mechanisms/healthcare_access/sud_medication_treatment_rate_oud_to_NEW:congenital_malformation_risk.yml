mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to medication-assisted treatment for OUD during pregnancy provides stable pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 2: Buprenorphine-based treatments (with or without naloxone) maintain maternal stability without
  increased teratogenic risk'
- 'Step 3: No difference in major congenital malformation rates between combination and monotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Expanding treatment options does not compromise fetal safety regarding birth defects'
- 'Step 5: Both formulations demonstrate comparable safety profiles for structural birth outcomes'

description: No differences were observed in major congenital malformations between buprenorphine-naloxone
  and buprenorphine alone exposures, supporting equivalent safety of both treatment formulations.

  equity_implications: This null finding is critically important for structural policy. Historical guidelines
    restricting combination product in pregnancy were based on limited safety data, creating structural
    barriers to treatment. Evidence of comparable safety supports policy changes that increase treatment
    flexibility and access for pregnant individuals with OUD.
