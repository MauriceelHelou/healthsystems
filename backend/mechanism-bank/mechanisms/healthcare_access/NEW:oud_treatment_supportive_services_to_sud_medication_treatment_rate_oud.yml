mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Treatment facilities decide which supportive services to offer alongside medication treatment'
- 'Step 2: No clinics provide childcare or transportation services for pregnant patients'
- 'Step 3: Absence of childcare and transportation creates practical barriers to treatment attendance'
- 'Step 4: Pregnant individuals with existing children or transportation limitations cannot consistently
  access treatment'
- 'Step 5: Reduced treatment engagement and completion among pregnant patients with OUD'

description: Complete absence of childcare and transportation services at OUD treatment facilities creates
  structural barriers for pregnant patients. While 86% offer individual counseling, the lack of practical
  supportive services prevents many pregnant individuals from accessing and maintaining treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the design of healthcare services fails to account
    for the lived realities of pregnant individuals seeking OUD treatment. The absence of childcare and
    transportation represents a structural failure to address known barriers to care. This disproportionately
    affects low-income individuals who may lack alternative childcare or transportation options, creating
    inequitable treatment access based on socioeconomic status.
