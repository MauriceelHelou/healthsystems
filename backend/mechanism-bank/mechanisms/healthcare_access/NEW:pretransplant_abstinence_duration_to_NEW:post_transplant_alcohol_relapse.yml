mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Duration of pre-transplant sobriety has been traditionally viewed as a predictor of post-transplant
  outcomes'
- 'Step 2: The 6-month rule was implemented based on assumption that longer abstinence indicates lower
  relapse risk'
- 'Step 3: Recent evidence challenges this assumption by showing abstinence duration is not predictive
  of relapse'
- 'Step 4: Other patient selection criteria may be more relevant for predicting post-transplant outcomes'

description: The meta-analysis provides evidence that the duration of pre-transplant sobriety is not associated
  with increased risk of alcohol relapse post-transplant. This challenges the long-standing clinical assumption
  underlying the 6-month abstinence requirement and suggests that alternative risk stratification approaches
  should be considered.

  description: Multifactorial patient selection criteria that assess psychosocial factors, social support,

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The abstinence duration requirement functions as a structural barrier within healthcare
    systems. It reflects historical moral judgments about alcohol use disorder rather than evidence-based
    patient selection. This policy may disproportionately affect patients with fewer resources for addiction
    treatment, housing stability, or social support during the waiting period. The finding that abstinence
    duration does not predict relapse suggests healthcare systems should adopt more equitable, evidence-based
    criteria for transplant eligibility.
