mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community-based resources and services may nominally exist in a community'
- 'Step 2: Multiple barriers make these services functionally inaccessible to LEAD participants'
- 'Step 3: Perceived inaccessibility prevents successful linkage despite diversion program efforts'
- 'Step 4: Participants cannot enter treatment despite being diverted from arrest'
- 'Step 5: Treatment entry rates remain low despite diversion program existence'

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights that service availability is insufficient without accessibility.
    Barriers to access often reflect structural inequities including transportation, cost, stigma, and
    systemic exclusion that disproportionately affect marginalized populations targeted by drug enforcement
