description: 'The review identifies three themes that could underpin development of an effective care
  model for people who use drugs/alcohol at end-of-life: interpersonal/organizational relationships, holistic
  care, and collaborating with other services and training. These structural factors in healthcare delivery
  improve access and quality of care.'

  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on healthcare system design as the key intervention point.
    The emphasis on organizational relationships, service collaboration, and staff training positions
    healthcare institutions as responsible for creating accessible, equitable care rather than expecting
    marginalized patients to navigate fragmented systems. This represents a structural approach to health
    equity.
