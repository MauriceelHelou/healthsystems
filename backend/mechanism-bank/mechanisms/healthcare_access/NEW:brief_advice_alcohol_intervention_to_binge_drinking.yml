description: Brief advice content was the most effective intervention component for reducing alcohol consumption
  quantity. However, the overall finding that intervention content did not significantly moderate effectiveness
  supports flexibility in implementation, allowing services to select tools suited to their context.

    structural implications: healthcare systems can implement locally-appropriate ABI tools without sacrificing
    effectiveness. This flexibility supports adaptation to diverse community contexts, resource constraints,
    and cultural considerations. The recommendation that ''services should select the ABI tool that best
    suits their needs'' acknowledges structural variation in healthcare delivery capacity.'
