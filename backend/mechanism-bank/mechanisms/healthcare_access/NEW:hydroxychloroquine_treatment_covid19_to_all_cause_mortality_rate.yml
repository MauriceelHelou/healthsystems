mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hydroxychloroquine administered to hospitalized COVID-19 patients at therapeutic or elevated
  doses'
- 'Step 2: Drug may cause cardiac toxicity including QT prolongation and arrhythmias'
- 'Step 3: Potential interference with beneficial immune responses or no therapeutic antiviral effect'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of adverse events without corresponding clinical benefit'
- 'Step 5: Net increase in all-cause mortality compared to standard care or placebo'

description: Meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials (10,012 patients) found hydroxychloroquine
  treatment for COVID-19 was associated with 11% increased odds of all-cause mortality (OR 1.11, 95% CI
  1.02-1.20). Results showed no heterogeneity (I²=0%) across trials, with findings dominated by large
  pragmatic trials RECOVERY and WHO SOLIDARITY.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding has structural implications for healthcare resource allocation and
    policy. The rapid adoption of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment without adequate evidence
    reflects structural pressures during pandemic emergencies to act before evidence accrues. Substantial
    research investment was allocated to these trials, representing opportunity costs. The finding that
    treatment caused harm underscores the importance of evidence-based medicine in crisis situations and
    the potential for unproven treatments to worsen health outcomes at population level, particularly
    affecting those with limited healthcare options who may be offered experimental treatments.
