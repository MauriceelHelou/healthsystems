  node_id: substance_use_treatment_dropout_rate

direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with AUD receive pharmacotherapy in addition to psychosocial intervention'
- 'Step 2: Medications reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms that often precipitate treatment dropout'
- 'Step 3: Improved symptom management increases treatment engagement and retention'
- 'Step 4: Lower relapse rates lead to reduced treatment dropout and leaving against medical advice'

description: High relapse rates with psychosocial intervention alone contribute to treatment dropout.
  Adding pharmacotherapy addresses biological aspects of alcohol dependence, improving treatment retention
  by reducing relapse precipitants.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment dropout in AUD is often attributed to patient motivation, but this mechanism
    reframes it as a treatment adequacy issue. When healthcare systems fail to provide comprehensive treatment
    including pharmacotherapy, higher dropout rates are predictable system failures rather than individual
    patient failures.
