description: The review identifies that studies on iCBT for AUD neglect crucial variables related to digital
  access including digital literacy, insurance coverage, and health equity. These structural barriers
  to digital health access may limit the potential of iCBT to address existing health disparities in AUD
  treatment.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Digital access varies significantly by geography, socioeconomic status, and community
    characteristics, creating potential for iCBT to exacerbate rather than reduce health disparities

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how digital health interventions designed to improve
    access may paradoxically reinforce inequities if structural barriers to digital access are not addressed.
    The review's critique that current trials lack diverse recruitment and language adaptation demonstrates
    how research design itself can perpetuate health inequities. Structural factors like broadband infrastructure,
    digital literacy programs, and insurance policy shape who can benefit from technological innovations
    in healthcare.
