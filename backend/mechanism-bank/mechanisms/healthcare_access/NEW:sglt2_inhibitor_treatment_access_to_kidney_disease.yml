mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems adopt SGLT2 inhibitors (Empagliflozin, Canagliflozin, Dapagliflozin) as
  standard treatment for CKD'
- 'Step 2: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce glucose reabsorption in proximal tubules, lowering intraglomerular
  pressure'
- 'Step 3: Reduced glomerular hyperfiltration slows progression of kidney damage'
- 'Step 4: Anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects provide additional renal protection'
- 'Step 5: Disease progression to end-stage renal disease is delayed or prevented'

description: SGLT2 inhibitors added to standard of care provide cost-effective treatment for CKD patients
  regardless of T2D status, with cost-saving benefits in CKD patients with T2D in high-income countries.
  This represents a healthcare system intervention that can reduce disease progression and economic burden.

    in high-income countries under health system perspective

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system-level determinants of CKD outcomes.
    Access to SGLT2 inhibitors depends on healthcare coverage, formulary inclusion, and affordability
    policies. The finding that cost-effectiveness varies by country income level suggests structural economic
    factors influence treatment access. Equity implications include that patients in lower-income settings
    may not have access to these beneficial treatments, and within-country disparities in insurance coverage
    could create differential access to these medications.
