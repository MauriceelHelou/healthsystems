mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Good adherence to CPAP therapy (≥4 hours/day) maintains upper airway patency during sleep'
- 'Step 2: Consistent airway patency prevents intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation characteristic
  of untreated obstructive sleep apnea'
- 'Step 3: Prevention of intermittent hypoxia reduces oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and sympathetic
  nervous system activation'
- 'Step 4: Reduced physiological stress decreases endothelial dysfunction and blood pressure variability'
- 'Step 5: These improvements lower the risk of recurrent major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events
  (MACCEs)'

description: Among patients with obstructive sleep apnea and established cardiovascular disease, good
  adherence to CPAP therapy (≥4 hours/day) was associated with a 31% reduction in risk of recurrent major
  adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. This benefit was not observed in intention-to-treat analysis,
  highlighting that treatment adherence is a key factor in achieving cardiovascular benefits from CPAP.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights structural barriers to healthcare effectiveness. Mean
    CPAP adherence was only 3.1 hours/day across the population, below the 4-hour threshold for benefit.
    Structural factors affecting CPAP adherence include: access to sleep medicine specialists, cost of
    CPAP equipment and supplies, patient education and support resources, healthcare system follow-up
    protocols, and insurance coverage policies. The null effect in intention-to-treat analysis suggests
    that simply prescribing CPAP without addressing adherence barriers does not improve outcomes. Health
    equity implications include: CPAP access and adherence support may be less available in under-resourced
    communities, creating disparities in secondary cardiovascular prevention among OSA patients.'
