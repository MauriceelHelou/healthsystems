direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Knowledge of AUD pharmacotherapy is insufficient among primary care providers'
- 'Step 2: Limited knowledge leads to under-prescription of evidence-based anti-craving treatments'
- 'Step 3: Patients with AUD presenting to primary care do not receive pharmacological support for withdrawal
  and craving'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or undertreated AUD persists, contributing to continued alcohol use disorder prevalence'

description: The systematic review concludes that knowledge and prescription of pharmacotherapy for AUD,
  specifically anti-craving treatment, is insufficient in primary care. This knowledge gap represents
  a structural barrier to treatment access.

  description: Training in addiction medicine during medical education and continuing education affects
    provider knowledge and prescribing behavior
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The knowledge deficit among providers is a structural issue rooted in medical education
    systems that historically underemphasize addiction medicine training. This creates treatment disparities
    where AUD patients encounter providers unprepared to offer evidence-based pharmacotherapy, perpetuating
    the cycle of undertreatment affecting the most prevalent yet most undertreated mental disorder globally.
