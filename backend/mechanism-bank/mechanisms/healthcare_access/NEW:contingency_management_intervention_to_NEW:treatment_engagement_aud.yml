mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Voucher-based contingency management provides gradual, increasing incentives for completing
  treatment-related goals'
- 'Step 2: Incentive structure leverages operant conditioning principles to reinforce treatment attendance
  behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Symbolic value of vouchers strengthens therapeutic alliance between patients and healthcare
  providers'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced therapeutic alliance and perceived effectiveness increase motivation for continued
  engagement'
- 'Step 5: Improved treatment engagement leads to better continuity of care for comorbid AUD and ARLD'

description: Voucher-based contingency management promotes treatment engagement among patients with comorbid
  alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related liver disease through operant conditioning principles, symbolic
  value of incentives, and strengthening of therapeutic alliance with healthcare providers.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 30
moderators:
- name: liver_disease_severity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Over half of cohort (54.2%) presented decompensated liver disease, suggesting intervention
    may be particularly relevant for severe cases requiring intensive engagement
- name: alcohol_consumption_severity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Participants consumed average of 179 units of alcohol per week, indicating intervention
    targets high-severity population with substantial treatment needs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural gaps in the care continuum for ARLD patients.
    Rather than blaming patients for poor treatment adherence, it recognizes that healthcare system design
    and incentive structures can be modified to better support engagement. The intervention addresses
    the structural barrier of suboptimal patient engagement with alcohol services by creating positive
    reinforcement mechanisms within the healthcare system itself. Equity implications include potential
    to reduce disparities in treatment completion for populations who face multiple barriers to sustained
    healthcare engagement.
