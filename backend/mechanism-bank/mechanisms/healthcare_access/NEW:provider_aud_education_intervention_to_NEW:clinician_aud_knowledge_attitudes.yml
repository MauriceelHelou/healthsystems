mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Flipped-classroom educational intervention using Kern''s Framework provides interdisciplinary
  content on AUD in cirrhosis patients'
- 'Step 2: Pre-recorded videos followed by live sessions cover withdrawal management, screening/brief
  intervention, and pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 3: Interactive learning format improves clinician knowledge and changes attitudes toward AUD treatment'
- 'Step 4: Improved attitudes measured by SAAPPQ domains reduce stigma and increase therapeutic commitment'

description: An interdisciplinary educational intervention using Kern's Framework and flipped-classroom
  methodology significantly improved clinician knowledge and attitudes (measured by SAAPPQ) about managing
  AUD in patients with cirrhosis. Effect sizes were medium to large across most topic areas.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses a structural barrier to AUD treatment access - insufficient
    clinician training and comfort managing AUD in hepatology settings. By targeting provider education
    at the system level, the intervention works to reduce treatment gaps without placing blame on patients.
    The structural root cause is inadequate medical education infrastructure for AUD treatment integration.
