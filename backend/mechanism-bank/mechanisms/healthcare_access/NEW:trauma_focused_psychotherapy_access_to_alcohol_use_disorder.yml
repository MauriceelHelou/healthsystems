description: Trauma-focused psychotherapy targeting PTSD (alone or integrated with SUD treatment) was
  superior to treatment as usual for reducing alcohol use severity in patients with co-occurring PTSD
  and SUD. This effect was significantly stronger for veterans than for civilians, suggesting veteran-specific
  factors enhance treatment response for alcohol outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural healthcare access issues - availability and
    delivery of evidence-based trauma-focused treatments for co-occurring conditions. Veterans may have
    differential access through VA systems and may respond differently due to military-specific trauma
    experiences, combat exposure, and military culture. The finding supports matching patients to appropriate
    treatments rather than blaming individuals for treatment non-response. Equity implications include
    ensuring civilian populations have equivalent access to integrated trauma-focused treatments that
    veterans receive through VA healthcare systems.
