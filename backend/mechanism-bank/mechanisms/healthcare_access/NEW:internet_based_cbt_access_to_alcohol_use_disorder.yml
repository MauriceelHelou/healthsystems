- 'Step 1: Internet-based CBT (iCBT) provides digital delivery of evidence-based cognitive behavioral
  therapy for AUD'
- 'Step 2: Digital format overcomes traditional access barriers including workforce shortages and geographic
  limitations'
- 'Step 3: Centralized educational materials, therapist communication, and progress dashboards support
  treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Self-guided, therapist-guided, or blended approaches accommodate varying levels of need and
  resources'
- 'Step 5: Improved access to effective psychotherapy reduces AUD symptoms and supports abstinence'

description: Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy demonstrates non-inferior to superior abstinence
  outcomes compared to treatment as usual for alcohol use disorder. iCBT addresses workforce shortages
  and access barriers by delivering evidence-based treatment through digital platforms, though implementation
  challenges and equity considerations remain underexplored.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Paper explicitly notes that studies neglect variables like insurance coverage and health
    equity, and recommends adapting materials to different languages for wider population benefit
moderators:
- name: digital_literacy
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Paper identifies digital literacy as a crucial but often neglected variable that affects
    iCBT effectiveness and accessibility
- name: insurance_coverage
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Paper notes insurance coverage is a neglected variable that affects treatment access and
    economic feasibility
- name: language_and_cultural_background
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Paper recommends adapting iCBT materials to different languages and actively recruiting
    from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural healthcare access barriers including workforce
    shortages and geographic limitations. However, the review explicitly critiques that current studies
    neglect crucial structural variables including insurance coverage, digital literacy, and health equity.
    The recommendation to adapt materials for diverse linguistic and cultural populations highlights how
    current digital health interventions may perpetuate existing health disparities if equity considerations
    are not incorporated into study design and implementation.
