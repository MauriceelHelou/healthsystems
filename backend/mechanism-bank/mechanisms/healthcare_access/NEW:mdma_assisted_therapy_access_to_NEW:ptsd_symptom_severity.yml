description: MDMA-assisted therapy significantly reduces PTSD symptoms compared to control conditions,
  with a large effect size (SMD=-0.85). This finding is based on 11 randomized controlled trials within
  a larger systematic review of 30 RCTs examining psychedelic-assisted therapies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to MDMA-assisted therapy represents a structural healthcare access issue.
    Current regulatory barriers limit availability of this promising treatment. Populations with higher
    PTSD prevalence (veterans, trauma survivors, marginalized communities) may face additional barriers
    to accessing experimental treatments due to healthcare system inequities, insurance coverage limitations,
    and geographic distribution of research sites. Expanding access requires policy changes at federal
    and state levels regarding controlled substance scheduling and treatment coverage.
