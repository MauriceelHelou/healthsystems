mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients face technological challenges including lack of devices, internet access, or digital
  literacy'
- 'Step 2: Technological barriers prevent successful engagement with telehealth platforms'
- 'Step 3: Patients unable to overcome technological barriers cannot access telehealth OUD treatment'
- 'Step 4: This creates structural exclusion from telehealth-based medication treatment for opioid use
  disorder'

description: Technological challenges were identified as barriers to telehealth OUD treatment across multiple
  studies in the review. These structural barriers to digital access prevent some patients from benefiting
  from otherwise accessible telehealth treatment.

    areas often having less broadband access

  description: Lower socioeconomic status associated with less access to technology and digital literacy,
    amplifying barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'Digital divide creates structural inequity in access to telehealth OUD treatment.
    Those with fewer economic resources face compounded barriers: both the original geographic/transportation
    barriers to in-person care AND technological barriers to telehealth care. This mechanism illustrates
    how new healthcare delivery innovations can perpetuate existing inequities if structural access issues
    are not addressed.'
