mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital therapeutic platforms deliver lifestyle interventions that promote weight loss in patients
  with liver disease'
- 'Step 2: Weight reduction decreases hepatic steatosis (fat accumulation in liver)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced hepatic fat burden decreases hepatocellular injury and inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Decreased liver injury manifests as improved (lower) liver enzyme levels indicating better
  liver health'

description: Digital therapeutic lifestyle interventions that produce weight loss also result in improvement
  in liver enzymes, indicating reduced hepatic injury in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated
  steatotic liver disease

  description: Higher baseline weight may provide greater opportunity for weight loss and consequent liver
    enzyme improvement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare delivery structure affects not just
    proximate outcomes (weight) but downstream organ-specific health. The liver enzyme improvement reflects
    reduced disease progression, potentially preventing costly and debilitating complications like cirrhosis.
    Scalable digital interventions could reduce the population burden of liver disease, which disproportionately
    affects communities with limited access to hepatology specialists and comprehensive lifestyle programs.
