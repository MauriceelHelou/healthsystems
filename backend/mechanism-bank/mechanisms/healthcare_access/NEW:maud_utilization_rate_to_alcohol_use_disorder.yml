direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FDA-approved medications (naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate) are effective treatments for
  AUD'
- 'Step 2: When patients access and adhere to MAUD, medication mechanisms reduce craving and/or create
  aversion to alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Reduced craving and drinking behavior leads to improved AUD outcomes'
- 'Step 4: However, current MAUD utilization rates remain particularly low compared to psychotherapy'
- 'Step 5: Low utilization represents a missed opportunity for reducing AUD burden at the population level'

description: Medications for alcohol use disorder are effective but dramatically underutilized. Increasing
  MAUD utilization through addressing patient-perceived barriers could significantly reduce AUD prevalence
  and related harms at the population level.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Low MAUD utilization reflects structural barriers including healthcare system failures
    to educate patients and providers, stigma embedded in policies and practices, insurance coverage limitations,
    and inadequate integration of MAUD into routine clinical care. These barriers are not uniformly distributed
    - marginalized populations likely face additional obstacles to accessing effective AUD treatment.
    Addressing low utilization requires system-level interventions rather than individual-level behavior
    change approaches.
