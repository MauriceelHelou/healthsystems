mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions deliver personalized feedback and behavior change techniques via accessible
  technology platforms'
- 'Step 2: Interventions employ median of 9 behavior change techniques including goal setting, problem
  solving, and information about antecedents'
- 'Step 3: Users can access interventions without scheduling appointments or facing healthcare system
  barriers'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement with digital content supports ongoing behavior modification'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in overall weekly alcohol consumption through cumulative effect of multiple behavior
  change techniques'

description: Digital alcohol interventions reduce weekly alcohol consumption by approximately 23 grams
  (about 3 UK standard drinks) compared to no or minimal intervention controls. This represents a clinically
  meaningful reduction achieved through accessible, technology-based delivery of behavior change techniques.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how technology can address structural healthcare access
    inequities by providing evidence-based interventions that bypass traditional barriers including geography,
    time constraints, stigma, and lack of trained providers. The finding that digital interventions are
    similarly effective to face-to-face interventions suggests potential for scaling alcohol harm reduction
    to underserved populations.
