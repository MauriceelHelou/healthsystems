description: Legal referrals to specialty SUD treatment were most often associated with alcohol use, though
  referrals for alcohol declined from 2015-2019. This suggests the legal system has historically been
  a significant pathway to alcohol treatment.

  description: Referrals for alcohol use declined from 2015-2019, potentially reducing this pathway's
    contribution to treatment access
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol-related legal referrals likely reflect enforcement patterns around DUI
    and public intoxication. The decline may indicate shifting enforcement priorities or policy changes.
    This mechanism highlights how criminal justice serves as a de facto gateway to treatment for alcohol
    use disorder, raising equity concerns about who receives treatment through this pathway versus voluntary
    access.
