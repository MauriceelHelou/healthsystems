mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential hospital quality and resource allocation across communities'
- 'Step 2: Minority children may be more likely to receive care at lower-resourced trauma facilities'
- 'Step 3: Implicit bias and discrimination may affect clinical decision-making and treatment intensity'
- 'Step 4: Disparities in quality of trauma care received lead to differential outcomes'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly traces disparities to structural racism in healthcare
    systems rather than individual patient factors. The focus on quality of care received emphasizes system-level
    factors creating differential treatment.
