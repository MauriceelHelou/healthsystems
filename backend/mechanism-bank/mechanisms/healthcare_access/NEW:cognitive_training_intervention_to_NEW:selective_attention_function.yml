description: Cognitive training shows significant improvement in selective attention (Hedges' g = 0.37)
  among older adults with MCI. Selective attention is critical for daily tasks requiring focus amid distractions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Selective attention deficits contribute to falls and risky driving - outcomes that
    disproportionately affect older adults without access to preventive cognitive interventions. Structural
    barriers to accessing cognitive training programs include cost, transportation, and availability of
    trained providers.
