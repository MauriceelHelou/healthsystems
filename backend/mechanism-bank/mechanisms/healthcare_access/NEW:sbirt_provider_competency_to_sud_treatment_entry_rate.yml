mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Providers with SBIRT training have increased confidence to screen patients for alcohol and
  substance use'
- 'Step 2: Systematic screening in primary care and mental health settings identifies patients with substance
  use disorders earlier'
- 'Step 3: Brief interventions delivered by trained providers increase patient awareness and motivation
  for change'
- 'Step 4: Appropriate referrals to treatment facilitated by providers with knowledge of referral pathways'
- 'Step 5: Increased treatment entry rates among identified patients'

description: Enhanced provider competency in SBIRT enables systematic screening and brief intervention
  in routine healthcare encounters, addressing the structural gap where many individuals with alcohol
  use disorders go unidentified in healthcare settings. This upstream intervention in workforce training
  can increase downstream treatment entry rates.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to SUD treatment access. Many patients
    with alcohol use disorders interact with healthcare systems but are never screened or referred to
    treatment. Training the healthcare workforce systematically in SBIRT transforms routine healthcare
    encounters into opportunities for intervention, reducing reliance on patients seeking help independently.
    This approach can reduce disparities in treatment access that arise when identification depends on
    patient self-referral or specialist-only detection.
