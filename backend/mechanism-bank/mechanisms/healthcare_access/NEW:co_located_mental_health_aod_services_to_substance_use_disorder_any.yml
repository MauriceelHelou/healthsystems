- 'Step 1: Physical co-location of mental health care and AOD specialist treatment eliminates structural
  barriers to accessing both services simultaneously'
- 'Step 2: Integrated care coordination addresses the interconnected nature of dual diagnosis conditions'
- 'Step 3: Reduced fragmentation decreases patient burden of navigating multiple separate systems'
- 'Step 4: Holistic treatment approach addresses underlying mental health conditions that drive substance
  use'
- 'Step 5: Improved treatment engagement leads to reductions in substance use and related harms'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural fragmentation in healthcare delivery that disproportionately
    affects individuals with complex, co-occurring conditions. Service fragmentation represents a systems-level
    barrier rather than individual-level deficit. Populations with dual diagnosis often face socioeconomic
    disadvantages and multiple barriers to care access.
