- 'Step 1: Traditional face-to-face CBT requires physical presence at treatment facilities'
- 'Step 2: In-person therapeutic alliance may enhance treatment engagement for some patients'
- 'Step 3: Direct clinician observation allows real-time adjustment of treatment approach'
- 'Step 4: CBT cognitive restructuring and behavioral strategies address drinking triggers and patterns'
- 'Step 5: Successful treatment completion reduces AUD severity and maintains recovery'

description: Face-to-face CBT is the traditional evidence-based delivery modality for AUD treatment. This
  review compared its effectiveness to digital alternatives, acknowledging that access barriers limit
  who can receive face-to-face treatment.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Face-to-face CBT availability varies significantly by region, with urban areas having
    greater provider density than rural areas

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Face-to-face treatment access is determined by structural factors including provider
    workforce distribution, insurance coverage, transportation infrastructure, and work flexibility. The
    study acknowledges 'access barriers' as a driver of digital CBT development, implicitly recognizing
    that geographic and economic factors create inequitable access to evidence-based AUD treatment. Communities
    with fewer treatment providers, limited public transit, and higher proportions of workers without
    flexible schedules face structural disadvantages in accessing care.
