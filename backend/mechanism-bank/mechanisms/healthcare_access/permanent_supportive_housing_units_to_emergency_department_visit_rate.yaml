- 'Step 1: Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) with Housing First approach provides
  immediate stable housing to homeless individuals with disabilities without requiring
  treatment compliance or sobriety first'
- 'Step 2: Stable housing reduces exposure to environmental hazards, violence, and
  stress associated with homelessness, decreasing acute health crises'
- 'Step 3: PSH programs include integrated supportive services (health, mental health,
  case management) that enable proactive outpatient care management'
- 'Step 4: Access to regular primary care and mental health services addresses health
  needs before they escalate to emergencies'
- 'Step 5: Improved housing stability and service coordination reduces reliance on
  emergency departments as primary source of healthcare'
