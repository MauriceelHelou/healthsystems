direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine provides
  stable, controlled doses of long-acting opioids that satisfy opioid receptors and
  reduce cravings'
- 'Step 2: Reduced cravings and withdrawal symptoms decrease illicit opioid use, thereby
  lowering risk of fatal overdose from unpredictable potency and contamination of
  street drugs'
- 'Step 3: Regular engagement with OAT programs connects patients to healthcare services,
  enabling monitoring and treatment of comorbid conditions (HIV, hepatitis C, cardiovascular
  disease)'
- 'Step 4: Stabilization on OAT reduces high-risk behaviors associated with drug-seeking,
  including injection drug use and related infections, decreasing infection-related
  mortality'
- 'Step 5: OAT reduces suicide risk through stabilization of mood, reduced desperation
  associated with addiction, and connection to mental health services'
- 'Step 6: Retention in treatment provides sustained protection; mortality risk increases
  substantially (6-fold) in the 4 weeks after OAT cessation due to loss of tolerance'

description: Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine reduces
  all-cause mortality by more than 50% among people with opioid dependence. This robust
  finding from two large meta-analyses (51 cohorts and 15 RCTs in Santo 2021; 30 cohorts
  in Ma 2019) demonstrates that OAT reduces not only overdose deaths but also suicide,
  cancer, alcohol-related, and cardiovascular mortality. The protective effect is
  consistent across sex, age, HIV status, hepatitis C status, and injection drug use
  status. Critical time periods of vulnerability include treatment initiation (first
  4 weeks of methadone) and treatment discontinuation, highlighting the importance
  of careful induction protocols and continuous treatment engagement.
