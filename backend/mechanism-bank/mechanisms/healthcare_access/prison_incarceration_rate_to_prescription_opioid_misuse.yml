mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incarcerated individuals with opioid use disorder receive prescribed opioid agonist treatment
  (e.g., sublingual buprenorphine) for maintenance therapy'
- 'Step 2: Prison environments with reduced access to illicit drugs create scarcity, increasing demand
  for available substances'
- 'Step 3: Prisoners divert prescribed sublingual buprenorphine by retaining tablets and administering
  them nasally'
- 'Step 4: Nasal administration emerges as dominant abuse route due to reduced injection drug use infrastructure
  in prisons'
- 'Step 5: Culture of prescription opioid diversion becomes normalized within prison populations'

description: Incarceration creates conditions where prescribed opioid medications, particularly sublingual
  buprenorphine, are diverted and abused. The prison environment's reduced access to illicit drugs and
  injection equipment leads to alternative abuse routes (nasal administration) becoming culturally normalized.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Significant differences in abuse behaviours between different countries were reported,
    suggesting national prison policies and drug availability patterns shape diversion practices

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how carceral institutions create unique drug use environments.
    The scarcity of illicit substances combined with continued addiction needs among incarcerated populations
    drives prescription medication diversion. Rather than framing this as individual moral failing, the
    structural factors of incarceration, limited treatment options, and medication formulation choices
    by healthcare systems shape these behaviors. Healthcare providers in prisons must consider 'least
    abusable' preparations as a structural intervention.
