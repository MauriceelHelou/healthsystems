mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: There is a lack of data and studies on the efficacy of anti-craving treatment specifically
  in primary care settings'
- 'Step 2: Without primary care-specific evidence, providers lack confidence in treatment effectiveness
  in their context'
- 'Step 3: Uncertainty about efficacy in primary care settings reduces willingness to prescribe'
- 'Step 4: Lower prescription rates for AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care persist'

description: The review explicitly notes a lack of data and studies on the efficacy of anti-craving treatment
  in primary care settings, despite primary care being where most AUD patients present. This research
  gap perpetuates treatment uncertainty and underuse.

  description: Research funding priorities that favor specialty over primary care settings perpetuate
    the evidence gap
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how research infrastructure and funding priorities create
    structural barriers to equitable care. When evidence is generated primarily in specialty settings
    inaccessible to many patients, it cannot inform practice in the settings where care is most needed,
    perpetuating treatment gaps that disproportionately affect underserved populations.
