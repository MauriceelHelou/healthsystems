description: The study background notes that treatment improves outcomes including reducing crime, yet
  few individuals with addiction receive treatment. The MARI program addresses this treatment gap by using
  police encounters as an opportunity to connect individuals to care rather than prosecution.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the structural treatment gap - 'few individuals with
    addiction receive treatment' despite known effectiveness. Barriers to treatment access are structural
    (cost, availability, stigma, criminal record barriers, lack of insurance) rather than individual choice.
    The MARI program represents a structural intervention that overcomes access barriers at the point
    of police contact.
