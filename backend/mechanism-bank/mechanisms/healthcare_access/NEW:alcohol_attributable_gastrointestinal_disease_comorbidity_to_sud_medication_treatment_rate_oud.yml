direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes gastrointestinal pathology including liver disease, pancreatitis,
  and gastritis'
- 'Step 2: Hepatic impairment may affect drug metabolism and create legitimate clinical concerns'
- 'Step 3: Prescriber caution about hepatotoxicity of some AUD medications may extend to inappropriate
  avoidance'
- 'Step 4: Lack of clear clinical guidelines for AUD pharmacotherapy in patients with GI comorbidities
  creates treatment hesitancy'
- 'Step 5: Patients with alcohol-related GI disease are systematically undertreated despite potential
  benefit from medications'

description: Patients with AUD and gastrointestinal comorbidities have 43% lower odds of filling prescriptions
  for AUD pharmacotherapy, representing significant underutilization even accounting for contraindications.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This pattern reflects structural barriers in healthcare delivery where clinical
    uncertainty and risk aversion lead to therapeutic nihilism. Patients who have already experienced
    organ damage from alcohol - and thus have the most to gain from abstinence support - are least likely
    to receive pharmacological tools to achieve it. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle of harm that
    is rooted in healthcare system failures rather than patient characteristics.
