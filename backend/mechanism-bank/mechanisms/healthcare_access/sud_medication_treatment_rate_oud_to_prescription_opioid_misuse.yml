mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pharmacotherapies for OUD (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) are evidence-based treatments
  that reduce opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Treatment engagement reduces non-medical opioid use through medication effects on opioid receptors'
- 'Step 3: Study population was actively receiving MOUD, providing context for examining whether concurrent
  cannabis use affects treatment outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Cannabis use status does not appear to modify the relationship between MOUD receipt and opioid
  use outcomes'

description: The study context establishes that among individuals receiving medications for opioid use
  disorder (MOUD), cannabis use does not appear to negatively impact treatment outcomes related to non-medical
  opioid use. This supports the protective effect of MOUD regardless of cannabis use status.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that cannabis use does not undermine MOUD effectiveness has structural
    implications for treatment access. Policy restrictions requiring cannabis abstinence for MOUD enrollment
    create unnecessary barriers to care. Given that MOUD is a critical intervention for reducing opioid
    overdose deaths, structural barriers that limit access disproportionately harm communities with high
    overdose burden, often those facing intersecting inequities related to race, poverty, and healthcare
    access.
