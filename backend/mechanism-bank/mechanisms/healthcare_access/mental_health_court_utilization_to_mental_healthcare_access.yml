description: Mental Health Courts function as a gateway to community-based mental health treatment for
  individuals who may otherwise face barriers to care. By mandating treatment participation as an alternative
  to incarceration, MHCs effectively increase mental healthcare access for a vulnerable population at
  the intersection of mental illness and criminal justice involvement.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural interventions can overcome barriers to
    mental healthcare access that disproportionately affect marginalized populations. Individuals involved
    in the criminal justice system often face multiple barriers to mental health treatment including poverty,
    lack of insurance, homelessness, and stigma. MHCs create a structural pathway to treatment that bypasses
    these individual-level barriers. However, equity concerns remain regarding who gets diverted to MHCs
    versus incarcerated, as racial and socioeconomic disparities in discretionary diversion decisions
    may limit access for some populations.
