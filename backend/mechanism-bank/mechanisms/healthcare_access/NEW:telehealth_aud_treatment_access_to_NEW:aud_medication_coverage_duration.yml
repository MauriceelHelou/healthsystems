mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telehealth enables more frequent provider contact for medication management'
- 'Step 2: Reduced barriers to follow-up visits improve medication monitoring and adjustment'
- 'Step 3: Sustained provider engagement supports continued medication prescribing'
- 'Step 4: Longer medication coverage duration achieved through reduced structural barriers to care'

  to only in-person care, indicating telehealth supports treatment continuity for pharmacotherapy

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare delivery modality acts as a structural
    determinant of treatment duration. The association between telehealth and longer medication coverage
    suggests that in-person-only requirements create barriers that limit treatment duration. Medication
    treatment for AUD is evidence-based but underutilized; telehealth may address access barriers at the
    systems level.
