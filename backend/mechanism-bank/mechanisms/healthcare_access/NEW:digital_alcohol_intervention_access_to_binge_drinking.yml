direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions provide accessible, personalized feedback on alcohol consumption patterns
  via computer, mobile device, or smartphone'
- 'Step 2: Behavior change techniques (problem solving, behavior substitution, goal setting) are delivered
  through digital platforms without requiring face-to-face clinical encounters'
- 'Step 3: Increased accessibility removes structural barriers to brief alcohol interventions (time, location,
  stigma, healthcare access)'
- 'Step 4: Users receive credible source information and can engage with interventions at their convenience'
- 'Step 5: Reduced frequency of binge drinking episodes through sustained engagement with intervention

description: Digital interventions reduce binge drinking episodes by approximately one session per month
  compared to no intervention controls, through delivery of accessible behavior change techniques that
  overcome traditional barriers to alcohol brief interventions

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to healthcare access by providing
    interventions that do not require clinical appointments, transportation, or overcoming stigma of seeking
    help. Digital delivery democratizes access to evidence-based alcohol interventions for community-dwelling
    populations who may lack access to primary care or specialist services.
