  node_id: NEW:lupus_nephritis_outcomes
  node_name: Lupus Nephritis Outcomes
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited access to rheumatology and nephrology specialists delays appropriate diagnosis and
  treatment'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare deserts and provider shortages reduce frequency of monitoring and early intervention'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate access leads to delayed recognition of disease flares and complications'
- 'Step 4: Progressive renal damage accumulates leading to end-stage renal disease'

description: Healthcare access as an SDoH domain affects lupus nephritis outcomes through specialist availability,
  care continuity, and timely intervention
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Healthcare access varies significantly by geographic location, with rural and underserved
    urban areas having less specialist availability
moderators:
- name: Specialist density
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Greater availability of rheumatologists and nephrologists may attenuate negative outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Healthcare access barriers reflect structural issues in healthcare system organization,
    geographic distribution of specialists, and insurance coverage policies. Addressing these requires
    health system redesign, telehealth expansion, and workforce distribution policies rather than expecting
    patients to overcome access barriers individually.
