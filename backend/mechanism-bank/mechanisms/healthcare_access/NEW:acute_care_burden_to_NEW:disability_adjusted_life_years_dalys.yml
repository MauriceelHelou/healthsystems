description: Acute conditions requiring short-term care interventions account for approximately 27% of
  global DALYs, representing the ongoing but minority contribution of acute care needs to global disease
  burden.

  description: Lower SDI regions may have higher acute care burden from infectious diseases and injuries
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While acute care burden is smaller than chronic, it remains significant and is
    inequitably distributed. Lower-income regions face higher burdens from infectious diseases and injuries,
    reflecting structural factors including sanitation infrastructure, occupational safety regulations,
    and access to emergency care. The acute-chronic distinction has important implications for health
    system resource allocation.
