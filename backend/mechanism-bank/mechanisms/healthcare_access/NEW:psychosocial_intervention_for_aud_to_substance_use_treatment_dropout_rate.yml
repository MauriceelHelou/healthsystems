description: 'Psychosocial interventions for AUD do not significantly affect treatment discontinuation
  rates compared to treatment-as-usual (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.80), suggesting comparable acceptability
  and tolerability'

  equity_implications: Similar treatment retention across intervention and control groups suggests that
    psychosocial interventions are not more burdensome than standard care. However, structural factors
    affecting treatment access and retention (transportation, work schedules, childcare, stigma) are not
    captured in these clinical trials. Addressing these structural barriers is essential for translating
    trial efficacy into real-world effectiveness, particularly for marginalized populations who face compounded
    access barriers.
