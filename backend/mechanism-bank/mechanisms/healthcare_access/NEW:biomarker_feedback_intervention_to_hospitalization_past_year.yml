mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Routine care integrates biomarker-based advice for high-risk drinkers'
- 'Step 2: Early intervention reduces progression of alcohol-related health conditions'
- 'Step 3: Prevention of complications such as liver failure, pancreatitis, and alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 4: Reduced need for inpatient hospitalization for alcohol-related conditions'
- 'Step 5: Fewer hospital days and reduced healthcare system burden'

description: Non-intervention groups experienced more days spent in hospital compared to those receiving
  biomarker-based intervention advice, indicating reduced hospitalization burden with early intervention.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 3763

  equity_implications: This mechanism connects healthcare system organization to downstream resource utilization.
    Structural factors determining whether patients receive this intervention include healthcare system
    funding for screening programs, provider training, and integration of biomarker testing into primary
    care workflows. Disparities in healthcare access create differential exposure to this protective intervention.
