mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smartphone-based interventions remove geographic barriers to alcohol treatment access'
- 'Step 2: Self-directed digital tools reduce stigma associated with seeking in-person addiction services'
- 'Step 3: Increased accessibility enables treatment engagement among populations traditionally underserved'
- 'Step 4: High feasibility (69% adherence) and acceptability (good functionality/aesthetics ratings)
  facilitate sustained engagement'
- 'Step 5: Accessible treatment platforms enable broader population-level reduction in hazardous drinking'

description: The study demonstrated that smartphone-delivered alcohol interventions are feasible and acceptable
  for middle-older adults, with 188 participants recruited (exceeding the ≥100 target), 69% achieving
  training adherence (4+ sessions), and acceptable uMARS scores for functionality, aesthetics, and quality.
  This suggests digital health platforms can successfully reach older adult populations with alcohol use
  concerns who may face barriers to traditional treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how digital health infrastructure can address structural
    barriers to substance use treatment, particularly for aging populations who may face transportation
    limitations, mobility challenges, or live in areas with limited specialized treatment services. The
    high feasibility and acceptability metrics suggest potential for scaling interventions to address
    population-level alcohol-related harm. However, digital interventions may exacerbate inequities for
    those without smartphone access, adequate internet connectivity, or digital literacy skills—factors
    that correlate with socioeconomic status and may disproportionately affect certain demographic groups
    among older adults.
