mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AA meetings are freely accessible with no professional fees or insurance requirements'
- 'Step 2: Effective recovery through AA reduces need for costly professional treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Sustained abstinence decreases alcohol-related medical complications and emergency services'
- 'Step 4: Reduced healthcare utilization generates substantial cost savings to healthcare system'

description: Three of four cost-effectiveness studies found AA/TSF had higher healthcare cost savings
  than outpatient treatment, CBT, and no AA/TSF treatment. AA/TSF probably produces substantial healthcare
  cost savings among people with alcohol use disorder, with moderate-certainty evidence.

  description: Participants with worse prognostic characteristics showed higher potential cost savings
    from AA/TSF compared to MET and other treatments
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The cost-free nature of AA addresses fundamental health equity concerns by providing
    effective treatment regardless of insurance status or ability to pay. This structural feature reduces
    socioeconomic barriers to recovery and may be particularly beneficial for low-income populations who
    face financial barriers to professional treatment. The healthcare system savings can potentially be
    redirected to other public health needs.
