description: FDA approval of chenodiol (Ctexli) as first targeted treatment for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
  provides standardized therapy that reduces plasma cholestanol and urinary bile alcohol levels by compensating
  for deficient bile acid synthesis, with greatest benefit when treatment begins before irreversible neurological
  damage occurs.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural healthcare access issues for rare disease
    populations. CTX was previously a 'neglected condition' lacking approved treatments. The FDA approval
    represents a policy-level intervention that creates treatment pathways. However, equity concerns remain
    regarding global access disparities, screening infrastructure availability, and whether all populations
    have equal access to early diagnosis. Rare disease patients often face systemic barriers including
    specialist shortages, diagnostic delays, and insurance coverage limitations that may disproportionately
    affect marginalized communities.
