direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regions with higher proportions of young PWID (aged ≤25) reflect emerging or expanding drug
  epidemics'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare and harm reduction infrastructure may lag behind rapidly evolving epidemics'
- 'Step 3: Young PWID populations face inadequate coverage of interventions for HIV/HCV prevention'
- 'Step 4: Structural gaps in intervention coverage increase blood-borne virus transmission risk'

description: Regions with the highest prevalence of young PWID (aged ≤25 years) also had the lowest coverage
  of interventions to prevent spread of blood-borne viruses, creating structural vulnerability.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Eastern Europe had highest proportion of young PWID (43.4%) and low intervention coverage;
    Middle East/North Africa had lowest young PWID (6.9%)

  description: Eastern Europe shows strongest association between young PWID populations and intervention
    gaps

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system capacity and policy investment
    in harm reduction fail to keep pace with emerging epidemics, creating structural inequities in health
    protection. Young PWID are not individually responsible for intervention gaps; these reflect policy
    and resource allocation failures.
