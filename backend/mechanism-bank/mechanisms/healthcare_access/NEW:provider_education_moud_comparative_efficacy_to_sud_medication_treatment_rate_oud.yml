direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NPs/PAs perceive buprenorphine as more efficacious than methadone despite similar evidence
  base'
- 'Step 2: Knowledge gaps about comparative MOUD efficacy affect prescribing decisions'
- 'Step 3: Incomplete provider education on medication options may limit treatment matching'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced education on all MOUD options could improve appropriate treatment selection'
- 'Step 5: Better informed prescribing could increase overall treatment rates and outcomes'

description: NPs/PAs perceive buprenorphine as more efficacious than methadone, suggesting need for improved
  education about comparative medication effectiveness to support evidence-based treatment decisions
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 240
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Medical education curriculum content is a structural factor that shapes provider
    knowledge and practice. Gaps in MOUD education reflect systemic underinvestment in addiction medicine
    training. Curricular reform at institutional levels addresses this structural barrier to quality OUD
    care.
