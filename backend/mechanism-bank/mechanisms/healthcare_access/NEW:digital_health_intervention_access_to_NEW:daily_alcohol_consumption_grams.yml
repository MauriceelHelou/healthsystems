mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital platforms deliver evidence-based brief interventions and motivational content to reduce
  alcohol intake'
- 'Step 2: Self-monitoring features increase user awareness of daily consumption quantities'
- 'Step 3: Personalized feedback and goal-setting tools support gradual reduction in drinking amounts'
- 'Step 4: Overall daily alcohol quantity decreases through sustained engagement with digital tools'

description: 'Digital interventions reduce daily alcohol consumption by 4.12 grams per day (95% CI: 2.88-5.36)
  compared to no intervention or minimal intervention controls. This represents the most robust finding
  from 66 studies assessing alcohol quantity outcomes.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how technology can democratize access to alcohol reduction
    support at the population level. Digital interventions bypass traditional healthcare system bottlenecks
    and can reach individuals who might never present to formal treatment. The effect addresses structural
    barriers including provider shortages, geographic isolation, and stigma. Population-level deployment
    could reduce alcohol-attributable harms at scale.
