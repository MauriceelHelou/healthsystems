description: External facilitation is an evidence-based implementation intervention that increases access
  to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The average total cost of implementation per site was
  $18,847 (SD 6717), ranging from $11,320 to $31,592, translating to approximately $48 per patient with
  OUD. Implementation costs were driven mostly by labor involved in planning and implementation activities.

  variation_notes: Costs varied by site based on number of encounters, participant composition, and salary
    levels. VHA sites had higher costs than BLS estimates due to higher wages.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses system-level barriers to MOUD access rather than individual-level
    factors. The focus on external facilitation as an implementation strategy recognizes that healthcare
    system capacity and organizational readiness are structural determinants of treatment access. The
    cost analysis provides decision makers with information to overcome resource barriers to implementing
    evidence-based OUD treatment, addressing the structural gap between available treatments and actual
    patient access. The finding that costs are affordable depending on payer budget constraints highlights
    how healthcare financing structures influence treatment availability.
