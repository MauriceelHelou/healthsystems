mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) is inhaled nasally by emergency department patients experiencing nausea'
- 'Step 2: Volatile IPA molecules stimulate olfactory receptors and trigeminal nerve endings'
- 'Step 3: Neural signaling modulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting center in the brainstem'
- 'Step 4: This aromatherapy intervention reduces perceived nausea intensity on validated scales'

description: Inhaled isopropyl alcohol reduces nausea severity in adult emergency department patients
  by a mean of 2.18 points on a 0-10 scale compared to placebo, exceeding the minimum clinically significant
  difference of 1.5 points. This represents a low-cost, rapidly available intervention for acute nausea
  management.

  description: When IPA was combined with oral ondansetron, the differential effect compared to placebo
    with ondansetron was less clear, suggesting potential interaction or ceiling effect
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare access and resource availability in emergency
    settings. IPA inhalation represents an accessible, low-cost intervention that could reduce reliance
    on pharmaceutical antiemetics and decrease ED wait times for symptom relief. The intervention could
    have equity implications as a cost-effective alternative when medication access is limited. However,
    this is primarily a clinical treatment mechanism rather than a structural determinant of health. The
    evidence is graded moderate due to imprecision from limited patient numbers (n=195 across pooled studies).
