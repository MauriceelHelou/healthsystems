- 'Step 1: Co-located services provide accessible outpatient care for individuals with complex dual diagnoses'
- 'Step 2: Improved treatment engagement and continuity reduces crisis presentations'
- 'Step 3: Better management of both mental health and substance use conditions prevents acute exacerbations'
- 'Step 4: Decreased emergency department presentations and hospital admissions'

description: Integrated care including co-located mental health and AOD treatment is associated with decreased
  emergency department presentations and hospital admissions.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: High ED utilization among dual diagnosis populations reflects systemic failures
    in outpatient care access rather than patient choice. Structural barriers including fragmented services,
    transportation challenges, and limited capacity drive crisis-oriented care patterns.
