mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Health systems historically developed around infectious disease and acute injury models'
- 'Step 2: Infrastructure, workforce training, and financing mechanisms remain oriented toward episodic
  acute care'
- 'Step 3: Chronic conditions now dominate disease burden (68% DALYs, 86% YLD, 71% YLL)'
- 'Step 4: Structural mismatch between health system design and population health needs creates chronic
  care capacity gaps'

description: The study highlights that health systems are often unprepared for chronic care demands despite
  chronic conditions accounting for the majority of global disease burden. This structural mismatch between
  system design and population needs necessitates health system adaptation.

  description: Lower SDI regions have greater mismatch between chronic care needs and system capacity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a fundamental structural problem at the health system
    level. The mismatch is not due to individual patient behaviors but to historical policy decisions
    about health system design, financing, and workforce training. Addressing this requires policy-level
    transformation including reorienting health financing, primary care strengthening, and workforce development
    for chronic care management. Equity implications are significant as marginalized populations face
    both higher chronic disease burden and less access to adapted health systems.
