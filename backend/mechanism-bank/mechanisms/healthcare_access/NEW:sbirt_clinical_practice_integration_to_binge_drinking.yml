- 'Step 1: Systematic screening identifies patients with excessive alcohol consumption during emergency
  encounters'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions provide personalized feedback and motivational support for behavior change'
- 'Step 3: Referrals connect patients with specialized treatment for more severe alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 4: Early identification and intervention prevents escalation of harmful drinking patterns'
- 'Step 5: Population-level implementation contributes to reduced alcohol-related health burden'

description: Integration of SBIRT into routine emergency care creates systematic opportunities to identify
  excessive alcohol consumption and provide early intervention, potentially reducing population-level
  harmful drinking. The abstract notes this mechanism is theoretically expected but patient outcomes not
  yet tested.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural intervention targeting healthcare system
    capacity rather than individual behavior change alone. By building workforce capacity for SBIRT, the
    intervention creates conditions for systematic identification and support for people with excessive
    alcohol consumption. The approach avoids individual blame by recognizing that effective intervention
    requires trained healthcare infrastructure. Equity implications include potential benefits for populations
    who rely on emergency departments for care access, though structural barriers to treatment referral
    completion (insurance, transportation, availability) may limit effectiveness for marginalized populations.
