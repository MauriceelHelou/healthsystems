- 'Step 1: Three FDA-approved medications (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) provide
  proven effective pharmacological treatment for OUD'
- 'Step 2: MAT medications address neurobiological mechanisms of opioid dependence
  through agonist, partial agonist, or antagonist actions'

  and risk of overdose'
- 'Step 4: Increased availability and accessibility of MAT medications improves treatment
  outcomes and reduces opioid-related morbidity and mortality'
