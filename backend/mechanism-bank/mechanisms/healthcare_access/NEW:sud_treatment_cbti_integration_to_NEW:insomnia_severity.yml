mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems integrate CBT-I into AUD prevention and treatment settings'
- 'Step 2: Patients with AUD gain access to evidence-based insomnia treatment within existing care pathways'
- 'Step 3: Reduced barriers to accessing CBT-I for vulnerable populations with comorbid conditions'
- 'Step 4: Large reductions in insomnia severity achieved across AUD spectrum'
- 'Step 5: Sustained improvements maintained through follow-up periods'

description: The meta-analysis supports structural integration of CBT-I into AUD prevention and treatment
  settings based on consistent evidence of effectiveness across the AUD severity spectrum. This represents
  a policy-relevant finding for healthcare system design and resource allocation.

  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes the structural healthcare system changes needed to implement
    evidence-based practices. The recommendation for 'wide implementation in AUD prevention and treatment
    settings' acknowledges that individual-level access to effective treatments depends on system-level
    decisions about service integration, provider training, and resource allocation. Equity implications
    include ensuring that populations with AUD—who often face stigma, socioeconomic disadvantage, and
    fragmented care—have equal access to effective sleep interventions.
