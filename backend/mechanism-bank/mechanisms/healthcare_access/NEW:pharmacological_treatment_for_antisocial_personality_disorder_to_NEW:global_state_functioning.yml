mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Antidepressant (nortriptyline) or dopamine agonist (bromocriptine) administered to individuals
  with AsPD and comorbid alcohol dependency'
- 'Step 2: Medications may modulate neurotransmitter systems involved in mood and impulse regulation'
- 'Step 3: No significant difference observed in global state/functioning scores between treatment and
  placebo groups'

description: Very low certainty evidence from two small studies found no significant difference between
  nortriptyline (mean GSI=0.3 vs placebo=0.7) or bromocriptine (mean GSI=0.4 vs placebo=0.7) and placebo
  on global state/functioning measured by SCL-90 Global Severity Index at 6 months in individuals with
  AsPD and alcohol dependency.

  description: Participants had comorbid alcohol dependency which may affect treatment response and complicate
    interpretation of AsPD-specific effects
- name: adverse_effects
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Bromocriptine caused severe side effects in 12 patients with 5 dropping out within first
    two days due to nausea and flu-like symptoms
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The intersection of AsPD with alcohol use disorder highlights the need for integrated
    treatment approaches addressing both conditions. Structural barriers to treatment include lack of
    specialized services, stigma associated with personality disorders, and healthcare system fragmentation.
    The high attrition due to adverse effects in the bromocriptine study suggests need for better tolerated
    treatments, particularly for vulnerable populations who may have limited healthcare access and support
    systems.
