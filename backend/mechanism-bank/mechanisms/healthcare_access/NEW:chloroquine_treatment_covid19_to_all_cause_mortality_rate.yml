category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chloroquine administered to COVID-19 patients based on theoretical antiviral properties'
- 'Step 2: Drug has known cardiac toxicity profile similar to hydroxychloroquine'
- 'Step 3: No demonstrated therapeutic benefit against SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical trials'
- 'Step 4: Potential for adverse events without offsetting clinical improvement'
- 'Step 5: No mortality benefit observed, with wide confidence intervals due to limited data'

description: Meta-analysis of 4 randomized controlled trials (307 patients) found no mortality benefit
  from chloroquine treatment for COVID-19 (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.15-21.13). The extremely wide confidence
  intervals reflect the small evidence base and preclude definitive conclusions, though the point estimate
  suggests potential harm.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The limited evidence base for chloroquine reflects structural challenges in pandemic
    research coordination. Different countries pursued different antimalarial drugs based on local availability
    and regulatory environments. This fragmentation of research efforts across similar but not identical
    interventions reduced statistical power to detect effects. The finding highlights how global health
    infrastructure and research coordination systems affect the quality of evidence available for clinical
    decision-making.
