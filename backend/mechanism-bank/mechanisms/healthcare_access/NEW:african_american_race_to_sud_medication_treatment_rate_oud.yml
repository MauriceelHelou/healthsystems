- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential access to healthcare services and quality of care'
- 'Step 2: Implicit bias among providers may lead to lower rates of AUD screening and pharmacotherapy
  recommendations for African-American women'
- 'Step 3: Historical medical mistrust due to systemic racism may affect treatment engagement and acceptance'
- 'Step 4: Reduced likelihood of receiving evidence-based pharmacotherapy for AUD among African-American
  women veterans'

description: African-American women veterans have 27% lower odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD
  compared to non-African-American women veterans, demonstrating persistent racial disparities in evidence-based
  substance use treatment within the VHA system.

  equity_implications: This finding demonstrates that structural racism operates within the VHA healthcare
    system despite its universal coverage model. Racial disparities in pharmacotherapy receipt cannot
    be attributed to insurance or access barriers, pointing to implicit bias, differential treatment recommendations,
    or systemic factors that disadvantage African-American women in receiving evidence-based AUD treatment.
    This disparity requires targeted interventions addressing provider bias and systemic barriers to equitable
    care.
