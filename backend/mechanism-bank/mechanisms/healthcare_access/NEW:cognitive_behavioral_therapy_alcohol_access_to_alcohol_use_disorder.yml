structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to CBT requires trained mental health providers, which are often in shortage,
    particularly in rural and underserved areas. The workforce distribution of addiction specialists and
    the lack of integration between hepatology and behavioral health services represent structural barriers
    that may create disparities in treatment access.
