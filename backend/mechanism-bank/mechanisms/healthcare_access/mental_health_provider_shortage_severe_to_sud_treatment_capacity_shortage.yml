direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Shortages of behavioral health providers in the U.S. limit the number of clinical settings
  offering OUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Limited treatment capacity creates bottlenecks for patients seeking medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 3: Long wait times and geographic barriers result in untreated OUD and continued substance use'
- 'Step 4: Alternative access points (like pharmacist-provided services) become necessary to address the
  treatment gap'

  expansion of treatment access through alternative healthcare professionals such as community pharmacists.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies workforce distribution as a structural determinant of
    treatment access, recognizing that provider shortages are a systemic issue requiring policy solutions
    rather than individual-level interventions. Rural and underserved communities bear disproportionate
    burden of these shortages, creating health inequities in OUD treatment access.
