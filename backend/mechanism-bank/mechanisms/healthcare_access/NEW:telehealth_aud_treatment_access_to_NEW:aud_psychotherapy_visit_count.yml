direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telehealth modality removes geographic and transportation barriers to accessing AUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Reduced need for in-person travel decreases time and cost burden for patients'
- 'Step 3: Lower barriers enable patients to attend more frequent treatment sessions'
- 'Step 4: Increased psychotherapy visit frequency improves treatment engagement and continuity'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare access barriers as structural determinants.
    The shift to telehealth during COVID-19 represents a systems-level change that differentially benefits
    those facing transportation, geographic, or scheduling barriers. However, the findings reveal equity
    concerns as male patients and those with polysubstance use disorders face additional barriers to telehealth
    access, suggesting structural gaps in service delivery.
