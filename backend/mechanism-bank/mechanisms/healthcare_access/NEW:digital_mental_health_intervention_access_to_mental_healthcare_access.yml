direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital technologies (telehealth, mobile apps, virtual reality) are deployed to deliver mental
  health services'
- 'Step 2: Scalable, real-time interventions reduce geographic and temporal barriers to care'
- 'Step 3: Patients who previously lacked access due to distance, stigma, or scheduling constraints can
  receive services'
- 'Step 4: Overall population-level access to mental healthcare increases'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to mental healthcare including geographic
    maldistribution of providers, stigma, and healthcare system capacity constraints. Digital interventions
    can democratize access but risk exacerbating inequities for digitally excluded populations (elderly,
    low-income, rural without broadband). Policy must ensure digital mental health expansion addresses
    rather than widens structural inequities.
