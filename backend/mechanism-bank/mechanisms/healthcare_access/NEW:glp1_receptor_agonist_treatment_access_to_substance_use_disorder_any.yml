mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: GLP-1 receptor agonists administered systemically cross blood-brain barrier to access central
  receptors'
- 'Step 2: Brain GLP-1 receptor activation modulates mesolimbic reward circuitry'
- 'Step 3: Reduced reward salience and craving for substances of abuse'
- 'Step 4: Decreased pathological substance consumption across multiple substance classes'

  equity_implications: The identification of a common biological mechanism across substance use disorders
    challenges stigmatizing narratives that frame addiction as moral failing. Structural factors determining
    access to these treatments (insurance coverage, prescriber availability, drug costs) will shape who
    benefits from this therapeutic approach. Disparities in diabetes and obesity treatment access suggest
    similar inequities may emerge for SUD applications.
