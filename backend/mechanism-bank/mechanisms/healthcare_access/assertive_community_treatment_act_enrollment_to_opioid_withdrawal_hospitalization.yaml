mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ACT provides intensive, community-based outreach that proactively engages
  patients with substance use disorders who have difficulty accessing traditional
  outpatient care'
- 'Step 2: ACT integrates specific SUD treatments into comprehensive case management,
  addressing substantial medical and social needs in the community setting'
- 'Step 3: Increased treatment engagement and continuous care coordination prevents
  escalation of withdrawal symptoms and related medical crises'
- 'Step 4: Proactive management of substance use and associated health issues reduces
  need for acute inpatient hospitalization for withdrawal and related complications'

description: Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) reduces hospitalization rates among
  patients with substance use disorders through intensive community-based engagement,
  integrated SUD treatment, and proactive care coordination. A systematic review of
  5 randomized controlled datasets found positive effects on hospitalization rates
  in 2 datasets, with treatment engagement consistently higher for ACT groups. The
  effect is strongest among high service utilizers and when ACT model fidelity is
  maintained.
