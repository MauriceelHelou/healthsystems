direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited approved pharmacotherapies (only 3 widely-approved medications) restricts treatment
  options for heterogeneous AUD population'
- 'Step 2: Under-treatment of AUD persists due to lack of diverse medication options matching patient-specific
  needs'
- 'Step 3: Stigma and lack of pharmacological variety reduce treatment-seeking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or inadequately treated AUD leads to continued alcohol-related health harms'

description: Limited approved pharmacotherapies for AUD contribute to under-treatment. The review identifies
  22 medications (approved, repurposed, and novel) that could expand treatment options for the heterogeneous
  AUD population, potentially improving outcomes through precision medicine approaches.
moderators:
- name: AUD heterogeneity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Given AUD is a heterogeneous disorder, availability of diverse pharmacotherapies increases
    likelihood of finding effective individual treatment
- name: Treatment stigma
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Stigma associated with AUD treatment reduces treatment-seeking even when pharmacotherapies
    are available
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural healthcare barriers rather than individual
    blame. The limited availability of approved treatments is a systemic failure, not patient non-compliance.
    Expanding approved medications and reducing treatment stigma are structural interventions that could
    improve AUD outcomes across populations.
