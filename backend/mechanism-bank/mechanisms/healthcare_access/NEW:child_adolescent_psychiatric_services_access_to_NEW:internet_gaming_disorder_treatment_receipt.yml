category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children aged 13-18 presenting to child and adolescent psychiatry units are screened for gaming
  behavior'
- 'Step 2: Those meeting DSM-5 proposed criteria for IGD are identified and offered evidence-based treatment'
- 'Step 3: Treatment integration within existing psychiatric services facilitates access without additional
  referral barriers'
- 'Step 4: Structured treatment protocol (5-7 individual 45-minute sessions) is delivered within the clinical
  setting'

description: Access to child and adolescent psychiatric services that systematically screen for and treat
  internet gaming disorder enables identification and treatment of affected youth. The integration of
  IGD treatment within existing psychiatric infrastructure reduces barriers to specialized behavioral
  health care.

  description: Treatment limited to ages 13-18; younger adolescents may have been excluded due to age
    restrictions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare system design and service availability
    determine access to specialized behavioral health treatment. The Swedish universal healthcare model
    provides structural context for equitable access, though language requirements may create barriers
    for immigrant populations. The systematic screening approach at first psychiatric visits represents
    a structural intervention that can identify cases that might otherwise go untreated.
