- 'Step 1: Release from incarceration represents a high-risk transition period with disrupted healthcare
  continuity'
- 'Step 2: Carceral institutions prioritize behavioral health and acute medical needs over HIV prevention
  services like PrEP'
- 'Step 3: Disconnection between carceral institutions and community providers limits linkage to HIV prevention
  care post-release'
- 'Step 4: People releasing from incarceration have difficulty accessing PrEP and HIV prevention during
  this vulnerable period'
- 'Step 5: Increased HIV acquisition risk during the reentry period'

description: Release from prison or jail is identified as a high-risk time for HIV acquisition. Carceral
  institutions have PrEP available but do not offer it widely, instead focusing on behavioral health or
  acute medical needs. The disconnection between carceral institutions and community providers creates
  barriers to HIV prevention care linkage.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism traces HIV risk to structural failures in the carceral-to-community
    healthcare transition rather than individual behavior. The paper identifies five structural themes:
    primacy of basic needs deprioritizing HIV prevention, lack of funding for prevention programming,
    cultural/philosophical differences in institutions, disconnection between carceral and community providers,
    and tensions between confidentiality and care coordination. These are systemic barriers that disproportionately
    affect incarcerated populations who are already marginalized.'
