direction: positive
category: environmental
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy metals (As, Cr, Cd, Pb) contaminate drinking water supplies through industrial discharge,
  agricultural runoff, and natural geological sources'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure to arsenic through drinking water leads to bioaccumulation in human tissues'
- 'Step 3: Arsenic acts as a known carcinogen, inducing DNA damage, oxidative stress, and disruption of
  cellular signaling pathways'
- 'Step 4: Long-term exposure increases probability of developing cancers (skin, bladder, lung)'

description: Arsenic contamination in drinking water supplies creates significant carcinogenic risk for
  populations. This systematic review found that 58.82% of water samples in Iran showed arsenic levels
  creating cancer risk exceeding the acceptable threshold of 1.00E-04 for both adult and child consumers.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Significant variation across cities and villages in Iran; 58.82% of samples for both
    adults and children showed carcinogenic risk (CR) of arsenic exceeding 1.00E-04 threshold indicating
    significant cancer risk

  description: Children showed different hazard quotient rankings compared to adults (Cd>As>Cr>Pb>Li for
    children vs As>Cr>Pb>Fe=Zn=Cu>Cd for adults), suggesting differential vulnerability

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Heavy metal concentrations varied significantly by location, with some cities and villages
    exceeding WHO and Iranian standards while others remained within safe limits
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how inadequate water infrastructure and regulatory
    enforcement in developing countries creates differential exposure to carcinogens. The contamination
    is a structural issue related to industrial regulation, water treatment infrastructure investment,
    and environmental policy enforcement rather than individual behavior. Populations in areas with poor
    water infrastructure bear disproportionate cancer risk.
