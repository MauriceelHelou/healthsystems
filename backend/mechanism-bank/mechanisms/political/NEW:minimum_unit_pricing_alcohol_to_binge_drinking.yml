direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing (MUP) policy establishes a floor price below which alcohol cannot be sold'
- 'Step 2: This disproportionately increases prices of cheap, high-strength alcohol products favored by
  heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Price increases reduce affordability of alcohol for price-sensitive consumers'
- 'Step 4: Reduced affordability leads to decreased purchasing and consumption of alcohol'
- 'Step 5: Lower consumption translates to reduced binge drinking episodes'

description: Systematic review meeting all nine Bradford Hill criteria for causality found that minimum
  unit pricing policies reduce alcohol consumption. The mechanism operates through increasing the price
  floor for cheap alcohol products, thereby reducing affordability and subsequent purchasing and consumption
  behaviors.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies included peer-reviewed research and grey literature from multiple jurisdictions;
    evidence base largely produced by small number of research teams suggesting geographic concentration
    of evidence

  description: Heavy drinkers who consume cheap alcohol are more affected by minimum pricing as they purchase
    larger volumes of low-cost products

  description: Price-sensitive populations show greater reductions in consumption in response to price
    increases
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses alcohol harm through population-level policy intervention
    rather than individual behavior change approaches. MUP is a structural intervention that modifies
    the commercial environment. The policy specifically targets cheap, high-strength products which are
    disproportionately consumed by heavy drinkers and lower-income populations, raising equity considerations
    about differential impact.
