direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Kratom manufacturing and sale lack regulatory oversight in the US'
- 'Step 2: Product quality, purity, and potency vary widely without standardization'
- 'Step 3: Contamination and adulteration risks increase without quality controls'
- 'Step 4: Unregulated products increase risk of adverse effects and dependence'

description: The absence of federal regulation of kratom manufacturing creates product quality and safety
  concerns that increase risk of adverse effects
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Regulatory status varies by country and by US state; some states have banned kratom
    while others have no restrictions

  description: States with kratom regulations may have reduced adverse effect risks through quality controls
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Regulatory gaps reflect policy failures at the federal level that leave consumers
    unprotected. The burden of harm from unregulated products falls disproportionately on those seeking
    alternatives to conventional treatment—often marginalized populations with limited healthcare access.
