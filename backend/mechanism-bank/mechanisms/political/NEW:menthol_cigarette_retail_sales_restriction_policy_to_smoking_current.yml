direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy restricts retail sales of menthol cigarettes to prevent initiation and promote quitting'
- 'Step 2: 54.5% of retailers believed customers would stop smoking altogether following the ban'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to preferred menthol products may prompt cessation'
- 'Step 4: However, continued availability undermines this pathway, maintaining smoking rates'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This policy intervention represents a structural approach to reducing tobacco use
    disparities by targeting the retail environment rather than individual behavior change. The mechanism
    acknowledges that commercial environments shape health behaviors and that addressing structural factors
    is necessary for equity.
