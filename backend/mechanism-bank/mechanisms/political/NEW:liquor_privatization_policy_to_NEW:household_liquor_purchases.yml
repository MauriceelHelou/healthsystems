direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State policy (Initiative 1183) transfers liquor retail from state-controlled stores to private
  retailers'
- 'Step 2: Privatization dramatically increases the number of retail outlets selling liquor (increased
  physical access)'
- 'Step 3: Greater geographic availability and extended hours of operation reduce barriers to purchase'
- 'Step 4: Despite new fees on retailers/distributors, increased competition and convenience drive purchasing
  behavior'
- 'Step 5: Household liquor purchases increase substantially (82% increase in monthly liquor ounces)'

description: Washington's Initiative 1183 privatizing liquor sales was associated with a 6.34-ounce increase
  in monthly household liquor purchases (approximately 82% increase) compared to control states, demonstrating
  how alcohol retail policy directly shapes population-level alcohol availability and purchasing

  description: Low and moderate alcohol purchasers increased monthly ethanol purchases while high purchasers
    decreased purchases, suggesting differential response by baseline consumption patterns
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces health-relevant behavior (alcohol purchasing) to state-level
    policy decisions about alcohol retail structure. The policy change represents a structural determinant
    that affects entire populations through environmental availability rather than individual choice.
    Equity implications include differential effects across consumption levels - concerning that low/moderate
    purchasers increased consumption while only high purchasers decreased
