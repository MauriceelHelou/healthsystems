description: JDTCs examined effects on substance use outcomes as a primary outcome, with the meta-analysis
  finding variability in effects. The overall certainty of evidence for substance use outcomes was rated
  as low or very low, with effectiveness potentially improved when services are better matched to youth
  treatment needs.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Youth substance use often emerges from structural factors including trauma, poverty,
    family instability, and community disinvestment. While JDTCs attempt to address substance use through
    treatment, their effectiveness depends on whether they can connect youth to appropriate services that
    address underlying structural determinants. The finding that better treatment matching improves outcomes
    suggests current systems may not adequately assess and respond to individual needs shaped by structural
    context.
