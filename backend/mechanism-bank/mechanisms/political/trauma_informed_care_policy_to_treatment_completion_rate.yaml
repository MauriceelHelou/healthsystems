description: Trauma-informed care policies improve treatment completion rates by creating
  supportive environments that address underlying trauma. The primary evidence shows
  a 5.37-fold increase in odds of program completion for patients receiving trauma-informed
  care. Supporting studies demonstrate that trauma-informed approaches increase engagement
  through culturally appropriate care, social supports, and recognition of trauma's
  impact on treatment adherence.
structural_competency_notes: Policy implementation requires systemic changes including
  provider training, organizational culture shifts, and integration of social determinants
  of health considerations. Success depends on addressing structural barriers like
  housing instability and improving access to comprehensive services within existing
  healthcare systems.
