description: The paper argues that incarceration is inappropriate for individuals whose offending behavior
  stems from neurological conditions or iatrogenic medication effects, as it hinders rehabilitation and
  fails to address the underlying condition. Non-custodial treatment in specialized facilities is proposed
  as an alternative.

  equity_implications: This mechanism directly addresses structural issues in the criminal justice system.
    The paper critiques the one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing that ignores the medical/neurological
    basis of some offenses. The structural solution involves reforming forensic assessment practices to
    incorporate neuropsychological and neuroimaging evidence, and creating specialized treatment facilities
    as alternatives to incarceration. This represents a shift from punitive to therapeutic approaches
    for medically-based behavioral disorders.
