category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy restricts days or hours when alcohol can be legally sold (e.g.,
  eliminating sales one day per week)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced availability creates temporal barriers to alcohol purchase and
  acquisition'
- 'Step 3: Barriers limit spontaneous and convenience purchasing opportunities, particularly
  for unplanned consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced purchasing opportunities translate to lower overall population
  consumption levels'
