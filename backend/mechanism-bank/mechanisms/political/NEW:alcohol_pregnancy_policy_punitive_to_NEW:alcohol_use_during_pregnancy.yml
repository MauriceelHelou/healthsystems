direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State implements punitive policies targeting alcohol use during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Policies drive pregnant women away from healthcare settings where they might receive intervention'
- 'Step 3: Reduced contact with healthcare providers limits opportunities for screening and brief intervention'
- 'Step 4: No clear reduction in alcohol use during pregnancy; policies fail to achieve intended behavioral
  change'

description: Punitive alcohol/pregnancy policies do not consistently reduce alcohol use during pregnancy,
  failing to achieve their primary intended effect while producing harmful unintended consequences on
  birth outcomes and prenatal care.

  variation_notes: No consistent pattern of policy effects on alcohol use during pregnancy across states.

  description: Although associations between policies and alcohol use during pregnancy varied by education,
    there was no clear pattern, suggesting education does not consistently moderate this relationship.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding is critical for understanding policy effectiveness - punitive approaches
    fail to change the targeted behavior while creating collateral harms. This supports harm reduction
    and supportive policy approaches over criminalization. The lack of education-based pattern suggests
    these policies are ineffective across social strata.
