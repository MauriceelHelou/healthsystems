description: Local licensing boards in Scotland prioritize economic growth in their decision-making about
  alcohol premises licensing. This economic orientation can lead to increased alcohol availability despite
  national public health objectives. Public health actors identified this prioritization as a key challenge
  to implementing health-protective alcohol policies at the local level.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how local governance structures can systematically favor
    commercial interests over population health. The structural arrangement of giving local boards autonomy
    while they prioritize economic development creates conditions for increased alcohol availability.
    This is a political economy analysis that traces health-relevant outcomes to governance structures
    rather than individual choices.
