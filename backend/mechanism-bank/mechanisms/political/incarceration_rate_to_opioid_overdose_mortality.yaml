category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High incarceration rates concentrate individuals with opioid use disorder
  (OUD) within the criminal justice system, where treatment access is often limited
  or absent'
- 'Step 2: During incarceration, opioid tolerance decreases significantly due to forced
  abstinence without medication-assisted treatment (MAT)'
- 'Step 3: Upon release, individuals face disrupted social determinants of health
  including housing instability, unemployment, and fractured social support networks'
- 'Step 4: The combination of reduced tolerance, limited post-release care continuity,
  and competing SDOH priorities creates extremely high overdose vulnerability'
- 'Step 5: Post-release mortality rate is approximately 13 times higher than general
  population, with opioids contributing to nearly half of all overdose deaths in this
  period'

description: Incarceration increases opioid overdose mortality through multiple interconnected
  pathways. The incarcerated population experiences forced abstinence that reduces
  opioid tolerance without adequate medication-assisted treatment. Upon release, individuals
  face dramatically elevated mortality risk (13 times higher than general population),
  with opioids contributing to approximately 1 in 8 post-release fatalities overall
  and nearly half of all overdose deaths. This risk is compounded by disrupted social
  determinants of health including housing, employment, and healthcare access. The
  systematic review found that while medication treatment throughout incarceration
  improves outcomes, most correctional systems lack comprehensive OUD treatment and
  SDOH-integrated interventions.
