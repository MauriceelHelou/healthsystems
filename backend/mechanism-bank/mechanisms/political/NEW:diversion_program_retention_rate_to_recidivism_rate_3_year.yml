mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals released from jail are enrolled in diversion programs'
- 'Step 2: Those retained in programs receive sustained support services over time'
- 'Step 3: Continuous engagement allows addressing of complex needs including substance use and mental
  health'
- 'Step 4: Sustained support builds stability in housing, employment, and social connections'
- 'Step 5: Higher retention rates translate to dramatically lower recidivism rates'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that non-retention leads to worse outcomes than no program at all suggests
    structural barriers to retention must be addressed. Simply offering programs is insufficient - structural
    supports enabling sustained participation (transportation, childcare, housing stability, treatment
    access) are essential. This shifts focus from individual 'compliance' to system capacity.
