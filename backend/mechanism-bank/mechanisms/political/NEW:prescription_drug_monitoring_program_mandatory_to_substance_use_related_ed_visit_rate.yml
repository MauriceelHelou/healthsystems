direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory prescription drug monitoring restricts access to prescription opioids for people
  with opioid dependence'
- 'Step 2: Patients unable to access prescription opioids may substitute with other substances to manage
  withdrawal or pain'
- 'Step 3: Non-opioid substances including illicit drugs or other medications may have different safety
  profiles'
- 'Step 4: Initial substitution behavior leads to increased non-opioid substance-related adverse events'
- 'Step 5: Transient increase in non-opioid substance-related ED presentations observed immediately after
  policy implementation'

description: 'The immediate change in non-opioid substance-related ED presentation rate was greater for
  the opioid group than the control group (β=11.1 presentations per 100,000 patients; 95% CI: 1.7-20.5).
  However, by March 2022, this rate had declined to below pre-intervention levels, indicating a transient
  substitution effect that resolved.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This finding highlights a critical equity consideration in supply-restriction
    policies: reducing access without adequate treatment alternatives may initially increase other substance-related
    harms. The structural competency lens recognizes that people with opioid use disorder may not have
    access to medication-assisted treatment, forcing substitution. The transient nature suggests systems
    adapted or patients accessed alternative supports.'
