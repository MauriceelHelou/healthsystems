direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Comprehensive ban covers main NCD risk factor products (food, alcohol, tobacco) across all
  media and age groups'
- 'Step 2: Reduced population exposure to marketing of unhealthy products decreases consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods reduces major NCD risk factors'
- 'Step 4: Reduced risk factor prevalence translates to decreased NCD incidence and mortality'

  equity_implications: Addresses commercial determinants of NCDs through upstream policy intervention.
    Recognizes industry marketing as structural driver of disease burden. Comprehensive policy approach
    targets multiple risk factors simultaneously, addressing root commercial causes rather than individual
    behaviors. Equity implications include protecting vulnerable populations from predatory marketing.
