mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Studies use inconsistent definitions and measures of SDoH constructs'
- 'Step 2: Data sources vary from EMR to surveys to disease registries without standardization'
- 'Step 3: Heterogeneous measurement prevents meta-analytic synthesis and effect estimation'
- 'Step 4: Inability to replicate findings across studies and populations'
- 'Step 5: Insufficient evidence base to design and implement effective interventions'

description: The systematic review found that inconsistent measurement and deployment of SDoH variables
  across 59 studies prevented clear conclusions about mechanisms and intervention targets, calling for
  validated measures collected prospectively
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects of SDoH on HF outcomes were inconsistent because of heterogeneity of data sources
    and SDoH constructs across geographic and healthcare contexts

  description: Linked EMR-survey data may improve measurement but increases complexity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This meta-mechanism identifies how research infrastructure and standardization
    (or lack thereof) constitute structural barriers to health equity. The review's call for validated,
    prospectively collected SDoH measures represents a structural intervention at the research enterprise
    level. Without standardized measurement, evidence-based policy cannot address root causes of HF disparities.
