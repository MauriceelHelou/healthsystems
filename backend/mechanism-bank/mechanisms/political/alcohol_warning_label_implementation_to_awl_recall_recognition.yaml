mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy implementation places warning labels on alcohol products creating
  ubiquitous information environment'
- 'Step 2: Consumers are repeatedly exposed to warning messages during purchase and
  consumption occasions'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure increases cognitive encoding and memory consolidation
  of warning content'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced recall and recognition of warnings maintains salience of health
  risk information over time'
