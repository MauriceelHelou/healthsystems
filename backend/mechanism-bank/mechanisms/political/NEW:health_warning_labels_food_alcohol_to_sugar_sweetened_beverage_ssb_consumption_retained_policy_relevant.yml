direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Health warning labels are applied to sugar-sweetened beverages highlighting health risks'
- 'Step 2: Labels increase consumer awareness of association between SSBs and obesity, diabetes, dental
  disease'
- 'Step 3: Point-of-purchase information disrupts automatic purchasing and consumption habits'
- 'Step 4: Reduced selection of SSBs at retail decreases consumption frequency'
- 'Step 5: Decreased SSB consumption reduces caloric intake and metabolic disease risk'

description: Health warning labels on food products including sugar-sweetened beverages reduced selection
  by 26%. With 11 RCTs examining food products, there is substantial evidence that labeling interventions
  can shift consumer behavior toward healthier choices.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: SSB warning labels address the commercial determinants of health by countering
    extensive beverage industry marketing. This policy approach recognizes that obesity and diabetes epidemics
    are driven by environmental factors including ubiquitous marketing, supersized portions, and strategic
    product placement rather than individual willpower failures. Warning labels can help restore information
    balance and are particularly relevant for communities targeted by predatory marketing practices.
