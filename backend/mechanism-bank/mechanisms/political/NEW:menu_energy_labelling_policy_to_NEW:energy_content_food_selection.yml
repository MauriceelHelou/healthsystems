- 'Step 1: Energy labelling policies implemented in real-world food service settings'
- 'Step 2: Pre-post implementation studies capture actual purchasing behavior changes'
- 'Step 3: Consumers in naturalistic settings encounter calorie information during routine purchases'
- 'Step 4: Real-world constraints (time pressure, habit, availability) may limit information processing'
- 'Step 5: Minimal to no change in energy content of actual food purchases observed'

description: 'Meta-analysis of 3 pre-post implementation field studies examining real-world effects of
  energy labelling. In higher SEP populations, effect was SMD=0.032 [95% CI: -0.053 to 0.117]. In lower
  SEP populations, effect was SMD=-0.005 [95% CI: -0.051 to 0.041]. Neither effect was statistically significant
  and they did not differ from each other.'

  description: In real-world field studies, effect did not differ by SEP (χ²(1)=0.22, p=.636). Higher

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Real-world implementation studies are critical for understanding structural policy
    effects. The near-zero effects in field studies (compared to small effects in experimental studies
    with hypothetical choices) suggest that information-based policies alone may be insufficient to change
    behavior when structural barriers to healthy eating (cost, availability, time constraints) remain
    unaddressed. The finding that lower SEP showed essentially no effect (SMD=-0.005) while not statistically
    different from higher SEP, raises concerns about whether information-based policies can address diet-related
    health inequities without accompanying structural changes.
