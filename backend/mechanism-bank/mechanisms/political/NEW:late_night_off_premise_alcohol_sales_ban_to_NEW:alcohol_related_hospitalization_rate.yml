mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy restricts sale of alcoholic beverages in off-premise outlets (kiosks, petrol stations,
  supermarkets) between 10pm and 5am'
- 'Step 2: Reduced late-night alcohol availability limits spontaneous alcohol purchases during high-risk
  drinking hours'
- 'Step 3: Decreased access to alcohol during nighttime hours reduces binge drinking episodes among youth
  and young adults'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of acute alcohol intoxication and alcohol poisoning result in fewer emergency hospitalizations'

description: A ban on late-night off-premise alcohol sales (10pm-5am) implemented in Baden-Württemberg,
  Germany in March 2010 reduced alcohol-related hospitalizations among adolescents and young adults by
  approximately 9%. This structural policy intervention restricts alcohol availability during high-risk
  hours without requiring individual behavior change.

    binge drinking and purchase alcohol from off-premise outlets late at night
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention - rather than targeting individual
    drinking behavior through education or persuasion, the policy changes the commercial environment to
    reduce alcohol availability during high-risk periods. The intervention is described as 'costless'
    public health initiative, highlighting how structural changes can be more efficient than individual-level
    interventions. This approach avoids blaming youth for binge drinking and instead modifies the commercial
    determinants of health. The policy addresses root causes (alcohol availability) rather than proximate
    symptoms (individual drinking decisions).
