mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco control laws establish requirements for sales practices (e.g., ban on sales to/by minors)'
- 'Step 2: Vendor awareness of these policies is necessary for compliance'
- 'Step 3: Low awareness (only 21% aware of ban on sales to/by minors) leads to widespread non-compliance'
- 'Step 4: Non-compliance maintains youth access to tobacco products'

description: Low awareness of tobacco control policies among naswar vendors leads to poor compliance with
  regulations, particularly the ban on sales to/by minors (76% violated this policy). Only 21% of vendors
  were aware of the minor sales ban, the highest awareness of any policy.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural failures in policy implementation and enforcement
    rather than individual vendor behavior. The study reveals systemic gaps in policy dissemination, particularly
    in rural areas where enforcement infrastructure may be weaker. The focus on vendor compliance shifts
    attention to the regulatory environment that enables continued tobacco access.
