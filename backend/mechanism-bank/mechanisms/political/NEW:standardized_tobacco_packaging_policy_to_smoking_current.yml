direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized packaging removes brand logos, colors, and promotional design elements from tobacco
  products'
- 'Step 2: Reduced visual appeal decreases the attractiveness and perceived status associated with smoking'
- 'Step 3: Increased salience of health warnings on plain packs enhances awareness of health risks'
- 'Step 4: Reduced product appeal and increased risk perception contribute to decreased smoking prevalence
  at population level'

description: Standardized tobacco packaging policy, which mandates uniform coloring and removes brand
  imagery, was associated with a 3.7% reduction in odds of smoking (0.5 percentage point drop in prevalence)
  in Australia one year after implementation. This structural intervention removes marketing influence
  from tobacco products.

  variation_notes: Evidence primarily from Australia, the first country to implement standardized packaging;
    France implemented in 2017; generalizability to other countries remains to be determined

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Dark colors for uniform pack color appeared more effective at reducing misperceptions that
    some cigarettes are less harmful than others
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural policy intervention that removes corporate
    marketing influence rather than focusing on individual behavior change. It addresses the commercial
    determinants of health by limiting tobacco industry promotional tactics. The policy approach recognizes
    that individual smoking decisions are shaped by environmental and commercial factors.
