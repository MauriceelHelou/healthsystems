description: Complier Average Causal Effects (CACE) analysis indicated that assignment to MARI among individuals
  who would complete the program if assigned lowered the adjusted odds of 6-month recidivism (aOR=0.85,
  95% CI 0.80-0.90, p<0.001). This represents a 15% reduction in recidivism odds for compliers.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The CACE analysis reveals that even accounting for selection effects, structural
    provision of treatment access causally reduces recidivism. This supports policy arguments for expanding
    diversion programs as a structural intervention. The difference between ITT and CACE estimates suggests
    that improving program completion rates through addressing structural barriers could enhance population-level
    impact.
