  of fiber'', ''heart healthy'')'
- 'Step 2: Positive health claims create favorable associations with labeled products'

  equity_implications: Promotion-focused labeling can make healthier options more visible and attractive
    within the retail environment. However, equity implications include that health claims may be used
    more on premium products, potentially creating a 'health halo' that benefits higher-income consumers
    with access to these products. Additionally, health claims can be used on ultra-processed 'health
    foods' that may not represent overall dietary improvement.
