description: This systematic review demonstrates efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapies, providing
  evidence that can inform regulatory policy decisions. The existence of 30 RCTs indicates evolving regulatory
  frameworks that permit research, with implications for future clinical access.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Drug scheduling and regulatory frameworks are structural determinants of healthcare
    access. Historical criminalization of psychedelics has created decades of research gaps and prevented
    access to potentially beneficial treatments. Regulatory changes occur unevenly across jurisdictions,
    creating geographic disparities in access. The policy environment shapes who can access these emerging
    treatments, with implications for health equity given differential mental health burden across populations.
