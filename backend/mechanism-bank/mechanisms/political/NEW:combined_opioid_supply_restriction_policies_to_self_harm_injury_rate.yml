- 'Step 1: Combined prescription drug monitoring and PBS restrictions reduce prescription opioid availability'
- 'Step 2: Policy implementation does not appear to cause significant psychological distress leading to
  self-harm'
- 'Step 3: Differences between opioid and control groups in self-harm presentations were not statistically
  significant'
- 'Step 4: Supply restriction policies do not appear to increase self-harm related hospital presentations'

description: Differences between the opioid and control groups in changes to self-harm-related presentations
  were not statistically significant, suggesting that opioid supply restriction policies did not increase
  self-harm among people prescribed opioids.

  equity_implications: This null finding is important for policy evaluation - a key concern with opioid
    restriction policies is potential for increased mental health crises if patients lose access to pain
    management or develop withdrawal. The lack of increased self-harm suggests adequate transition supports
    or that the policies did not create acute psychological distress requiring emergency intervention.
