direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regulatory standards (WHO guidelines, Iranian Standard 1053) establish permissible limits for
  heavy metals in drinking water'
- 'Step 2: Weak enforcement or inadequate standards allow water supplies to exceed safe thresholds for
  Cr, Pb, Ba, Al, As, Zn, and Cd'
- 'Step 3: Water treatment infrastructure investment priorities are shaped by regulatory requirements'
- 'Step 4: Communities served by non-compliant water systems experience elevated contaminant exposure'

description: The systematic review found that average concentrations of seven heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Ba,
  Al, As, Zn, Cd) exceeded permissible limits set by WHO and Iranian Standard 1053, indicating gaps between
  regulatory standards and actual water quality achieved.

  description: Developing country context noted as particularly concerning for water contamination, suggesting
    resource constraints affect regulatory enforcement capacity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how regulatory infrastructure and enforcement capacity
    are structural determinants of population health. The gap between established standards and actual
    water quality reflects political and economic decisions about resource allocation for water treatment
    and monitoring systems. Developing country status creates systematic disadvantage in achieving water
    quality goals.
