direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local government implements cumulative impact zones restricting new alcohol licenses in saturated
  areas'
- 'Step 2: Combined with increased licensing enforcement, this reduces alcohol outlet density and availability'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol availability decreases population-level alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption leads to reduced acute alcohol-related harms requiring hospitalization'
- 'Step 5: Hospital admissions for alcohol-related conditions decline at community level'

description: Local alcohol licensing policies combining cumulative impact zones with increased enforcement
  were associated with a 6.3% average reduction in alcohol-related hospital admissions compared to expected
  trends in control areas. This represents a structural intervention at the local government level that
  modifies the alcohol environment rather than targeting individual behavior.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention - local governments using regulatory
    authority to modify the built and commercial environment. The policy addresses upstream determinants
    (alcohol availability) rather than downstream individual behaviors. The natural experiment design
    provides evidence that policy-level changes can produce population health improvements. Equity implications
    include potential differential effects in areas with high outlet density, which often correlates with
    lower-income neighborhoods.
