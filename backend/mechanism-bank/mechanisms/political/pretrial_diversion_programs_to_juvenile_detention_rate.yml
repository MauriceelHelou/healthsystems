- 'Step 1: Police-initiated diversion provides an alternative option between ignoring youth misconduct
  and formally charging youth with crimes'
- 'Step 2: Youth who would otherwise be formally charged are instead diverted from court processing'
- 'Step 3: Diversion prevents deeper penetration into the criminal justice system pipeline'
- 'Step 4: Reduced formal processing leads to fewer youth entering the detention system'

description: Police-led diversion programs serve as a structural mechanism to reduce youth contact with
  the formal justice system. By providing police with options beyond formal charging, these programs prevent
  youth from entering the detention pipeline, thereby reducing overall detention rates for minor offenses.

  description: Diversion is specifically recommended for low-risk youth; effectiveness may differ for
    higher-risk populations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural overuse of formal justice processing for
    minor youth misconduct. The review acknowledges that minor delinquent behavior is normative in adolescence,
    particularly for boys, yet the system response can be disproportionate and harmful. Diversion represents
    a policy-level intervention that changes system incentives and options rather than focusing on changing
    individual youth behavior. This has significant equity implications as minority youth face higher
    rates of formal processing for similar behaviors.
