direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy eliminates legal sale of alcohol at off-premise outlets during nighttime hours (10pm-5am)'
- 'Step 2: Youth and young adults face increased barriers to obtaining additional alcohol during peak
  social drinking periods'
- 'Step 3: Reduced spontaneous alcohol availability interrupts escalation from moderate to heavy drinking
  episodes'
- 'Step 4: Overall reduction in high-risk drinking patterns among adolescents and young adults'

description: Restricting hours during which alcohol can be sold at off-premise outlets reduces binge drinking
  among youth and young adults by limiting access to alcohol during high-risk nighttime hours when excessive
  consumption is most likely.

  variation_notes: Effect measured in German context where off-premise sales at kiosks and petrol stations
    are common; may differ in jurisdictions with different retail alcohol environments

  description: Policy specifically targets off-premise outlets (kiosks, petrol stations, supermarkets)
    which may be preferred sources for spontaneous late-night purchases by youth
- name: time_restriction_hours
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Restriction covers 10pm-5am, capturing peak late-night drinking hours when binge drinking
    is most likely to occur
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism operates at the commercial/regulatory level, modifying the retail
    environment rather than individual decision-making. It recognizes that youth binge drinking is shaped
    by structural availability factors, not simply individual choice. The policy shifts responsibility
    from individuals to the regulatory environment, representing a structural competency approach. Equity
    implications: Such policies may have differential effects by socioeconomic status depending on access
    to alternative alcohol sources (e.g., bars, restaurants) and enforcement patterns across neighborhoods.'
