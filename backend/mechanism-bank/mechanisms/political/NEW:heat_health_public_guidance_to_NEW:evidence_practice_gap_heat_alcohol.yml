mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current heat-health advisories warn against alcohol consumption during hot weather and heatwaves'
- 'Step 2: These recommendations are based on assumptions about alcohol impairing thermoregulation and
  causing dehydration'
- 'Step 3: Available experimental evidence from controlled studies does not support impaired physiological
  responses in young healthy males'
- 'Step 4: Evidence gap exists because research has not included vulnerable populations (elderly, women,
  those with chronic conditions)'
- 'Step 5: Policy recommendations may not be evidence-based for general population but could still be
  appropriate for vulnerable subgroups'

description: This systematic review identifies a significant evidence-practice gap in heat-health guidance
  regarding alcohol consumption. While current public health advisories warn against alcohol during heat
  events, the experimental evidence does not support impaired thermoregulatory responses to heat with
  moderate alcohol consumption - at least in young healthy males. The review highlights that research
  is limited by moderate doses, short exposure durations, and exclusively young male participants.

    geographic variation in heat exposure, housing quality, or population vulnerability

  description: Controlled laboratory conditions with average 70-minute exposure may not reflect extended
    real-world heat exposures during heat waves
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism has important structural and equity implications. Heat-related mortality
    is concentrated among elderly, socially isolated individuals, those with chronic conditions, and populations
    without access to air conditioning - groups entirely absent from the evidence base. Structural factors
    including housing quality, access to cooling centers, neighborhood heat island effects, and occupational
    exposure determine heat vulnerability far more than individual alcohol consumption. Public health
    messaging should be evidence-based while acknowledging that different recommendations may be appropriate
    for different populations based on underlying vulnerability. The absence of research in vulnerable
    populations itself reflects structural inequities in research priorities and funding.
