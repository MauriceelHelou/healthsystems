mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of alcohol warning label policies mandates or encourages
  placement of health warning messages on alcohol containers at point of purchase
  and consumption'
- 'Step 2: Warning labels increase visibility and salience of health risk information,
  leading to greater exposure to and noticing of alcohol-related health warnings among
  consumers'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure to and processing of warning label content enhances
  population-level awareness and knowledge of alcohol health risks, including cancer
  risks and other health consequences'

description: Alcohol health warning label policies increase population awareness of
  alcohol health risks through mandatory or voluntary placement of health warning
  messages on alcohol containers. These labels serve as point-of-purchase and consumption
  cues that increase exposure to health risk information. Evidence shows that greater
  proportions of target populations, including heavy drinkers, report seeing warning
  labels after implementation. The labels enhance knowledge and awareness of specific
  health risks mentioned on the warnings, including cancer risks, pregnancy-related
  harms, and drunk driving dangers. Systematic reviews demonstrate that labels increase
  salience and effectiveness of health warnings in terms of recall, attention, believability
  and seriousness of health risks.
structural_competency_notes: The effectiveness of alcohol warning label policies is
  influenced by regulatory frameworks, industry compliance, label design specifications
  mandated by policy, and integration with broader alcohol control strategies. Industry
  interference can limit policy implementation and effectiveness, as demonstrated
  in real-world studies where alcohol industry complaints led to modifications or
  removal of warning labels.
