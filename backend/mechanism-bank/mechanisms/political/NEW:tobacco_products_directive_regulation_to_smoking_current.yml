description: An unexpected finding was that smoking decline appeared to plateau as e-cigarette use growth
  stalled following TPD implementation. While smoking continued its pre-existing decline initially, the
  rate of decline slowed for regular use. This suggests potential complex interactions between e-cigarette
  and smoking regulation. The authors note this requires cautious interpretation given the observational
  design and inability to rule out alternative explanations.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the complexity of tobacco/nicotine policy and potential
    unintended consequences. Structural approaches to harm reduction must consider the interplay between
    different nicotine products and their regulatory environments. The finding suggests that overly restrictive
    e-cigarette policies might inadvertently slow smoking decline progress, raising equity concerns if
    lower-income populations have fewer smoking cessation alternatives. Policy approaches should balance
    e-cigarette youth access prevention with adult harm reduction opportunities.
