description: Most vendors (71%) violated the ban on promotion of naswar, indicating weak enforcement of
  tobacco advertising restrictions. This structural failure in policy implementation allows continued
  tobacco marketing that normalizes use and maintains demand.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The high rate of promotion ban violations reflects systemic enforcement failures
    rather than individual vendor malfeasance. The retail environment remains a key point for tobacco
    marketing when policy enforcement is inadequate, creating ongoing population-level exposure to tobacco
    promotion.
