mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP increases cost of cheap, high-alcohol content beverages'
- 'Step 2: Heavy drinkers reduce consumption due to price sensitivity for these products'
- 'Step 3: Sustained reduction in heavy alcohol consumption decreases ongoing liver damage'
- 'Step 4: Over 2-3 years, reduced cumulative liver injury decreases chronic liver disease progression'
- 'Step 5: Fewer hospitalizations for alcohol-related liver disease including cirrhosis'

description: MUP reduces chronic alcohol-related hospitalizations including liver disease through sustained
  reduction in heavy alcohol consumption. Unlike acute admissions which respond immediately, chronic conditions
  like liver disease show a 2-3 year lag with 4-9% annual reductions observed after this period.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural alcohol policy interventions can prevent
    the accumulation of biological damage over time. The lagged effect reflects the pathophysiology of
    liver disease while the intervention addresses upstream commercial determinants. This approach avoids
    blaming individuals for addiction while acknowledging that sustained environmental changes can prevent
    progressive organ damage.
