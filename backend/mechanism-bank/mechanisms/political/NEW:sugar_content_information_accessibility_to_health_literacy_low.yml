mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standard nutrition labels present sugar content in grams, which is difficult to interpret without
  nutritional knowledge'
- 'Step 2: Teaspoon-based labeling translates abstract gram measurements into familiar household units'
- 'Step 3: Improved comprehension of sugar quantities reduces health literacy barriers to informed decision-making'
- 'Step 4: More equitable access to actionable health information across education levels'

description: Converting sugar content from grams to teaspoons makes nutritional information more accessible
  and interpretable, potentially reducing health literacy barriers and enabling more informed consumer
  choices across education levels.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural health literacy inequities. Traditional nutrition
    labeling systems require specialized knowledge (understanding grams, daily value percentages) that
    correlates with educational attainment. By translating information into universally understood units
    (teaspoons), policy can reduce knowledge barriers that perpetuate health disparities. This represents
    a structural approach to health equity - modifying the information environment rather than expecting
    individuals to acquire specialized knowledge.
