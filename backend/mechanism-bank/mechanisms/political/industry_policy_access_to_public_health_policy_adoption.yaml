  gain privileged access to policy-making processes'
- 'Step 2: Industry leverages economic power, political connections, and framing as
  legitimate stakeholders to secure seats at policy tables'
- 'Step 3: Direct industry involvement in policy development creates unacceptable
  conflicts of interest that bias policy outcomes toward industry interests'

  health policies'
- 'Step 5: Failed or diluted policy adoption maintains population exposure to health-harming
  products and practices'
