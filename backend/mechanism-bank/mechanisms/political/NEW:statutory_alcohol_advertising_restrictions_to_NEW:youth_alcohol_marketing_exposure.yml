  across most jurisdictions

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a protective structural intervention - statutory regulation
    as a policy tool to reduce population-level alcohol marketing exposure. The current absence of such
    frameworks represents a structural failure that maintains health inequities. This approach shifts
    responsibility from individuals to governmental institutions responsible for protecting public health.
