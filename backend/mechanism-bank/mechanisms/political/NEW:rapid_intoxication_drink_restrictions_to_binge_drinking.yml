mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Shots and rapid intoxication drinks banned after midnight in licensed venues'
- 'Step 2: Patrons anticipate reduced ability to consume high-alcohol beverages in venues'
- 'Step 3: Pre-drinking behavior intensifies to achieve desired intoxication before entry'
- 'Step 4: Consumption shifts from venue-controlled to uncontrolled private settings'
- 'Step 5: Overall intoxication increases as measured by breath alcohol at venue entry'

description: Restrictions on rapid intoxication drinks (shots) after midnight contributed to increased
  preloading behavior. Patrons surveyed before legislation predicted they would drink more before entering
  entertainment districts, and this prediction was confirmed by post-legislation breath alcohol data.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates predictable behavioral adaptation to alcohol product
    restrictions. The policy attempted to reduce intoxication velocity within venues but did not address
    the social and cultural drivers of hazardous drinking in nightlife settings. Young adults adapted
    their consumption patterns to maintain desired intoxication levels, highlighting the need for interventions
    addressing social norms rather than product availability alone.
