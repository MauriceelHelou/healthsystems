mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol taxation raises the retail prices of alcoholic beverages,
  creating economic barriers to consumption'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices reduce affordability and accessibility of alcohol, particularly
  affecting price-sensitive consumers including heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Economic constraints lead to decreased alcohol consumption and reduced
  prevalence of heavy drinking behaviors at the population level'

description: Alcohol taxation reduces heavy alcohol use prevalence through price mechanisms.
  A comprehensive meta-analysis of 112 studies found that alcohol taxes and prices
  are inversely related to drinking, with heavy drinking showing significant price
  responsiveness (elasticity = -0.28). The relationship operates through economic
  barriers that make alcohol less affordable and accessible, particularly affecting
  heavy drinkers who are price-sensitive consumers. Population-based taxation policies
  represent highly cost-effective interventions for reducing hazardous alcohol use.
structural_competency_notes: Taxation policies affect different socioeconomic groups
  differently, with price increases having greater impact on lower-income populations
  who may be more price-sensitive. However, taxation represents a population-wide
  structural intervention that addresses alcohol harm through economic policy rather
  than individual behavior change, making it particularly effective for addressing
  heavy drinking patterns across diverse demographic groups.
