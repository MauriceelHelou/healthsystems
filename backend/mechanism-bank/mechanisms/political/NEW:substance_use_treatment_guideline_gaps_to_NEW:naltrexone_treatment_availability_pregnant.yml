- 'Step 1: Absence of national guidelines for naltrexone use in pregnancy creates policy vacuum'
- 'Step 2: Providers lack institutional support and evidence-based protocols for treating pregnant patients'
- 'Step 3: Provider uncertainty and liability concerns reduce willingness to prescribe'
- 'Step 4: Fewer sites offer naltrexone to pregnant individuals'

description: The lack of national guidelines for using naltrexone in pregnant patients was identified
  as a barrier by 14.1% of responding providers, contributing to limited availability of this treatment
  option.

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a policy-level structural determinant. The absence of
    national guidelines represents a failure of medical institutions and regulatory bodies to provide
    adequate guidance for treating pregnant individuals with SUD. This policy gap places the burden on
    individual providers to navigate complex clinical decisions without institutional support, ultimately
    limiting patient access to potentially beneficial treatments. The structural solution requires investment
    in research and guideline development at the national level.
