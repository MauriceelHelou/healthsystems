mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-impaired drivers injured in motor vehicle collisions are brought to hospitals/trauma
  centers'
- 'Step 2: Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is measured but institutional procedures vary in obtaining
  legally admissible evidence'
- 'Step 3: Majority of intoxicated drivers (median 87%) are never charged or convicted for DUI/DWI'
- 'Step 4: Lack of legal consequences fails to deter future alcohol-impaired driving behavior'
- 'Step 5: Previous DUI/DWI offenders continue to drive while impaired, with 15.5% having prior convictions
  and 3.5% being reconvicted during study periods'

description: This systematic review found that the median DUI/DWI conviction rate for alcohol-impaired
  drivers injured in motor vehicle collisions was only 13% (range 0-85%), meaning the majority of intoxicated
  injured drivers face no legal consequences. A substantial proportion (median 15.5%) had previous DUI/DWI
  convictions, and 3.5% were reconvicted during study follow-up periods, indicating system failures in
  both initial prosecution and recidivism prevention.

  variation_notes: Substantial heterogeneity between study designs, legal jurisdictions, and institutional
    procedures for obtaining legally admissible BAC measurements precluded meta-analysis. Studies from
    USA (n=20), Canada (n=5), and Sweden (n=1) showed varying conviction rates.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights structural failures in the criminal justice and healthcare
    systems'' coordination. The low conviction rate reflects systemic issues including: (1) lack of standardized
    protocols for obtaining legally admissible BAC evidence in healthcare settings, (2) jurisdictional
    variations in DUI/DWI laws and enforcement, and (3) potential conflicts between healthcare providers''
    therapeutic obligations and law enforcement needs. The high rate of prior convictions among this population
    (15.5%) suggests these are not isolated incidents but rather reflect populations with alcohol use
    disorders who are inadequately connected to treatment. This is fundamentally a structural issue requiring
    policy coordination between healthcare, public health, and criminal justice systems rather than individual-level
    interventions.'
