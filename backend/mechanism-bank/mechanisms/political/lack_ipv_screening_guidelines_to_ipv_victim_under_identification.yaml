direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of standardized guidelines results in wide variation in screening
  practices across healthcare institutions'
- 'Step 2: Without institutional protocols, IPV screening relies on individual provider
  initiative and clinical suspicion'
- 'Step 3: Non-systematic approaches miss victims who do not present with obvious
  injury patterns or who do not disclose abuse spontaneously'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system fails to identify and connect IPV victims to resources,
  perpetuating cycles of violence and injury'
