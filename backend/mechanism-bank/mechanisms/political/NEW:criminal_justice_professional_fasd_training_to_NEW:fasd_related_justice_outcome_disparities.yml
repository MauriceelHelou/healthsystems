description: Training criminal justice and legal professionals on FASD can reduce adverse justice outcomes
  by implementing appropriate interview techniques and accommodations for individuals with neurodevelopmental
  deficits.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This represents a structural intervention that addresses system-level failures
    rather than placing burden on individuals with FASD. Training transforms institutional practices to
    accommodate neurodevelopmental differences, representing a shift from individual blame to structural
    accountability. Investment in such training is an equity-promoting policy intervention.
