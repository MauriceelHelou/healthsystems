description: Comprehensive bans on advertising of unhealthy products including alcohol aim to reduce consumption
  by eliminating marketing exposure. The study identifies external (political, social, economic), interorganizational
  (mission, communication), and internal (planning, organization, leadership, control) challenges to implementing
  such bans effectively.

  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately identifies policy-level intervention as a structural
    determinant. The study recognizes that multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests (industry
    vs. public health) create implementation challenges. The policy approach avoids individual blame by
    targeting the commercial determinants of health rather than consumer behavior.
