structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural regulatory failure rather than individual
    choice. The alcohol industry's self-regulation creates systematic exposure of youth to marketing,
    while governments fail to develop comprehensive statutory frameworks. This represents a policy-level
    determinant where corporate interests supersede public health protection, disproportionately affecting
    youth who lack agency to avoid digital marketing.
