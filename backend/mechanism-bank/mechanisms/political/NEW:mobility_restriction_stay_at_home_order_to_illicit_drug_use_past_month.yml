direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic necessitates public health infection control policies including stay-at-home
  orders'
- 'Step 2: Mobility restrictions limit access to social support networks, employment, and routine activities'
- 'Step 3: Confinement increases psychological distress, isolation, and boredom'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to behavioral health services and support systems during lockdown'
- 'Step 5: Increased drug use as coping mechanism for pandemic-related stress and isolation'

description: COVID-19 stay-at-home orders enacted from March to June 2020 were identified as a risk factor
  for drug use in the US general population. The study found that mobility restriction during national
  health crises had unintended consequences on substance use behaviors, highlighting the complex interplay
  between infection control policies and behavioral health outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately traces drug use to structural factors (pandemic policy)
    rather than individual moral failing. The study explicitly calls for further research on 'unintended
    consequences of infection control policies during national health crises,' recognizing that public
    health interventions can have differential impacts. The structural root cause is governmental pandemic
    response policy, with equity implications as the effects likely varied by socioeconomic status, housing
    stability, and pre-existing mental health conditions - all of which are structurally determined.
