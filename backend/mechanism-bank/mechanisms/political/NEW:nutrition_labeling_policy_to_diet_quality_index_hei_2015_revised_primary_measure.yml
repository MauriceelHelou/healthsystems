mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nutrition labeling policies mandate provision of easily interpretable nutritional information
  at point of purchase'
- 'Step 2: Labels provide consumers with accessible information about caloric content, nutrient composition,
  and health attributes'
- 'Step 3: Information accessibility at decision point enables informed food selection'
- 'Step 4: Repeated exposure to nutritional information shapes purchasing patterns toward healthier options'
- 'Step 5: Improved food purchasing patterns translate to better overall diet quality'

description: Second-order meta-analysis of 93 first-order meta-analysis effect sizes examining how nutrition
  labeling interventions affect consumer food choices. The analysis reveals heterogeneity in effects based
  on whether interventions aim to prevent unhealthy food consumption versus promote healthy food consumption.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately focuses on structural interventions (mandatory labeling
    policies) rather than individual behavior change. The policy-level intervention creates an information
    environment that shapes choices at the population level. Equity implications include potential differential
    effects based on health literacy, language access, and shopping environments. Food desert residents
    may have limited access to labeled products, and those with lower health literacy may benefit less
    from complex nutritional information. The mechanism traces to policy decisions about food system transparency
    rather than blaming individuals for poor dietary choices.
