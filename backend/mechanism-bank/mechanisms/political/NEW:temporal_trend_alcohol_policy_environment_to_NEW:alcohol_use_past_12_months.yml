- 'Step 1: Potential shifts in regional alcohol policies, availability, or enforcement over time'
- 'Step 2: Increased globalization and tourism may increase alcohol access in some countries'
- 'Step 3: Possible changes in social norms and attitudes toward alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Estimated prevalence approximately doubled from 2.9% (2016 WHO estimate) to 6.2% (current review)'

description: The review found a pooled 12-month alcohol use prevalence of 6.2%, approximately twice the
  2.9% estimated by WHO in 2016. The authors note this 'might show an increasing trend' in alcohol use
  in the region, potentially reflecting shifts in structural factors controlling alcohol availability
  and use.
spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: The apparent increase may reflect methodological differences between studies, improved
    surveillance, or true increases in prevalence across the region

  description: Differences in survey methods, sampling strategies, and reporting between WHO 2016 estimates
    and current systematic review may explain some of the difference
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: If this represents a true increase, it suggests that protective structural factors
    (cultural norms, legal restrictions) may be weakening over time. Policy implications include the need
    to maintain and strengthen evidence-based alcohol control policies in the region. However, methodological
    differences between studies must be considered.
