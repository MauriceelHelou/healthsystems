direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Health warning labels (HWLs) are mandated on food and alcohol products through policy intervention'
- 'Step 2: HWLs increase visibility and salience of health risks associated with product consumption at
  point of selection'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive processing of warning information triggers risk perception and health concerns'
- 'Step 4: Increased perceived risk reduces likelihood of selecting the labeled product'
- 'Step 5: Reduced selection translates to decreased purchase and consumption of harmful products'

description: Health warning labels on food and alcohol products reduce selection of targeted products
  by 26%. This meta-analysis of 14 RCTs found participants were significantly less likely to choose products
  displaying HWLs compared to products without HWLs.

  description: Image-and-text (pictorial) HWLs showed larger effect (RR=0.65, 95%CI 0.54-0.80) compared
    to text-only HWLs (RR=0.79, 95%CI 0.74-0.85), though difference not statistically significant
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural/policy-level intervention that modifies
    the information environment at point of purchase rather than relying on individual motivation or education.
    HWLs shift the default information landscape, reducing information asymmetry between industry and
    consumers. This approach addresses health inequities by providing universal access to health risk
    information regardless of education level or health literacy, though image-based warnings may be more
    equitable for populations with lower literacy.
