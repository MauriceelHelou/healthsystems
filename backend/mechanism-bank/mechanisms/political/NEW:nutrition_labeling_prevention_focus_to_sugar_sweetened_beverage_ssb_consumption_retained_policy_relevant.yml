direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prevention-focused nutrition labels highlight negative health attributes of foods (e.g., high
  sugar, high calorie warnings)'
- 'Step 2: Warning-style labels create cognitive friction and negative affect at point of purchase'
- 'Step 3: Consumers are deterred from selecting products with prominent warning labels'
- 'Step 4: Reduced selection of labeled unhealthy products including sugar-sweetened beverages'
- 'Step 5: Population-level reduction in consumption of targeted unhealthy food categories'

description: Prevention-focused nutrition labeling interventions that aim to reduce consumption of unhealthy
  foods show distinct effect patterns. These interventions use warning labels and negative health information
  to discourage selection of unhealthy options.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Prevention-focused labeling represents a structural approach to modifying the food
    environment rather than relying on individual willpower. This acknowledges that food industry marketing
    creates obesogenic environments, and policy interventions can counter these structural forces. Equity
    considerations include whether warning labels are effective across literacy levels and whether they
    inadvertently stigmatize foods consumed disproportionately by lower-income populations.
