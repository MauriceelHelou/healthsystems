direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smoking bans in institutional settings (prisons, mental health facilities, substance use treatment)
  enforce temporary abstinence during incarceration/hospitalization'
- 'Step 2: Enforced abstinence does not address underlying nicotine addiction or provide cessation skills/support'
- 'Step 3: Upon release/discharge, individuals return to environments where tobacco is accessible without
  transition support'
- 'Step 4: High relapse rates occur shortly after release due to stress, environmental cues, and lack
  of ongoing cessation support'
- 'Step 5: Smoking bans alone fail to produce long-term cessation without complementary multi-component
  interventions'

description: Smoking bans alone in carceral and institutional mental health/substance use settings do
  not promote long-term smoking cessation. People released from prison, mental health facilities, and
  substance use treatment settings who experience smoking bans while incarcerated or hospitalized often
  relapse to smoking shortly after release or discharge.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how punitive or restrictive policies (smoking bans) without
    supportive services fail to address health behaviors. The affected populations (incarcerated individuals,
    people with mental illness, people with substance use disorders) face structural vulnerabilities including
    stigma, limited resources, and social marginalization that make post-release cessation difficult.
    Policy approaches must incorporate wrap-around support services rather than relying solely on environmental
    restrictions.
