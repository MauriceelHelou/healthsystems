description: The sachet alcohol ban demonstrated near-complete effectiveness in eliminating sachet alcohol
  from retail establishments, reducing availability from 52% to 1.4% of establishments. This represents
  the primary target of the legislation and shows strong policy efficacy.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Sachet alcohol products are typically marketed to low-income populations due to
    their affordability and single-serving size. This structural intervention addresses health equity
    by targeting a product format that disproportionately affects economically vulnerable populations.
    The policy approach addresses upstream commercial determinants rather than individual consumer behavior.
