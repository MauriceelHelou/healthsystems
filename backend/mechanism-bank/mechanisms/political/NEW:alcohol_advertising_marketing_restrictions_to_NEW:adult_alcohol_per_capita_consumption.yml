mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy restricts alcohol advertising and marketing exposure'
- 'Step 2: Reduced normalization of alcohol consumption in media environment'
- 'Step 3: Gradual shift in cultural attitudes and social norms around drinking over mid- to long-term'
- 'Step 4: Population-level consumption may decrease through changed social norms (theorized, not confirmed)'

description: 'Restrictions on advertising and/or marketing showed no significant immediate association
  with alcohol per capita consumption (average effect 0.04 litres per year, 95% CI: -0.65 to 0.73). This
  WHO ''best buy'' policy may require longer time horizons to demonstrate effects on consumption through
  social norm changes.'

  description: The authors postulated that advertising restrictions would have mid- to long-term effects
    rather than immediate effects; the study may not have captured the full delayed impact
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism did not show immediate effects, the structural approach of
    modifying the information environment represents an upstream intervention targeting commercial determinants
    of health. The lack of immediate effect does not negate the policy's potential long-term value in
    denormalizing alcohol consumption across populations, particularly for youth who may be most susceptible
    to marketing exposure.
