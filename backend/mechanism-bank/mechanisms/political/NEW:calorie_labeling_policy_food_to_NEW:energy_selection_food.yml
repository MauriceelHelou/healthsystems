direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory calorie labeling policies require display of energy content on menus, menu boards,
  and food packaging'
- 'Step 2: Consumers are exposed to calorie information at point of purchase/selection in restaurants,
  cafeterias, and supermarkets'
- 'Step 3: Information availability enables comparison of energy content across food options'
- 'Step 4: Consumers incorporate calorie information into food selection decisions'
- 'Step 5: Average energy content of food selections decreases slightly at population level'

description: Calorie labeling on food menus, products, and packaging leads to a small but statistically
  significant reduction in energy selected. For an average 600 kcal meal, adults exposed to calorie labeling
  select approximately 11 kcal less (1.8% reduction). This represents high-certainty evidence from 16
  randomized studies.

  variation_notes: Studies conducted primarily in high-income countries (24/25 studies); 15 in USA, 6
    in UK, 1 each in Ireland, France, and Canada. Geographic variation in implementation settings (restaurants,
    cafeterias, supermarkets).
moderators:
- name: socioeconomic_status
  direction: unknown
  strength: moderate
  description: Most studies (18/25) conducted in high SES populations; only 1 study included only low
    SES participants. Further research needed to assess SES as moderator.
- name: label_type
  direction: unknown
  strength: weak
  description: Most studies assessed simple calorie labeling (20/25); some included additional nutrient
    information or physical activity calorie equivalent (PACE) labeling.
- name: setting
  direction: unknown
  strength: moderate
  description: 16/25 studies in real-world field settings (restaurants, cafeterias, supermarkets); 6 in
    naturalistic laboratories; 3 in laboratory settings.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural policy intervention that modifies the food
    environment rather than relying on individual education or willpower. By mandating information disclosure,
    the policy shifts responsibility from individuals to food providers and creates systemic change. However,
    equity concerns exist as most evidence comes from high-SES populations, and effects on low-SES groups
    remain unclear. The intervention may not address underlying structural drivers of food choice such
    as food access, affordability, and marketing of energy-dense foods.
