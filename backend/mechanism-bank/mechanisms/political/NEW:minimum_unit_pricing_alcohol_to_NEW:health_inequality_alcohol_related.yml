direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP sets floor price that most affects cheap, high-strength alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: These products are disproportionately consumed by individuals in most deprived socioeconomic
  groups'
- 'Step 3: Price increases create larger proportional reduction in consumption among heavy drinkers in
  deprived areas'
- 'Step 4: Greater health benefit accrues to those at highest baseline risk of alcohol-related harm'
- 'Step 5: Differential benefit narrows the gap in alcohol-related health outcomes between socioeconomic
  groups'

description: MUP has potential to reduce health inequalities by disproportionately benefiting the most
  deprived populations who experience highest alcohol-related harm. The policy targets heavy consumers
  of cheap alcohol who are overrepresented in disadvantaged groups, creating a progressive public health
  impact.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly addresses how structural policy can reduce health inequities.
    Rather than individual-level interventions that may widen disparities (requiring resources or motivation),
    MUP works through environmental modification that automatically provides greater protection to those
    at highest risk. This represents structural competency by addressing the commercial determinants that
    create and maintain health inequalities related to alcohol.
