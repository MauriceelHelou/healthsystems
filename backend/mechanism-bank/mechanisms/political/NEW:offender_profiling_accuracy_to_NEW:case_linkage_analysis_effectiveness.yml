description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 426 publications examines offender profiling
  effectiveness over 40 years. While noting considerable improvements in scientific rigor, the review
  finds that few studies used strong empirical approaches and even fewer evaluations of effectiveness
  have been conducted. Case linkage analysis demonstrates moderate to strong accuracy for linking crimes
  to single offenders. This has indirect relevance to health equity through potential impacts on community
  safety, trauma exposure from violent crime, and equitable application of law enforcement techniques.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This paper primarily addresses criminal justice methodology rather than direct
    health determinants. However, the structural implications include: (1) Potential for racial/ethnic
    bias in profiling methodologies if not empirically validated across populations; (2) Uneven access
    to sophisticated profiling techniques across jurisdictions may create inequitable crime resolution
    rates; (3) The finding that few effectiveness evaluations exist raises concerns about evidence-based
    practice in systems that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The review does not directly
    address health outcomes but relates to structural determinants through criminal justice system quality
    and community safety.'
