mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural cissexism creates institutional barriers to healthcare, employment,
  housing, and legal protections for gender minority people'
- 'Step 2: Systemic exclusion and marginalization generate chronic minority stress
  specific to gender identity oppression'
- 'Step 3: Gender minority stress compounds with other forms of oppression, creating
  unique stressors not captured by heterosexism alone'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol use serves as coping mechanism for managing cissexism-based minority
  stress, contributing to elevated alcohol use inequities'
