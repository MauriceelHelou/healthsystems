direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP establishes minimum price per unit of alcohol sold'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices reduce purchasing power for alcohol, particularly cheap high-strength products'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol purchasing leads to decreased consumption at population level'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption reduces acute alcohol-related harms (injuries, poisoning) and chronic disease
  progression'
- 'Step 5: Reduced exposure decreases overall alcohol-related morbidity burden'

description: Evidence meeting Bradford Hill criteria supports that minimum unit pricing reduces alcohol-related
  morbidity through the price-consumption-harm pathway. Both acute harms (injuries, poisoning) and chronic
  conditions are affected.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Variable quality of evidence noted; large proportion of evidence base produced by small
    number of research teams
moderators:
- name: drinking_pattern

  strength: moderate
  description: Heavy and harmful drinkers who consume larger quantities of cheap alcohol show greater
    morbidity reductions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: MUP represents a structural policy intervention targeting the commercial environment
    rather than individual counseling or treatment approaches. This addresses upstream determinants of
    alcohol harm while avoiding stigmatization of individuals with alcohol use disorders.
