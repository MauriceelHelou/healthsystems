description: Increased alcohol taxation reduces alcohol consumption through price mechanisms while generating
  government revenue that can be reinvested in the economy, producing both health benefits and economic
  stimulation simultaneously

  variation_notes: Study focused specifically on UK economy and health system context; findings may vary
    by country due to different tax structures, healthcare systems, and drinking cultures

  description: The use of increased tax revenues to stimulate government expenditure strengthens the positive
    economic effects, creating a 'double dividend' rather than economic trade-off
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism operates at the population level through fiscal policy rather than
    targeting individual behavior change. It addresses the structural availability and affordability of
    alcohol as a root cause of excessive consumption. The policy approach recognizes that individual choices
    are shaped by price signals and market conditions created by government policy.
