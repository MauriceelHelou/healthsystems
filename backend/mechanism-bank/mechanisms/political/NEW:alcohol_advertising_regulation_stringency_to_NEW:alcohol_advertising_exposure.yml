direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Comprehensive advertising bans reduce overall volume of alcohol marketing across all media
  channels'
- 'Step 2: Reduced marketing volume decreases population-level exposure to alcohol-promoting messages'
- 'Step 3: Unlike partial bans, comprehensive bans prevent promotional budget shifting to unregulated
  channels'
- 'Step 4: New regulatory approaches including AI monitoring and transparency requirements enhance enforcement
  capability'

description: Regulatory stringency directly affects alcohol advertising exposure, with comprehensive bans
  being most effective. The paper notes that partial bans and placement restrictions have limited utility
  for digital media due to its individualized and targeted nature, and content restrictions only address
  how alcohol is represented rather than marketing volume.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Regulatory stringency and approaches vary substantially across international jurisdictions;
    some have applied traditional strategies to digital media while others have developed novel regulatory
    approaches

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers policy and regulatory structures as determinants of health-relevant
    exposures. The paper emphasizes structural barriers to effective regulation including the mismatch
    between traditional regulatory frameworks and digital media characteristics. This avoids individual
    blame by recognizing that exposure is determined by policy environments rather than personal media
    choices.
