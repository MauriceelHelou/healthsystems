description: The systematic review concludes that future policies aimed at regulating alcohol marketing
  to a greater extent may have important short- and long-term public health implications for reducing
  underage or problematic alcohol use among youth. This implies that current regulatory weakness permits
  marketing exposure that drives youth drinking.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Regulatory environments vary across the multiple countries included in the systematic
    review
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies the policy environment as a structural determinant of
    alcohol marketing exposure. Rather than focusing on individual susceptibility to advertising, it traces
    the problem to regulatory gaps that permit industry marketing practices targeting youth. This framing
    supports policy advocacy for stronger marketing restrictions as a population-level intervention.
