mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice system maintains philosophical alignment with abstinence-based treatment models'
- 'Step 2: Referral networks and partnerships are established primarily with abstinence-oriented programs'
- 'Step 3: Drug court and probation requirements often prohibit or discourage medication use'
- 'Step 4: Treatment programs receiving justice system referrals adapt to meet these requirements'
- 'Step 5: Evidence-based medication treatment becomes systematically unavailable to justice-involved
  populations'

description: The criminal justice system's referral pathways to substance use treatment are structurally
  oriented toward abstinence-based programs rather than evidence-based medication treatment. This institutional
  arrangement creates a systematic barrier to effective OUD treatment for the estimated half of Americans
  with opioid use disorder who have had prior criminal justice contact.

  description: State-level policies regarding medication treatment in correctional settings vary substantially
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how institutional ideologies embedded in the criminal
    justice system translate into concrete health disparities. The preference for abstinence-based treatment
    reflects moral rather than scientific frameworks for understanding addiction. Improving access requires
    policy-level changes to criminal justice referral practices and integration with public health approaches,
    not changes in individual patient behavior.
