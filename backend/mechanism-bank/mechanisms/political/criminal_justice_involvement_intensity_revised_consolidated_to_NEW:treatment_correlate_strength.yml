direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice supervision imposes external treatment mandates that override individual-level
  correlates'
- 'Step 2: Traditional sociodemographic and behavioral factors that predict treatment-seeking become less
  predictive'
- 'Step 3: All correlates showed either weaker relationships or no relationship to treatment receipt for
  supervised population'
- 'Step 4: This suggests criminal justice system creates a distinct treatment access pathway disconnected
  from typical healthcare utilization patterns'

description: Among those on probation and parole, traditional sociodemographic, behavioral, and mental
  health correlates of treatment receipt showed weaker or absent relationships compared to the general
  population, suggesting criminal justice involvement restructures treatment access pathways.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how criminal justice institutions mediate healthcare access
    in ways that differ from voluntary treatment-seeking. The weakening of typical correlates suggests
    that structural/legal factors override individual-level determinants, highlighting how policy structures
    health service utilization independent of clinical or demographic factors.
