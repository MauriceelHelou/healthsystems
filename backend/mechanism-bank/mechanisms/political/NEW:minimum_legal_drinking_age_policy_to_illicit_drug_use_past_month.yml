description: MLDA policy changes show no significant effect on use of other substances, suggesting alcohol-specific
  policy interventions do not produce substitution effects toward other drugs among adolescents.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Null finding consistent across Spanish regions examined
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This null finding is important for policy design - it suggests MLDA increases do
    not create unintended displacement to other substance use, supporting the targeted effectiveness of
    alcohol-specific structural interventions without creating new harms.
