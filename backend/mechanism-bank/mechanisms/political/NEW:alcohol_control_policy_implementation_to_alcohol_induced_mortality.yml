mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Evidence-based alcohol policies (advertising restrictions, warning labels, pricing) reduce
  population exposure to alcohol marketing and increase cost barriers'
- 'Step 2: Reduced marketing exposure and increased prices decrease population-level consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower per capita consumption reduces prevalence of alcohol use disorder and hazardous drinking'
- 'Step 4: Reduced hazardous drinking decreases alcohol-attributable mortality from liver disease, cardiovascular
  disease, and injuries'

description: The study documents broad public support (>50%) for evidence-based alcohol policies in Ireland,
  in context where alcohol use is described as a leading risk factor for death and disability. This support
  provides enabling conditions for structural policy interventions to reduce alcohol-attributable mortality.

  variation_notes: Ireland context with >50% support for evidence-based policies; implementation and effectiveness
    may vary by national policy context
moderators:
- name: gender
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Women more likely to support policies, potentially reflecting gendered experiences of alcohol-related
    harms
- name: sociodemographic_characteristics
  direction: strengthens
  strength: weak
  description: Notable differences in support according to sociodemographic characteristics suggest equity
    implications for policy implementation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers structural policy interventions rather than individual behavior
    change as the pathway to reduced alcohol mortality. The framing acknowledges that 'excess alcohol
    consumption and related harms' are produced by policy environments that can be modified through collective
    action, not individual willpower.
