mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Canadian healthcare operates through a complex federal-provincial relationship'
- 'Step 2: Lack of national institutional cohesion creates inconsistent mental health service availability
  across provinces'
- 'Step 3: Absence of policies specifically addressing emerging adult mental healthcare needs'
- 'Step 4: Emerging adults fall into service gaps between pediatric and adult mental health systems'
- 'Step 5: Fragmented system creates barriers to consistent, accessible mental healthcare'

  policies create systemic barriers to adequate mental healthcare access

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This is a purely structural and political mechanism reflecting governance failures
    rather than individual deficits. Solutions require federal-provincial coordination and policy development
    specifically targeting the 18-25 age demographic. The authors suggest Canada could develop a model
    for other nations if these structural barriers are addressed.
