description: This study examined trends in DUI arrests in the United States from 1995-2013 using FBI Uniform
  Crime Reporting data. DUI arrests accounted for 10% of total arrests (14,107,840 individuals). Results
  showed a 9% decrease in DUI arrests over this period with an average yearly rate change of 1%, though
  this trend was not statistically significant (Z=-1.77, p=0.076). The study emphasizes the importance
  of monitoring alcohol-impaired driving trends to evaluate prevention effectiveness.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately focuses on structural factors (law enforcement policies,
    surveillance systems, prevention measures) rather than individual blame. The study acknowledges that
    existing data sources should be utilized efficiently for policy planning. The structural approach
    recognizes that DUI is a public health issue requiring systematic monitoring and policy intervention
    rather than solely individual-level interventions. However, the study does not address equity implications
    or differential enforcement patterns by race, class, or geography, which is a limitation from a structural
    competency perspective.
