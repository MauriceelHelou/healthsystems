mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of complete ban on alcohol advertising eliminates commercial promotion of alcohol
  products'
- 'Step 2: Reduced exposure to alcohol marketing decreases social normalization of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower marketing exposure reduces consumer demand and purchase intentions for alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Decreased demand translates to immediate and sustained reduction in recorded alcohol sales'

description: A complete ban on alcohol advertising in Norway in 1975 was associated with an immediate
  and lasting 7.4% reduction in recorded alcohol sales. This policy-level intervention demonstrates how
  restricting commercial promotion of alcohol can reduce population-level consumption through decreased
  exposure to marketing that normalizes and promotes drinking behavior.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention at the policy level - rather
    than targeting individual drinking behaviors, it addresses the commercial determinants of health by
    restricting industry marketing practices. The advertising ban removes environmental cues that normalize
    alcohol consumption and create demand, demonstrating how regulatory policy can shape health behaviors
    without placing blame on individuals. Equity implications include potential differential effects across
    socioeconomic groups who may have varying exposure to alternative marketing channels (e.g., satellite
    TV, social media) that could circumvent the ban. The policy represents a population-level approach
    that affects the entire commercial environment rather than requiring individual behavior change.
