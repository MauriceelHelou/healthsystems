mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: General population alcohol policies reduce overall alcohol availability'
- 'Step 2: Reduced population-level exposure to alcohol marketing, access, and normalization'
- 'Step 3: Lower per capita alcohol consumption across all demographic groups'
- 'Step 4: Pregnant individuals experience same protective environment as general population'
- 'Step 5: Reduced development of or escalation of alcohol use disorders during pregnancy'

description: The study demonstrates that general population alcohol policies are relevant for pregnant
  people's treatment utilization, challenging the assumption that pregnancy-specific policies are necessary
  or optimal. This supports a universal policy approach that avoids singling out pregnant individuals
  while still achieving protective effects.

  description: Abstract notes pregnancy-specific alcohol policies have limited effectiveness and established
    risks, suggesting general population approaches may be more beneficial
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding is highly relevant for structural competency as it suggests that universal
    policies may be more effective and less stigmatizing than targeted interventions. Pregnancy-specific
    policies carry risks of deterring prenatal care, criminalizing pregnant individuals, and perpetuating
    surveillance of reproductive bodies. General population policies address root causes of alcohol availability
    without these equity concerns.
