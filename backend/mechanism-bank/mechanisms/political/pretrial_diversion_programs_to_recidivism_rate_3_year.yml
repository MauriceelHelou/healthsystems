mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Police-initiated diversion programs route low-risk youth away from formal court processing
  toward alternative interventions'
- 'Step 2: Reduced penetration into criminal justice system limits exposure to potentially criminogenic
  environments and peer influences within the system'
- 'Step 3: Avoidance of formal processing prevents labeling effects and stigmatization associated with
  official delinquency records'
- 'Step 4: Alternative interventions may address underlying psychosocial needs without the negative consequences
  of system involvement'
- 'Step 5: Reduced future delinquent behavior results from avoiding the harmful effects of deeper justice
  system engagement'

description: Police-led diversion of low-risk youth reduces future delinquent behavior compared to traditional
  system processing. Assuming a 50% reoffending rate for traditional processing, diverted youth show approximately
  44% reoffending rate - a 6 percentage point reduction. This effect held across 13 RCTs judged free from
  obvious risks of bias.

  strength: weak
  description: No meaningful differences were found across types of diversionary programs, suggesting
    the effect is robust regardless of specific diversion approach
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how criminal justice system structure itself can be criminogenic
    - traditional processing may increase rather than decrease future delinquency through labeling, stigmatization,
    and exposure to negative peer influences. The intervention operates at the system level rather than
    blaming individual youth for their behavior. Policy implications focus on changing police and justice
    system responses rather than individual-level interventions. Equity implications are significant as
    youth of color are disproportionately processed through traditional justice channels, meaning they
    may disproportionately experience the harmful effects of formal processing that diversion programs
    can prevent.
