description: The review identifies that conditional approval schemes in multiple jurisdictions require
  manufacturers to generate additional evidence after initial market access. This creates a policy mechanism
  whereby devices with promising but incomplete evidence can reach patients while building a stronger
  evidence base over time.

  description: Strength of regulatory enforcement of post-market study commitments affects quality of
    evidence generated
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to policy-level decisions about how to balance innovation
    access with evidence requirements. It represents a structural approach to managing uncertainty in
    medical device safety rather than placing burden on individual patients or providers to evaluate incomplete
    evidence.
