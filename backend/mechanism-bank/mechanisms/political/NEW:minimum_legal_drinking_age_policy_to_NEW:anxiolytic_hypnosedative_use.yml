description: Raising the minimum legal drinking age leads to a 10% decrease in the use of anxiolytics
  and hypnosedatives among adolescents, suggesting improved mental health outcomes through reduced alcohol-induced
  anxiety.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects observed across Spanish regions with staggered MLDA implementation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that alcohol policy affects mental health care utilization,
    suggesting MLDA policies have health system implications beyond direct alcohol harms. Structural interventions
    can reduce pharmaceutical dependence for anxiety management in youth populations.
