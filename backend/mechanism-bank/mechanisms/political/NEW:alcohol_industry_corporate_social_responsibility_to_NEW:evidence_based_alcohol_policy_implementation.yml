mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry engages in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities including philanthropy
  and ''responsible drinking'' education programs'
- 'Step 2: CSR activities cultivate positive industry reputation and create perception of corporate citizenship'
- 'Step 3: Industry influence on policymakers increases through relationship-building and narrative control'
- 'Step 4: Implementation of evidence-based policies (higher taxes, stricter advertising laws, mandatory
  warning labels) is obstructed or delayed'
- 'Step 5: Population-level alcohol harm prevention efforts are undermined'

description: The alcohol industry in Portugal uses corporate social responsibility activities (with philanthropy
  and alcohol education comprising 65% of CSR practices) to cultivate reputation and influence decision-making,
  which obstructs implementation of cost-effective alcohol policies including higher taxes, stricter advertising
  laws, and mandatory warning labels.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies corporate political activity as a structural determinant
    of health. Rather than focusing on individual drinking behavior, it traces alcohol-related harm to
    industry tactics that undermine population-level protective policies. The conflict between profit-driven
    objectives and public health initiatives represents a fundamental structural barrier to alcohol harm
    reduction. Policy responses should address this structural issue through monitoring, regulation, or
    prohibition of alcohol industry CSR practices.
