direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco control laws are enacted to regulate retail tobacco sales including bans on sales to
  minors, advertising restrictions, and single-stick sales prohibitions'
- 'Step 2: Limited awareness and educational outreach to vendors results in lack of knowledge about specific
  legal requirements'
- 'Step 3: Vendors who are unaware of laws cannot comply with regulations they do not know exist'
- 'Step 4: Non-compliance with retail tobacco laws maintains tobacco accessibility and undermines public
  health objectives'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies structural failures in policy implementation rather than
    blaming individual vendors. The gap between law enactment and vendor awareness represents a systemic
    failure in regulatory communication and enforcement infrastructure. Addressing this requires government
    investment in educational outreach and enforcement capacity.
