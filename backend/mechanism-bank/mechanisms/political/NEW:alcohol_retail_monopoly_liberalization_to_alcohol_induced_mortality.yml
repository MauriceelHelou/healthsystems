description: The Finnish alcohol retail monopoly was liberalized during the study period (2014-2017),
  contrasting with the gambling monopoly which was strengthened. This comparative analysis suggests that
  the structural arrangements and stakeholder configurations around alcohol policy were insufficient to
  resist liberalization pressures that the gambling sector successfully resisted.

  equity_implications: This mechanism traces alcohol availability to policy structures rather than individual
    consumption choices. The comparative analysis reveals how different political-economic conditions
    produce different regulatory outcomes across sectors, highlighting structural determinants of alcohol
    availability. The equity implications relate to how liberalization may disproportionately affect vulnerable
    populations through increased availability.
