category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP establishes floor prices that disproportionately increase costs of
  cheapest alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Low-income consumers have higher likelihood of purchasing low-cost, high-strength
  alcohol targeted by MUP'
- 'Step 3: Price increases affect larger proportion of purchases made by low-income
  consumers'
- 'Step 4: Greater exposure to price changes combined with budget constraints produces
  larger consumption reductions in low-income groups'
