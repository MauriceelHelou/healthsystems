direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory calorie labeling implemented on menus, products, and packaging'
- 'Step 2: Population-level exposure to calorie information at point of food selection'
- 'Step 3: Small but consistent reductions in energy selected (~11 kcal/meal) and consumed (~35 kcal/meal)'
- 'Step 4: Sustained caloric deficit accumulates over time when policy applied at scale'
- 'Step 5: Population-level reduction in obesity prevalence through reduced chronic energy surplus'

description: Calorie labeling policies represent a structural intervention that may contribute to obesity
  prevention at the population level. While individual meal-level effects are small (1.8-5.9% reduction
  in energy), sustained exposure across a population eating out frequently could produce meaningful cumulative
  effects on energy balance and obesity prevention.

  variation_notes: Implementation varies across jurisdictions; most studies from USA and UK where labeling
    policies have been implemented or are being expanded.

  description: Authors emphasize effects are 'potentially meaningful impacts on population health when
    applied at scale' - broader policy implementation strengthens population-level impact.

  description: Authors identify SES as a priority moderator requiring further research; differential effects
    could have equity implications.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism exemplifies a structural approach to obesity prevention that modifies
    the food environment rather than targeting individual behavior change. The policy places the burden
    on food providers rather than consumers. However, equity implications require attention: if effects
    differ by SES, the policy could inadvertently widen health disparities. The review notes most evidence
    comes from high-SES populations, creating uncertainty about effects in communities experiencing greater
    obesity burden. Additionally, the authors note potential systemic impacts on industry actions (reformulation,
    portion sizing) that could amplify health benefits beyond individual selection effects.'
