- 'Step 1: Implementation of alcohol marketing restrictions reduces advertising exposure'
- 'Step 2: Decreased marketing exposure theoretically reduces initiation and heavy drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Lower population consumption expected to reduce progression to alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: However, empirical evidence does not support this pathway''s effectiveness'

description: The theoretical pathway from marketing bans to reduced alcohol use disorder operates through
  reduced consumption. However, this systematic review found insufficient evidence that marketing bans
  reduce consumption, thereby undermining the expected downstream effect on alcohol use disorder prevalence.
  The review challenges the WHO designation of marketing bans as a 'best buy' policy intervention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This represents an attempt to address commercial determinants of health through
    policy intervention. The lack of supporting evidence does not invalidate the structural approach but
    suggests implementation complexity or measurement challenges. Marketing ban policies represent a non-stigmatizing,
    non-individual-blaming approach to alcohol harm reduction that targets industry practices rather than
    consumer behavior. Future research needs to address methodological limitations to better evaluate
    this structural intervention's true effectiveness.
