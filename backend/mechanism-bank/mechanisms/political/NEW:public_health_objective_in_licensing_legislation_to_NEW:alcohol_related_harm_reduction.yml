description: Despite Scotland's innovative inclusion of public health objectives in alcohol licensing
  legislation, the persistence of alcohol-related harms and inequalities indicates that legislative intent
  is not translating effectively into licensing practice.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how progressive policy intentions can be undermined by
    implementation failures at the structural level. The issue is not public knowledge or individual drinking
    behavior but the institutional systems that translate policy into practice. Health inequities persist
    when governance structures fail to operationalize public health goals.
