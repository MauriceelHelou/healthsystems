direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Proactive pre-market testing and quality assurance requirements are relaxed'
- 'Step 2: Accountability shifts to industry self-reporting and consumer complaint systems'
- 'Step 3: Hazardous products remain in circulation until problems are identified and reported'
- 'Step 4: Health Canada advisories and recalls occur after consumer exposure has already happened'
- 'Step 5: Time lag between product distribution and recall increases population exposure to hazards'

description: The shift from proactive quality assurance to reactive monitoring (industry self-reporting,
  consumer complaints, post-market advisories) during the pandemic created delays in identifying and removing
  hazardous hand sanitizer products from the market.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how regulatory enforcement infrastructure determines
    population health protection. The decision to shift accountability mechanisms was a structural policy
    choice that prioritized product availability over safety assurance. Communities with less access to
    recall information or those dependent on products obtained through informal channels face disproportionate
    continued exposure.
