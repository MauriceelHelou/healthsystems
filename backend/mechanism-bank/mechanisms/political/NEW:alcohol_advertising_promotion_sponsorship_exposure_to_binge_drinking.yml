direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transnational alcohol corporations (TACs) expand operations in Southeast Asia through new breweries,
  acquisitions, and joint ventures'
- 'Step 2: Weak or nonexistent alcohol advertising, promotion, and sponsorship (AAPS) regulations allow
  aggressive marketing'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure to alcohol marketing normalizes drinking behaviors and creates positive
  associations with alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Marketing exposure particularly influences youth and young adults, leading to earlier initiation
  and increased consumption patterns'
- 'Step 5: Population-level alcohol consumption increases, including binge drinking behaviors'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies corporate expansion and regulatory policy weakness as
    structural determinants of alcohol consumption. The focus is on commercial and political factors rather
    than individual choice, highlighting how corporate interests and policy gaps create environments that
    promote harmful drinking. Equity implications include differential vulnerability in countries with
    weaker regulatory infrastructure and less capacity to resist commercial pressures from TACs.
