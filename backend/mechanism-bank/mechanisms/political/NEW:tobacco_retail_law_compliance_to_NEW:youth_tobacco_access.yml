- 'Step 2: Vendors demonstrated positive perceptions about bans on sales to and by minors, indicating

  description: Most participants had positive perceptions about the ban on sales to and by minors, suggesting
    that when vendors view laws favorably, compliance potential increases
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Youth tobacco access is structurally determined by the effectiveness of retail
    regulation enforcement. Positive vendor perceptions toward youth sales bans represent an opportunity
    for targeted intervention that could reduce youth tobacco initiation.
