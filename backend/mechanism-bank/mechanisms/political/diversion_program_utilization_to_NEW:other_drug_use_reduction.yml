mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Diversion programs provide court-mandated or voluntary treatment pathways for drug-using offenders'
- 'Step 2: Treatment programs address polysubstance use patterns common among class A drug users'
- 'Step 3: Sustained treatment engagement enables behavioral changes across multiple substances'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in use of drugs beyond the primary substance of concern'

description: Diversion programs show larger effect on reducing use of drugs other than the primary substance
  (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.70-3.98). This suggests treatment accessed through diversion may have broader impacts
  on polysubstance use patterns, though evidence quality limitations persist.

  description: High attrition, retrospective data, limited follow-up periods, and publication bias reduce
    confidence in estimates
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding emphasizes that structural alternatives to incarceration can produce
    health benefits extending beyond the targeted condition. The criminal justice system serves as a touchpoint
    for connecting individuals with substance use disorders to treatment that might otherwise be inaccessible
    due to economic, geographic, or social barriers.
