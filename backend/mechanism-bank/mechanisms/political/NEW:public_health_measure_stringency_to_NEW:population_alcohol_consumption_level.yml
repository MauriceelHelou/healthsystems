mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government imposes stringent COVID-19 restrictions including travel limitations, social activity
  restrictions, and economic shutdowns'
- 'Step 2: Governments simultaneously expand home delivery options and extend trading hours for liquor
  stores'
- 'Step 3: Population experiences increased stress, isolation, and disrupted routines due to restrictions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced bar/restaurant sales partially offset by increased private liquor store sales'
- 'Step 5: Overall per capita alcohol consumption increases by 7.10% during pandemic versus previous years'

description: Stringency of COVID-19 public health measures was positively associated with population-level
  alcohol consumption, with overall consumption increasing 7.10% during the pandemic compared to previous
  years. This reflects a paradoxical effect where restrictions intended to reduce viral transmission may
  have increased alcohol-related harms.

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates the unintended consequences of public health policy
    and the need for policy coherence. While COVID-19 restrictions were implemented to protect health,
    concurrent decisions to expand alcohol availability (home delivery, extended hours) may have undermined
    public health goals. The structural framing focuses on policy decisions rather than individual coping
    behaviors, highlighting how government alcohol monopoly systems can either promote or harm population
    health depending on policy choices.
