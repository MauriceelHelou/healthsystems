mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State enacts policies that criminalize or penalize alcohol use during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Policies create fear of disclosure and legal consequences among pregnant women'
- 'Step 3: Women delay or avoid prenatal care to evade detection and potential punishment'
- 'Step 4: Decreased early prenatal care utilization, particularly first trimester care initiation'

description: Alcohol/pregnancy policies decrease prenatal care utilization, with adverse effects concentrated
  among women with higher education levels, while potentially improving care access for women with less
  education.

  description: For prenatal care, patterns were generally similar to birth outcomes - adverse effects
    concentrated among women with more education and beneficial effects among women with less education.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how policies intended to promote fetal health can create
    structural barriers to healthcare access. The policy-induced fear of legal consequences acts as a
    deterrent to seeking care, demonstrating unintended consequences of punitive approaches to public
    health. The differential impact by education suggests complex interactions between social position
    and policy effects.
