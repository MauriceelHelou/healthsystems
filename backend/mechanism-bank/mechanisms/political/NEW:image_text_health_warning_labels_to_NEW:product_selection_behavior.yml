mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pictorial warnings combine visual imagery with text to communicate health risks'
- 'Step 2: Images bypass literacy requirements and engage emotional processing pathways'
- 'Step 3: Visual depictions of health consequences (e.g., diseased organs) create stronger negative affect'
- 'Step 4: Combined cognitive and emotional response produces greater deterrence than text alone'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced deterrence effect translates to larger reductions in product selection'

description: Image-and-text health warning labels showed a 35% reduction in product selection (RR=0.65)
  compared to 21% reduction for text-only labels (RR=0.79). While the difference was not statistically
  significant, the pattern suggests pictorial warnings may have enhanced effectiveness.

  equity_implications: Pictorial warnings are particularly important from a health equity perspective
    as they can communicate risk information to populations with lower literacy, non-native language speakers,
    and those who may not read warning text. This design consideration addresses structural inequities
    in health information access and could reduce disparities in preventable disease burden among marginalized
    populations who face disproportionate exposure to alcohol and unhealthy food marketing.
