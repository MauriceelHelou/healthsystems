direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State implements policies defining alcohol use during pregnancy as child abuse/neglect or allowing
  civil commitment'
- 'Step 2: Policies create surveillance and punitive environment for pregnant women'
- 'Step 3: Pregnant women avoid or delay seeking prenatal care due to fear of legal consequences'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate prenatal care leads to undetected maternal health issues and nutritional deficiencies'
- 'Step 5: Increased rates of low birthweight infants due to lack of appropriate prenatal intervention'

description: Punitive alcohol/pregnancy policies are associated with increased low birthweight rates,
  particularly among women with higher educational attainment, while showing potential protective effects
  for women with less than high school education.

  variation_notes: State-level variation in policy implementation creates geographic disparities in birth
    outcomes.

  description: Five policies showed adverse effects on low birthweight for high school graduates. Six
    policies had adverse effects for women with more than high school education. Two policies had beneficial
    effects on low birthweight for women with less than high school education.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The paradoxical finding that policies harm higher-educated women more than lower-educated
    women challenges assumptions about who benefits from public health policies. This may reflect differential
    targeting, surveillance, or help-seeking behavior across socioeconomic strata, demonstrating how policy
    effects are mediated by social position.
