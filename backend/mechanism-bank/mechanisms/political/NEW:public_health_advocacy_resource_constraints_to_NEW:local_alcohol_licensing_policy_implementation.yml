- 'Step 2: Data gaps limit ability to make evidence-based arguments at local level'

- 'Step 4: Reduced effectiveness of public health input into licensing decisions'
- 'Step 5: Weaker implementation of public health objectives in local alcohol policy'

description: Public health actors face resource constraints, data gaps, and unfamiliar processes when
  attempting to influence local alcohol licensing decisions. These structural barriers reduce the effectiveness
  of public health advocacy, limiting the translation of national health objectives into local policy.
  Interviewees adapted their strategies to these challenges but noted the need for better understanding
  of policy change processes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural resource inequities between public health
    advocates and commercial interests affect policy outcomes. The systematic underfunding of public health
    advocacy capacity creates asymmetric influence in licensing processes. This structural analysis avoids
    blaming individual public health workers for policy failures and instead points to systemic resource
    allocation issues.
