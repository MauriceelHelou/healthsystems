- 'Step 1: Youth complete juvenile drug treatment court program (average graduation rate 54.74%)'
- 'Step 2: Program completion ends structured supervision, treatment services, and judicial oversight'
- 'Step 3: Without sustained community support and continued treatment, treatment gains may not be maintained'
- 'Step 4: Implementation failures in connecting youth to post-program services limit long-term effectiveness'
- 'Step 5: Postprogram recidivism rates show minimal to no difference from traditional adjudication'

description: Due partly to implementation failures, JDTCs may have minimal to no effects on postprogram
  recidivism. While during-supervision effects are modest, the lack of sustained impact after program
  completion highlights structural gaps in transitioning youth to community-based supports.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of sustained effects reveals structural limitations in the juvenile justice
    system's ability to address root causes of youth substance use and offending. Implementation failures
    reflect systemic issues including underfunding, inadequate training, and fragmented service systems
    rather than individual youth failure. This finding points to the need for structural solutions that
    extend beyond court supervision periods.
