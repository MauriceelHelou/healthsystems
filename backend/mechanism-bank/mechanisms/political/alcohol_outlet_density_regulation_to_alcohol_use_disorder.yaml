mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol outlet density regulations (population-based restrictions, distance-based
  restrictions, quotas) reduce the number and density of alcohol retail outlets in
  communities'
- 'Step 2: Reduced outlet density decreases physical and economic accessibility to
  alcohol, creating structural barriers that limit alcohol availability and purchasing
  opportunities'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol availability reduces excessive alcohol consumption patterns
  and environmental triggers for relapse, thereby decreasing the incidence and severity
  of alcohol use disorder'

description: Alcohol outlet density regulation operates through environmental policy
  mechanisms that create structural barriers to alcohol access. Research demonstrates
  that higher outlet density is associated with increased alcohol problems and relapse
  risk, while regulatory restrictions that limit outlet numbers and density can reduce
  alcohol availability and associated harms. The mechanism operates at the community
  level by modifying the drinking environment itself, making alcohol less physically
  and economically accessible, which in turn reduces opportunities for excessive consumption
  and environmental triggers that contribute to alcohol use disorder development and
  maintenance.
structural_competency_notes: This mechanism represents a structural intervention that
  addresses alcohol use disorder at the population level rather than individual level.
  Regulatory policies create differential impacts across communities, with potential
  benefits particularly pronounced for high-risk populations including those with
  genetic predispositions and individuals in recovery. The effectiveness depends on
  implementation consistency and community context, highlighting how policy-level
  interventions can modify environmental determinants of health.
