direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased drink-driving enforcement operations (sobriety checkpoints, random breath testing)
  raise the perceived risk of detection'
- 'Step 2: Higher visibility of enforcement activities creates general deterrence effect in the driving
  population'
- 'Step 3: Sustained enforcement reduces the prevalence of drink-driving behavior'
- 'Step 4: Reduced drink-driving leads to fewer alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes'
- 'Step 5: Decreased crash frequency results in lower crash-related fatalities'

description: This systematic review examined the relationship between drink-driving enforcement dosage
  (intensity/frequency of enforcement operations) and drink-driving outcomes including motor vehicle crashes
  and fatalities. While most of the 21 included studies found that sustained enforcement was associated
  with reductions in drink driving or related harms, the review found insufficient evidence to determine
  an optimal enforcement dosage threshold. Only two studies tested an optimal dosage level.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies differed in measures of enforcement dosage and outcomes across different jurisdictions,
    making cross-study synthesis difficult. Community settings presented challenges for rigorous study
    designs.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately focuses on policy enforcement as a structural intervention
    rather than individual behavior change. The review highlights structural barriers including resource
    constraints faced by law enforcement agencies, which disproportionately affect communities with fewer
    resources. The framing appropriately positions enforcement capacity as a policy choice that affects
    population-level outcomes. However, enforcement-based approaches may have differential impacts across
    communities, potentially affecting marginalized populations through increased police contact while
    not addressing underlying social determinants of alcohol misuse.
