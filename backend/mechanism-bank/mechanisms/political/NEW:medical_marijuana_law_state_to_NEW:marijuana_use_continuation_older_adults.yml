direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: States enact medical marijuana laws, creating legal framework for cannabis access'
- 'Step 2: Legal access reduces barriers and stigma associated with marijuana use for older adults'
- 'Step 3: Older adults who use marijuana are less likely to transition to nonuse due to continued legal
  access'
- 'Step 4: Policy environment supports sustained use patterns rather than cessation'

description: Residence in states with medical marijuana laws was associated with a lower likelihood of
  use-to-nonuse compared to continued use among older adults, suggesting that policy environments permitting
  medical marijuana access support sustained marijuana use patterns.
spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: Effect observed specifically in states with medical marijuana laws versus states without
    such laws

  description: Effects may differ between 50-64 age group (7.2% continued users) and 65+ age group (2.4%
    continued users)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately traces marijuana use patterns to state-level policy
    decisions rather than individual choices. The structural determinant (state marijuana policy) shapes
    the context in which older adults make decisions about substance use. Equity implications include
    differential access based on state of residence.
