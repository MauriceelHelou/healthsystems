description: Mental Health Courts reduce incarceration by diverting individuals with mental illness from
  jail/prison into community-based treatment. The abstract explicitly states MHCs were 'created to divert
  offenders with mental illness away from incarceration.' The 42.46% reduction in recidivism further compounds
  this effect by reducing future incarcerations.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural problem of mass incarceration of individuals
    with mental illness. Jails and prisons have become de facto psychiatric facilities due to deinstitutionalization
    without adequate community mental health infrastructure. MHCs represent a structural reform that acknowledges
    incarceration is an inappropriate and harmful response to mental illness. This has significant equity
    implications as communities of color are disproportionately affected by both mass incarceration and
    mental health treatment gaps. The mechanism shifts from a punitive to a therapeutic model at the system
    level.
