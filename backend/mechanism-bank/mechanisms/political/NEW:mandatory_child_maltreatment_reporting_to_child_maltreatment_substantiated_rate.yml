mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory reporting laws require designated professionals to report suspected child maltreatment'
- 'Step 2: Increased reporting leads to more investigations by child protective services'
- 'Step 3: Greater surveillance and investigation capacity identifies previously undetected cases'
- 'Step 4: More cases meet substantiation criteria due to increased detection rather than increased incidence'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of substantiated child maltreatment in administrative data'

description: Mandatory reporting of child maltreatment increased substantiated cases by 15.3%. This reflects
  improved detection rather than increased actual maltreatment, serving as an important control variable
  when assessing true alcohol policy effects on child harm.

    Australia
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how policy affects measurement and detection rather
    than underlying incidence. The increase represents bringing hidden harm into view through systemic
    surveillance. From an equity perspective, mandatory reporting may differentially affect marginalized
    communities who have more contact with reporting professionals, potentially leading to over-surveillance
    of certain populations while under-detecting maltreatment in others.
