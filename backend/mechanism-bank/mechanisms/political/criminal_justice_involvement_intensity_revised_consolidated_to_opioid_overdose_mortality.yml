mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experience incarceration leading to physiological tolerance reduction'
- 'Step 2: Release from incarceration creates period of heightened vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Barriers to MOUD within criminal justice system reduce treatment access'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or undertreated OUD during post-release period'
- 'Step 5: Elevated risk of fatal overdose due to reduced tolerance and lack of treatment'

  the post-release period, due to reduced tolerance and structural barriers to accessing medications for

  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how mass incarceration and criminal justice system
    policies create direct pathways to mortality for people with substance use disorders. The structural
    barriers identified (stigma, poor collaboration, policy limitations on medication types) represent
    modifiable system-level factors. Equity implications are significant given racial disparities in incarceration
    rates.
