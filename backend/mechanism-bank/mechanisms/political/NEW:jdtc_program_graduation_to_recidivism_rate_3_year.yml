mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Average program graduation rate is 54.74% among JDTC participants'
- 'Step 2: Graduation indicates completion of required treatment, supervision, and behavioral benchmarks'
- 'Step 3: Program completers have engaged with full dose of intervention services'
- 'Step 4: Those who do not graduate may face traditional sanctions and lack full intervention exposure'
- 'Step 5: Graduation status may differentially predict post-program outcomes'

description: The average graduation rate among JDTC participants was 54.74% (95% CI [0.50, 0.59]). This
  indicates that nearly half of enrolled youth do not complete the program, which has implications for
  overall program effectiveness and equity in outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The ~45% non-completion rate raises equity concerns about whether program structures
    are accessible to all youth. Youth facing greater structural barriers (housing instability, family
    challenges, transportation issues, co-occurring mental health conditions) may be less likely to graduate
    regardless of motivation. Non-completion should not be viewed as individual failure but as a signal
    that program structures may not accommodate the structural realities of vulnerable youth populations.
