mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry actors (producers, retailers, trade associations) participate in government
  policy consultations'
- 'Step 2: Industry submissions systematically misuse scientific evidence (66% of submissions) and deny
  effectiveness of evidence-based strategies (91% of submissions)'
- 'Step 3: Common tactics include making unsubstantiated claims about adverse policy effects (76%) and
  promoting alternatives without evidence (71%)'
- 'Step 4: Policy makers are exposed to misleading information that creates doubt about evidence-based
  interventions'
- 'Step 5: Government adoption of effective alcohol harm reduction policies is delayed or prevented'

description: Alcohol industry actors systematically undermine evidence-based policy adoption through strategic
  misuse of scientific evidence in government consultations. Analysis of 214 industry submissions found
  91% denied effectiveness of evidence-based strategies and 66% misused scientific evidence, with unsubstantiated
  claims about adverse policy effects (76%) and promotion of evidence-free alternatives (71%) being most
  common tactics.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a critical structural barrier to population health improvement
    - corporate influence on public policy formation. The systematic nature of evidence misuse (across
    21 consultations, multiple industry actor types) represents institutional practice rather than individual
    behavior. The mechanism explains how commercial determinants of health operate through political processes
    to maintain environments conducive to alcohol-related harm. Equity implications include disproportionate
    burden of alcohol harm on disadvantaged communities who have less political power to counter industry
    influence.
