direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensing requirements restrict who can sell alcohol commercially'
- 'Step 2: Reduced retail outlet density decreases physical availability of alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Decreased availability reduces opportunities for impulse purchasing and heavy consumption'
- 'Step 4: Lower population-level consumption reduces rates of alcohol use disorder'

description: Licensing requirements for retail alcohol sales serve as a structural barrier to commercial
  alcohol availability, reducing population exposure and associated harms

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Paper notes regimes vary for retail sale between commodities and in different jurisdictions,
    with commerce in alcohol prohibited in many places at times during the last two centuries

  description: Effectiveness varies based on existing regulatory framework and enforcement capacity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on commercial determinants of health rather than individual
    choice. Licensing policies operate at the structural level to shape the commercial environment, affecting
    entire populations regardless of individual motivation. This approach avoids blaming individuals for
    alcohol problems and instead targets the commercial systems that profit from harmful consumption.
