description: The study identifies interagency collaboration as a recommended structural intervention to
  increase probation client access to OUD medications by bridging criminal justice and healthcare systems.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 26
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural-level intervention that addresses system
    fragmentation between criminal justice and healthcare. Rather than placing burden on individuals to
    navigate complex systems, interagency collaboration creates institutional bridges that facilitate
    access to care.
