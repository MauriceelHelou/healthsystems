direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative impact zones and enhanced enforcement restrict alcohol outlet proliferation'
- 'Step 2: Reduced outlet density decreases opportunities for alcohol-facilitated sexual assault'
- 'Step 3: Lower intoxication rates in public venues reduce victim vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Modified drinking environment decreases perpetrator-victim encounters in high-risk settings'
- 'Step 5: Sexual crime rates decline in intervention areas'

description: Local alcohol licensing policies showed weak evidence of an 8.4% reduction in sexual crimes
  up to 2013, though the wide credible interval spanning zero indicates substantial uncertainty. This
  suggests potential but unconfirmed benefit of alcohol environment modification for sexual violence prevention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism is important for gender equity as alcohol outlet density and availability
    are structural factors in sexual violence. Addressing the commercial alcohol environment represents
    an upstream prevention approach that modifies conditions rather than solely relying on individual-level
    interventions. The wide confidence interval highlights the need for further research on policy impacts
    on sexual violence.
