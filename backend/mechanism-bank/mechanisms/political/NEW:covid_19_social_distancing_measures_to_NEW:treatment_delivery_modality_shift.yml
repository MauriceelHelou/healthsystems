description: Social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic forced an abrupt transformation of
  mental health and substance use treatment delivery, with nearly all in-person contact being replaced
  with video conferencing in mid-March 2020. This created a natural experiment for evaluating telehealth
  effectiveness.

    policy context
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how macro-level policy responses to public health emergencies
    can reshape healthcare delivery systems. The forced transition to telehealth revealed latent capacity
    for remote treatment delivery that may have taken years to adopt under normal circumstances. This
    has implications for health system resilience and adaptability to future disruptions, as well as for
    permanent expansion of treatment access options.
