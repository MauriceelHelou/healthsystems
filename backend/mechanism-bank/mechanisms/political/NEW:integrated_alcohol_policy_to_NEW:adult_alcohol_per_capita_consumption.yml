description: Two phases of integrated alcohol policies implemented in Lithuania in 2008/2009 and 2017/2018
  were associated with average reductions in adult (15+ years) alcohol per capita consumption of almost
  1 litre (-0.88 L; 95% CI -1.43 to -0.34). Sensitivity analyses using WHO data yielded similar results.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention - policy-level changes that
    modify the environment rather than targeting individual behavior change. The study demonstrates that
    coordinated, population-based alcohol policies can achieve meaningful reductions in consumption without
    relying on individual willpower or behavior modification. The finding that integrated policies had
    effects comparable to single major policies suggests the importance of policy comprehensiveness and
    coordination. This approach addresses structural determinants of alcohol-related harm by changing
    availability, pricing, and marketing environments at the population level.
