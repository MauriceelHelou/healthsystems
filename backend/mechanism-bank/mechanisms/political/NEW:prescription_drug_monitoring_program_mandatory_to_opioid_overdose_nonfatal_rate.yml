direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory prescription drug monitoring requires prescribers to check patient medication history
  before prescribing opioids'
- 'Step 2: Real-time monitoring reduces prescriber ability to issue prescriptions to patients already
  receiving opioids from multiple sources'
- 'Step 3: Reduced opioid supply limits availability of prescription opioids for misuse or diversion'
- 'Step 4: Decreased opioid exposure reduces risk of opioid-related adverse events requiring emergency
  care'
- 'Step 5: Opioid-related ED presentation rates decline among people prescribed opioids'

description: Implementation of mandatory prescription drug monitoring in April 2020 was associated with
  a decline in opioid-related ED presentations among people prescribed opioids, reversing a pre-intervention
  increasing trend. The rate decline was not significantly different from the control group trend.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses opioid harm through regulatory policy intervention at
    the healthcare system level rather than individual behavior modification. It recognizes that prescription
    opioid availability is a structural driver of opioid-related harm and targets the prescribing environment.
    The policy avoids blame on individuals by regulating the supply side of prescription opioids.
