direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP policy implementation raises minimum price per unit of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Price increases reduce overall population alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced consumption decreases cumulative alcohol exposure and organ damage'
- 'Step 4: Lower chronic alcohol exposure reduces incidence of alcohol-related diseases (liver cirrhosis,
  cancers, cardiovascular disease)'
- 'Step 5: Decreased disease incidence leads to reduced alcohol-related mortality'

description: The systematic review found evidence satisfying Bradford Hill causality criteria that minimum
  unit pricing reduces alcohol-related mortality. The pathway operates through price-mediated reductions
  in consumption leading to decreased cumulative alcohol exposure and subsequent disease burden.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Evidence includes both modelling studies (forecasts) and observational studies from
    different jurisdictions; quantitative uncertainty in estimates noted as often poorly communicated

- name: baseline_mortality_rate
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Populations with higher baseline alcohol-related mortality may see larger absolute reductions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how pricing policy as a structural intervention can
    reduce population-level mortality without requiring individual behavior change interventions. The
    approach addresses the commercial determinants of health by modifying the market environment for alcohol
    products.
