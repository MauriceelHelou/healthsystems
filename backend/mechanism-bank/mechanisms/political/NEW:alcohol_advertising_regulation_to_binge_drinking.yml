description: Public support for alcohol advertising bans near schools and childcare facilities was 85.1%,

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural determinants by targeting the commercial environment
    rather than individual behavior. Advertising restrictions acknowledge that alcohol marketing creates
    an obesogenic environment for harmful drinking, particularly affecting youth. Policy approaches avoid
    individual blame by addressing upstream commercial determinants of health.
