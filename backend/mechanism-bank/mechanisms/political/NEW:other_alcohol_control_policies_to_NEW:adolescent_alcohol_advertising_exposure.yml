direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Comprehensive alcohol control measures (pricing, availability restrictions, drink-driving laws)
  create policy environment less favorable to alcohol industry'
- 'Step 2: Reduced overall alcohol market size may decrease industry investment in advertising'
- 'Step 3: Policy environments with strong alcohol control tend to have stronger enforcement infrastructure'
- 'Step 4: Reduced adolescent exposure to alcohol advertising through multiple policy pathways'

description: Other alcohol control measures beyond marketing-specific policies were independently and
  inversely associated with adolescent alcohol advertising exposure, suggesting that comprehensive policy
  approaches have additive protective effects.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects observed across 13 Latin American countries with varying policy environments
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This supports a comprehensive, structural approach to alcohol harm reduction rather
    than piecemeal policies. Countries with stronger overall alcohol policy environments appear to better
    protect youth from commercial marketing pressures, emphasizing the importance of policy coherence.
