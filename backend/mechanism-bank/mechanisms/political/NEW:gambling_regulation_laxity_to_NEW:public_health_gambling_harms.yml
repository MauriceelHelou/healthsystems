description: The paper concludes that given the association between gambling and public health harms,
  governments need to give greater attention to strict regulation and monitoring of gambling globally.
  This identifies inadequate gambling regulation as a structural determinant of gambling-related public
  health harms.

    and the gambling industry, appropriately identifying the structural root causes of gambling-related
    harm.
