mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systematic reviews include former drinkers in abstainer reference groups'
- 'Step 2: Former drinkers include individuals who quit due to existing illness (''sick quitters'')'
- 'Step 3: Reference group mortality artificially elevated due to pre-existing illness'
- 'Step 4: Comparison makes low-volume drinking appear protective (J-shaped curve)'
- 'Step 5: Research findings underestimate true alcohol-related mortality risk'

description: Over 70% of systematic reviews on alcohol and mortality included former drinkers in reference
  groups, creating methodological bias that makes alcohol appear protective at low doses. When this bias
  is corrected, the protective effect disappears.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This methodological finding has major structural and policy implications. Biased
    research has shaped alcohol guidelines, public health messaging, and industry marketing claims about
    'moderate drinking' benefits. The structural production of biased evidence benefits alcohol industry
    interests while obscuring true population health harms.
