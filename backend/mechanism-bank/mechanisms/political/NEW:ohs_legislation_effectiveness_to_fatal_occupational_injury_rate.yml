mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Effective OHS legislation establishes legal requirements for workplace safety standards and
  employer responsibilities'
- 'Step 2: Regulatory enforcement mechanisms ensure compliance through inspections and penalties'
- 'Step 3: Worker representation in OHS systems provides oversight and advocacy for safety improvements'
- 'Step 4: Clear and precise regulations enable evaluation and enforcement, reducing occupational hazards'
- 'Step 5: Reduced workplace hazards lead to fewer work-related deaths and diseases'

description: Occupational health and safety legislation aims to protect workers from occupational hazards,
  accidents, and disease. The effectiveness of OHS law depends on regulation formation processes, regulatory
  enforcement, inspector organization, and worker representation. Gaps in legislation effectiveness contribute
  to an estimated 2.3 million annual work-related deaths globally, primarily from work-related diseases.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The way OHS is regulated varies across nation states; evidence base dominated by Australia
    and Canada with limited representation from developing countries (only Philippines)

  description: Complex contracts, outsourcing, temporary work, and international supply chains create
    challenges for OHS regulation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately traces health outcomes to policy-level determinants
    (legislation, enforcement, regulatory systems) rather than individual worker behaviors. It highlights
    how structural factors like economic conditions and organizational restructuring create barriers to
    worker protection. The finding that developing countries are underrepresented in OHS research points
    to global health inequities in occupational safety.
