- 'Step 3: Non-punitive approach may increase engagement with health services'
- 'Step 4: No statistically significant difference in cannabis use outcomes compared to arrest'

description: Cannabis cautioning produces equivalent effects on cannabis use compared to arrest/charge
  approach, indicating that diversion to education/treatment is as effective as punitive approaches for
  substance use outcomes.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 544
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study conducted in Australia with nationwide online survey; applicability to other
    jurisdictions noted
moderators:
- name: baseline_cannabis_consumption
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Cannabis consumption levels were matched between groups; higher baseline use may reduce
    intervention effectiveness
- name: employment_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: weak
  description: Employment status was a matching variable, suggesting employed individuals may respond
    differently
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding challenges the assumption that criminal justice involvement is necessary
    to deter drug use. The null difference in substance use outcomes between cautioning and arrest suggests
    that criminalization does not provide additional public health benefit while imposing significant
    individual and social costs. This has implications for drug policy reform and reducing structural
    harms of prohibition.
