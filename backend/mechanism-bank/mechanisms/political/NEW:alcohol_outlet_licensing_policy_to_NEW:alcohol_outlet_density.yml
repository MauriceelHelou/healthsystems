mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Municipal and state licensing policies determine criteria and restrictions for alcohol outlet
  permits'
- 'Step 2: Less restrictive licensing policies allow more outlets to operate in a given area'
- 'Step 3: Absence of density caps or geographic restrictions leads to outlet clustering in certain neighborhoods'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative licensing decisions over time produce neighborhood-level variations in outlet density'

description: The study concludes with discussion of how findings can inform alcohol outlet management,
  licensing, and policy development at the community level. This implies that policy decisions about licensing
  directly shape the spatial distribution of outlets, which in turn affects violence patterns.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The paper explicitly discusses how the methods and results can help improve management,
    licensing, and policy development for alcohol outlets, acknowledging that licensing policies have
    geographic implications.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies the policy root cause of outlet density variation. Alcohol
    licensing is a governmental function that can either permit or prevent outlet concentration in vulnerable
    communities. The study's identification of 'tipping point' locations provides actionable information
    for policymakers to prevent violence through licensing decisions, representing a structural intervention
    that does not blame individuals for alcohol-related harm.
