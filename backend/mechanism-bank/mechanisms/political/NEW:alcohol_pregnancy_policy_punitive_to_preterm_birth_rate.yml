direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State enacts punitive policies regarding alcohol use during pregnancy (e.g., civil commitment,
  child abuse/neglect definitions)'
- 'Step 2: Policies create fear of legal consequences and surveillance among pregnant women'
- 'Step 3: Fear leads to avoidance of prenatal care and healthcare settings where alcohol use might be
  detected'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prenatal care utilization leads to unmanaged pregnancy complications'
- 'Step 5: Increased rates of preterm birth due to inadequate prenatal monitoring and intervention'

description: Punitive alcohol/pregnancy policies increase preterm birth rates, with effects concentrated
  among women with higher education levels (high school graduates and those with more than high school
  education), while women with less than high school education may experience protective effects from
  some policies.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects vary by state based on specific alcohol/pregnancy policy configurations. Study
    uses state-level policy data from all US states from 1972-2015.

  description: Effects vary significantly by education status. Women with high school education and those
    with more than high school education experienced adverse effects on preterm birth from 5-6 policies,
    while women with less than high school education experienced beneficial effects from some policies.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how well-intentioned policies designed to protect fetal
    health can paradoxically harm birth outcomes by creating structural barriers to care. The differential
    effects by education status suggest that policies may inadvertently increase health inequities, though
    in an unexpected direction - potentially because higher-educated women face greater scrutiny or have
    more to lose from policy consequences.
