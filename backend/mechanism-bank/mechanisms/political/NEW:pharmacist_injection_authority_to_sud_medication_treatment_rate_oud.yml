direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State pharmacy practice laws authorize pharmacists to administer medications via injection'
- 'Step 2: Legal authority enables pharmacists to provide long-acting injectable naltrexone directly to
  OUD patients'
- 'Step 3: Community pharmacies become accessible treatment sites, reducing reliance on specialty behavioral
  health settings'
- 'Step 4: Increased access points lead to greater treatment uptake and sustained medication adherence
  for OUD'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how state-level policy decisions regarding scope of practice
    directly shape healthcare access. The legislative/regulatory environment is a structural determinant
    that can either enable or constrain treatment options. Expanding pharmacist authority represents a
    policy lever to address systemic treatment gaps rather than expecting individuals to overcome access
    barriers.
