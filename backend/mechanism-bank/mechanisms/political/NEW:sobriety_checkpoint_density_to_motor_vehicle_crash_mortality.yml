- 'Step 1: Increased sobriety checkpoint density in a geographic area creates deterrent effect on alcohol-impaired
  driving'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving decreases proportion of drivers operating vehicles while intoxicated'
- 'Step 3: Fewer intoxicated drivers on roadways reduces collision risk from impaired judgment, reaction
  time, and motor control'
- 'Step 4: Lower motor vehicle crashes result in reduced injuries and fatalities'

description: The study background establishes that sobriety checkpoints reduce motor vehicle crashes,
  injuries, and fatalities through their deterrent effect on alcohol-impaired driving. The study's primary
  finding of geographically bounded effects on impaired driving provides mechanistic evidence for understanding
  the spatial reach of this public health intervention.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 178464
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Based on the finding that checkpoint effects on impaired driving are geographically
    bounded to local areas (~60,000 residents, ~3,000 roadway km), downstream effects on crashes and fatalities
    would similarly vary by geography based on checkpoint distribution.

  description: Broader geographic distribution of checkpoints would extend protective effects across more
    roadway kilometers and populations

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Given 1-week temporal decay of effects, more frequent checkpoint deployment would sustain
    deterrent effects over time
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how traffic safety enforcement operates as a structural
    determinant of injury mortality. The geographic boundedness of effects raises equity concerns about
    which communities receive protective checkpoint coverage. Rural areas with greater roadway distances
    may require different intervention strategies. Resource allocation for traffic safety enforcement
    reflects policy priorities that differentially affect population health across jurisdictions.
