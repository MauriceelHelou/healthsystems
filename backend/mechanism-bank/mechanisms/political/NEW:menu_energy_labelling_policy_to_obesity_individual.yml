- 'Step 1: Menu energy labelling policy designed to reduce obesity at population level'
- 'Step 2: Policy aims to shift consumer food selections toward lower calorie options'
- 'Step 3: If effective, reduced caloric intake would contribute to energy balance'
- 'Step 4: Sustained lower energy intake could reduce obesity prevalence over time'
- 'Step 5: However, current evidence shows minimal short-term behavioral effects, limiting potential obesity
  impact'

description: Energy labelling is a public health policy explicitly designed to improve diet and reduce
  obesity. The systematic review examined whether this policy differentially affects populations by socioeconomic
  position, given documented SEP disparities in obesity. While the policy shows equitable (non-differential)
  effects across SEP groups, the overall small effect sizes raise questions about its effectiveness as
  an obesity reduction strategy.

  description: Despite well-documented socioeconomic disparities in diet quality and obesity, the effect
    of energy labelling on consumer behavior did not differ by SEP

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the gap between policy intent and structural reality.
    Energy labelling addresses information asymmetry but not the structural determinants of diet-related
    health inequities (food cost, food environment, time poverty, food marketing). The finding that effects
    are equitable across SEP is positive from an equity standpoint, but the minimal overall effects suggest
    information-based policies alone cannot address structurally-driven obesity disparities. Root causes
    include food industry practices, economic constraints on healthy eating, and built environment factors
    that this policy does not address.
