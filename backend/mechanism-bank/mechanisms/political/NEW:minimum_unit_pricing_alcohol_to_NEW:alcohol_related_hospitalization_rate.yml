direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing (MUP) establishes a legally mandated floor price per unit of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: This increases the cost of cheap, high-strength alcohol products disproportionately consumed
  by heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Price increases reduce consumption among heaviest drinkers who experience most alcohol-related
  harms'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases acute alcohol-related health emergencies (e.g., poisoning,
  intoxication)'
- 'Step 5: Fewer alcohol-related hospital admissions result from decreased harmful consumption patterns'

description: Minimum unit pricing policies reduce alcohol-related hospitalizations by establishing a floor
  price that disproportionately affects cheap, high-strength alcohol products consumed by the heaviest
  drinkers. Modelling studies estimate 3-10% annual reductions while real-world studies demonstrate 2-9%
  reductions in acute alcohol-related admissions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention by targeting the commercial
    environment rather than individual behavior. MUP addresses the political economy of alcohol by regulating
    pricing to reduce population-level harm. The policy specifically benefits the most deprived populations
    who bear disproportionate alcohol-related health burdens, making it an equity-promoting intervention
    that addresses structural determinants of health inequalities.
