mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates supply chain disruption and increased demand for alcohol-based hand
  rubs'
- 'Step 2: Health Canada implements major regulatory changes to composition, handling, transportation,
  and packaging requirements'
- 'Step 3: Accelerated licensing allows ingredients and packaging that do not meet standard medical quality
  guidelines'
- 'Step 4: Products with substandard ethanol quality, improper packaging, and inadequate labeling enter
  the market'
- 'Step 5: Accountability relies on reactive measures including industry self-reporting and consumer complaints
  after products are already distributed'

description: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Health Canada relaxed regulations for alcohol-based hand rubs
  to address supply shortages, allowing products that did not meet standard medical quality guidelines
  to be manufactured and distributed, creating public health risks related to ethanol quality, packaging,
  and labeling.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how emergency policy decisions made at the governmental
    level create population-level exposures to potentially harmful products. The structural factors include
    regulatory framework design, market forces during crises, and the shift from proactive to reactive
    safety monitoring. Equity implications include differential exposure among populations with less access
    to information about product recalls or who rely on lower-cost products.
