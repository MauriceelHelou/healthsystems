description: Youth protection was the central strategic frame used by proponents to secure the constitutional
  amendment. The mechanism links advertising restrictions specifically to youth populations, targeting
  the developmental period when smoking initiation most commonly occurs.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the commercial determinants of health by restricting industry
    practices rather than targeting youth behavior. It recognizes that children and adolescents are particularly
    vulnerable to marketing influence and that structural restrictions are needed to protect them. The
    focus on youth protection rather than individual responsibility reflects a structural competency approach.
