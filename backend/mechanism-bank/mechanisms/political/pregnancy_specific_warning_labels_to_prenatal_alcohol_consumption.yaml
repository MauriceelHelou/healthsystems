mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy mandates specific warnings about pregnancy risks on alcohol containers,
  creating targeted messaging for pregnant persons and those who may become pregnant'
- 'Step 2: Pregnancy-specific labels increase awareness of fetal alcohol spectrum
  disorder risks and other prenatal harms at point of purchase'
- 'Step 3: Labels serve as environmental cue triggering consideration of pregnancy
  status and fetal health risks during alcohol decision-making'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced awareness and salience of pregnancy-specific risks influences
  intentions and behavior to avoid or reduce alcohol during pregnancy'
- 'Step 5: Structural intervention reduces information barriers that disproportionately
  affect populations with limited healthcare access'
