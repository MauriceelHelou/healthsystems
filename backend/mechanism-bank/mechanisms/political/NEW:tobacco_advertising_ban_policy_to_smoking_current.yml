description: This case study analyzes the successful 2022 Swiss constitutional referendum banning tobacco
  advertising reaching children and adolescents. The mechanism operates through policy change reducing
  commercial determinants of health, specifically tobacco marketing exposure to youth, which is an evidence-based
  measure for reducing smoking initiation and prevalence.

  variation_notes: Previous Swiss campaigns to ban tobacco advertising failed; success in 2022 compared
    to earlier failures suggests geographic and temporal variation in policy adoption

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention by targeting commercial determinants
    of health rather than individual behavior. The policy addresses the tobacco industry's marketing practices
    as a root cause of youth smoking, avoiding victim-blaming approaches. The analysis highlights how
    previous failures related to framing, coalition-building, and industry opposition - all structural
    factors. Equity implications include protecting youth who may have less agency in resisting marketing
    messages and reduced differential exposure to tobacco advertising across socioeconomic groups.
