direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry submissions deny effectiveness of evidence-based strategies to reduce harmful
  drinking'
- 'Step 2: Industry promotes alternative approaches without evidence base (71% of submissions)'
- 'Step 3: Governments fail to implement effective pricing, availability, and marketing policies'
- 'Step 4: Population continues to be exposed to environments promoting heavy episodic drinking'
- 'Step 5: Binge drinking rates remain elevated due to lack of protective policy intervention'

description: Alcohol industry influence on policy processes, through systematic promotion of alternatives
  without evidence (71% of submissions) and denial of effective strategies (91%), maintains environments
  conducive to binge drinking by preventing adoption of protective policies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how commercial determinants of health operate through
    political channels to shape drinking environments. The structural factors (policy environment, marketing
    exposure, pricing) that influence binge drinking are actively maintained by industry influence, placing
    responsibility at the systems level rather than on individual drinkers. Young people and lower-income
    populations are particularly vulnerable to marketing and pricing environments that evidence-based
    policies would address.
