mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adults placed on probation or parole are subject to criminal justice supervision requirements'
- 'Step 2: Supervision conditions often mandate substance use treatment as part of compliance requirements'
- 'Step 3: Court-ordered treatment leads to higher treatment receipt rates (15% alcohol, 16% drug) compared
  to actual disorder prevalence (8-11%)'
- 'Step 4: Treatment receipt becomes disconnected from clinical need, driven instead by legal mandates'

description: Criminal justice supervision (probation/parole) creates a mismatch between substance use
  disorder prevalence and treatment receipt, with 15-16% receiving treatment while only 8-11% meet SUD
  criteria. This suggests treatment is driven by legal requirements rather than clinical need.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how criminal justice involvement structures access to
    treatment independent of clinical need. The finding that treatment receipt exceeds disorder prevalence
    suggests systemic over-treatment driven by legal mandates rather than health needs. This represents
    a structural determinant where policy shapes healthcare utilization patterns.
