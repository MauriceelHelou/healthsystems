direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice policy provides sentencing time credits (reduced sentence) for individuals
  who initiate extended-release naltrexone'
- 'Step 2: Justice-involved individuals become motivated to seek information about and initiate MOUD to
  reduce their sentence length'
- 'Step 3: Increased MOUD initiation rates among justice-involved population with OUD'
- 'Step 4: Greater exposure to evidence-based treatment during vulnerable reentry period'

description: Structural incentives in the form of sentencing time credits facilitate MOUD initiation among
  justice-involved individuals. Clinicians reported clients were motivated to initiate extended-release
  naltrexone specifically because of resulting time off their sentences.

  description: Time credits specifically available for extended-release naltrexone, not buprenorphine
    or methadone, creating differential access based on medication type
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how criminal justice policy creates structural facilitators
    for treatment access. However, the limitation to extended-release naltrexone creates inequities as
    this may not be the most appropriate medication for all individuals with OUD. Policy could be expanded
    to include all evidence-based MOUD options.
