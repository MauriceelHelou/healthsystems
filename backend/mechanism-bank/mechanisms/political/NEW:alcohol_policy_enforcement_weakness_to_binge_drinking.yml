to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Weak enforcement of existing alcohol licensing laws allows violations to persist (12% of outlets
  within 100m of schools despite prohibition)'
- 'Step 2: Absence of age restriction signage (0% compliance at off-premise, 6% at on-premise outlets)
  removes visual deterrents to underage purchase'
- 'Step 3: Lack of systematic monitoring and reporting of outlet density prevents evidence-based policy
  intervention'
- 'Step 4: Regulatory gaps create permissive environment where commercial interests override public health
  protections'
- 'Step 5: Youth experience minimal barriers to alcohol access, increasing consumption rates'

description: Systemic weakness in alcohol policy enforcement, evidenced by widespread non-compliance with
  licensing distance requirements and age restriction signage, creates permissive environments that facilitate

  description: Off-premise outlets showed 0% compliance with 'no sale for <18' signage requirement, compared
    to 6% for on-premise
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers governmental and regulatory failure rather than individual
    vendor or consumer behavior. The study documents structural deficits in alcohol control policy implementation
    that create conditions for youth alcohol harm. The absence of systematic data collection on outlet
    density is itself identified as a barrier to evidence-based policymaking, highlighting how weak public
    health infrastructure perpetuates harmful environmental conditions.
