direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local governments develop alcohol and cannabis regulations through separate legislative processes'
- 'Step 2: Evidence-based alcohol control provisions (hours of sale limits, advertising restrictions,
  outlet density limits) not systematically applied to cannabis'
- 'Step 3: Only 2 of 241 localities regulated co-location of cannabis and alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 4: Policy provisions rarely aligned between substances (e.g., different hours of sale, advertising
  rules)'
- 'Step 5: Fragmented approach creates gaps in comprehensive public health protection from substance-related
  harms'

description: Local governments rarely adopted the same regulatory provisions for alcohol and cannabis
  despite public health recommendations for aligned approaches. This regulatory fragmentation - with different
  rules for hours of sale, advertising, and outlet density - creates gaps in public health protection,
  particularly as lessons learned from alcohol regulation are not systematically applied to newly legalized
  cannabis.

  description: Socioeconomically advantaged areas particularly likely to show policy misalignment (permissive
    alcohol, restrictive cannabis)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural failure in policy transfer and evidence-based
    regulation. The lack of policy alignment reflects political and economic factors (protecting established
    alcohol interests, NIMBY responses to cannabis) rather than public health evidence. This fragmentation
    may disproportionately affect communities with less political power to implement comprehensive substance
    regulation. The finding that only 2 localities addressed co-location represents a missed opportunity
    for coordinated harm reduction.
