- 'Step 1: Traditional treatment certification standards require psychosocial services before or concurrent
  with medication'
- 'Step 2: Prerequisite requirements create delays in medication initiation'
- 'Step 3: Delays during acute withdrawal periods increase risk of return to illicit opioid use'
- 'Step 4: Continued illicit use may prevent engagement with treatment altogether'
- 'Step 5: Overall medication utilization rates remain low despite evidence of effectiveness'

description: Traditional state certification standards for substance use disorder treatment programs often
  require psychosocial services as prerequisites or mandatory accompaniments to medication, creating structural
  barriers to timely medication access. The Missouri Department of Mental Health addressed this by implementing
  Medication First guidelines that emphasize timely access without requiring psychosocial services.

  description: State-level implementation of Medication First principles through treatment program guidelines
    can counteract traditional prerequisite barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies policy-level barriers (certification standards) as the
    root cause of low medication access, rather than patient characteristics or individual provider decisions.
    The comparison between traditional approach standards and Medication First guidelines demonstrates
    how regulatory frameworks shape treatment availability. This is a structural intervention targeting
    the policy environment of healthcare delivery.
