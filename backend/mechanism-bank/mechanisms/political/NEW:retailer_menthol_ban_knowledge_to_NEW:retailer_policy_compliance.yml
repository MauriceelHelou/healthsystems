description: High retailer awareness of menthol ban (86.4%) did not translate to full compliance, with
  over half continuing price promotions, suggesting knowledge alone is insufficient for policy implementation

  equity_implications: This finding highlights the gap between policy enactment and implementation. Effective
    tobacco control in communities targeted by industry marketing requires comprehensive approaches including
    retailer engagement, enforcement, and support systems rather than relying solely on knowledge dissemination.
