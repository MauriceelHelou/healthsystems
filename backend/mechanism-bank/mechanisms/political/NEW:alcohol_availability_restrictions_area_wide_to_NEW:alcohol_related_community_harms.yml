mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Section 64 provisions allow conditions to be placed on liquor licenses in specified communities'
- 'Step 2: Restrictions limit alcohol sales through mechanisms such as reduced off-premises trading hours'
- 'Step 3: Reduced community-wide alcohol availability decreases population-level exposure to alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Lower availability reduces risks to public health and safety at the community level'

description: The paper describes how evidence-informed policies that reduce community-wide alcohol availability
  are critical to addressing risks to public health and safety. While the primary focus of the study is
  on tourism outcomes, it contextualizes alcohol restrictions as public health interventions designed
  to reduce alcohol-related harms. The authors argue that objections to restrictions based on tourism
  concerns are 'misguided and counter-productive to sustainable tourism growth.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects a structural intervention approach - addressing alcohol
    harms through population-level availability restrictions rather than individual behavior change. This
    is consistent with evidence that environmental and policy-level interventions are more effective and
    equitable than approaches that rely on individual responsibility. The policy targets the commercial
    determinants of health (alcohol industry practices) rather than blaming individuals for alcohol-related
    problems.
