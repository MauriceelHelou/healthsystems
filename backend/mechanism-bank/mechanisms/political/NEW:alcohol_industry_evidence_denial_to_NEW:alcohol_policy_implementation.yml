- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry develops coordinated messaging strategies to dispute scientific evidence'
- 'Step 2: Industry arguments deployed consistently across different national contexts (similar arguments
  in Canada and Ireland)'
- 'Step 3: Evidence denial creates public uncertainty about established alcohol-cancer causal relationship'
- 'Step 4: Media amplification of industry perspectives shifts debate from implementation to re-litigating
  evidence'
- 'Step 5: Policy implementation is delayed or weakened due to manufactured controversy'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how corporate power operates structurally to shape the
    information environment and policy landscape. The consistency of industry arguments across national
    contexts suggests organized, well-resourced opposition to public health measures. This is a structural
    determinant because it reflects power asymmetries between commercial interests and public health advocates
    in shaping policy debates. Understanding these dynamics is essential for addressing commercial determinants
    of health.
