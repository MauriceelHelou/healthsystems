description: The study notes that the effect of major single population-based alcohol policies for Lithuania
  and other Baltic countries has been estimated to be of about the same magnitude as integrated policies
  (approximately 1 litre reduction in per capita consumption). This suggests that having at least one
  major effective policy is essential for success.

  description: Authors conclude integrated policies should include at least one major effective population-based
    policy, suggesting synergy between integration and having strong anchor policies

  equity_implications: This finding reinforces the importance of structural, population-based interventions
    over individual-focused approaches. Major policies (such as taxation, minimum unit pricing, or advertising
    restrictions) modify the commercial environment systematically, affecting all population members'
    exposure to alcohol. The comparable effect sizes between single major policies and integrated approaches
    suggests that structural policy interventions can be effective through multiple configurations, but
    must include substantive measures that alter alcohol availability, affordability, or marketing at
    population scale.
