mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative change reduces alcohol venue trading hours (from 5am to 3am closing)'
- 'Step 2: Patrons adapt by consuming more alcohol at home or other locations before entering entertainment
  districts'
- 'Step 3: Approximately 50% fewer people enter entertainment districts without having preloaded after
  legislation'
- 'Step 4: Patrons enter nightlife entertainment districts systematically later and more intoxicated'

description: Restrictive alcohol trading hour legislation led to unintended behavioral adaptation where
  patrons increased alcohol preloading before entering entertainment districts. The policy reduced venue
  operating hours but failed to account for cultural patterns of pre-drinking, resulting in patrons arriving
  later and more intoxicated.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how well-intentioned alcohol control policies can produce
    unintended consequences when they fail to account for existing cultural practices. The structural
    intervention (trading hour restrictions) shifted drinking from regulated venues to unregulated private
    spaces, potentially reducing oversight of intoxication levels. The policy represents a supply-side
    approach that did not address demand-side factors or the social context of preloading culture in young
    adults.
