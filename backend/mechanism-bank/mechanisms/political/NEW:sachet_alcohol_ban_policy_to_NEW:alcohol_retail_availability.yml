  description: Ban significantly reduced alcohol availability in off-premise establishments (p<.001) but
    not in on-premise establishments (p=.710)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how national alcohol policy can structurally modify
    the commercial availability environment. The differential effect by premise type suggests that structural
    interventions may have varying impacts across different commercial contexts, requiring tailored enforcement
    strategies.
