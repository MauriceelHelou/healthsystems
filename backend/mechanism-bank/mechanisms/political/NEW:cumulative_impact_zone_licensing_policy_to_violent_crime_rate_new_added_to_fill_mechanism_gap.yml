mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative impact zones restrict new alcohol outlet licenses in areas with high existing outlet
  density'
- 'Step 2: Reduced spatial availability of alcohol decreases opportunities for alcohol purchase and public
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol availability reduces population-level alcohol consumption in affected areas'
- 'Step 4: Reduced intoxication levels decrease alcohol-related violent behavior including interpersonal
  violence'
- 'Step 5: Violent crime rates decline as alcohol-attributable violence decreases'

description: Local alcohol licensing policies including cumulative impact zones that restrict spatial
  availability of alcohol are associated with 4-6% greater declines in violent crime rates compared to
  areas without such policies. High-intensity policy areas saw violent crime decline by approximately
  1.2 per 1000 population compared to 0.6 per 1000 in passive policy areas.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention by targeting the commercial
    and regulatory environment rather than individual drinking behaviors. By restricting alcohol outlet
    density through cumulative impact zones, local authorities address the upstream determinants of alcohol-related
    violence. This approach acknowledges that violence is not simply a matter of individual choice but
    is shaped by the spatial distribution of alcohol availability. The policy specifically targets areas
    with existing high outlet density, potentially addressing concentrated disadvantage.
