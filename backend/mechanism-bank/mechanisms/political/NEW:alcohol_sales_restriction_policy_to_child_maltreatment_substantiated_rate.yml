direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policies restricting alcohol sales hours or volumes limit temporal and quantity access to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Restrictions reduce overall alcohol consumption and particularly heavy drinking occasions'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol-related impairment among parents/caregivers decreases episodes of neglect and
  abuse'
- 'Step 4: Community-level reduction in alcohol-related family violence and child endangerment'
- 'Step 5: Fewer child maltreatment cases substantiated by child protective services'

description: Policies restricting alcohol sales predict a 9.6% reduction in substantiated child maltreatment.
  While smaller than comprehensive bans, this demonstrates that partial restrictions on alcohol availability
  still provide meaningful child protection at the population level.

  equity_implications: This finding supports harm reduction through environmental modification rather
    than individual-level intervention. By limiting when and how much alcohol can be sold, communities
    can reduce child maltreatment without requiring individual behavior change programs. This is particularly
    important for equity as it provides universal protection regardless of individual resources for treatment
    or services.
