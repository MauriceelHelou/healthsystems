direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief mindfulness-based interventions are delivered online to increase accessibility and reduce
  barriers to treatment'
- 'Step 2: Mindfulness training aims to enhance awareness of craving states and reduce automatic reactivity
  to triggers'
- 'Step 3: Improved self-regulation and craving management theoretically reduces cannabis use frequency
  and quantity'
- 'Step 4: However, brief interventions may lack sufficient intensity to produce measurable changes in
  entrenched substance use patterns'

description: This RCT tested whether brief online mindfulness-based intervention reduces cannabis use
  frequency, quantity, and craving in adults with cannabis use disorder compared to relaxation and passive
  control conditions. Results showed no significant intervention-by-time effects on cannabis frequency
  (F=0.26, p=.86) or secondary outcomes including quantity, cravings, relaxation, or mindfulness. The
  null findings suggest that brief, scalable mindfulness interventions may be insufficient to address
  entrenched cannabis use patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This study addresses treatment accessibility by testing a low-cost, scalable, online
    intervention - recognizing that structural barriers (cost, geographic access, time constraints) limit
    treatment engagement for substance use disorders. The null findings highlight that while removing
    access barriers is necessary, it may not be sufficient; more intensive structural supports and treatment
    approaches may be needed. The study does not examine how structural factors (poverty, housing instability,
    criminalization) contribute to cannabis use disorder or treatment outcomes.
