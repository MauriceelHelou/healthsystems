direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking episodes expose the liver to acute high concentrations of
  alcohol, overwhelming hepatic metabolic capacity and generating toxic acetaldehyde
  and reactive oxygen species'
- 'Step 2: Repeated binge drinking causes cumulative hepatocyte damage, triggering
  inflammatory responses, hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), and progressive fibrosis'
- 'Step 3: Continued binge drinking pattern accelerates progression from fibrosis
  to cirrhosis, with impaired liver regeneration and increased susceptibility to liver
  failure'
- 'Step 4: Advanced alcoholic liver disease leads to complications including portal
  hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and ultimately increased mortality from liver
  failure or hepatocellular carcinoma'

description: Binge drinking directly increases risk of alcoholic liver disease mortality
  through repeated acute toxic insults to hepatocytes. The pattern of heavy episodic
  drinking is particularly damaging to the liver, as it overwhelms detoxification
  capacity and promotes inflammatory and fibrotic processes. Meta-analyses confirm
  that liver disease shows a monotonic relationship with alcohol volume, with additional
  risk from binge patterns. Recent U.S. trends show concurrent increases in binge
  drinking prevalence and alcoholic liver disease mortality, particularly among middle-aged
  and older adults.

  description: Middle-aged (50-64) and older adults (65+) show the largest increases
    in binge drinking prevalence, which may be driving increasing alcohol-related
    morbidity and mortality including liver disease
- name: sex
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Trends in binge drinking differ by sex, with differential impacts on
    liver disease risk; women may be more susceptible to alcohol-related liver damage
    at lower consumption levels
- name: drinking pattern
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Heavy drinking occasions (binge pattern) specifically increase liver
    disease risk beyond total volume consumed; pattern of drinking is independently
    important for liver outcomes
- name: alcohol quality
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: For liver cirrhosis specifically, quality of alcohol consumed is an
    additional risk factor beyond volume and pattern
