- 'Step 5: Problematic gambling develops through continuous access and reduced social barriers to gambling'

description: The systematic review found that among adults who gamble, those using online casino or slots
  formats have the highest rates of problematic gambling at 15.8% (95% CI 10.7-21.6). The growth of the
  online gambling industry represents a structural factor that increases population-level exposure to
  gambling and subsequently problematic gambling behaviors.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies the regulatory environment and growth of the online gambling
    industry as structural determinants of problematic gambling, rather than blaming individual choices.
    The paper explicitly calls for governments to give greater attention to strict regulation and monitoring
    of gambling globally. The lack of regulatory barriers to online gambling creates differential exposure
    across populations.
