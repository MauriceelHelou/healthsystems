direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) exposes individuals to opioids
  outside of medical supervision, often involving higher doses, more frequent use,
  or alternative routes of administration than prescribed'
- 'Step 2: NMPOU leads to development of opioid tolerance, requiring progressively
  higher doses to achieve desired effects, increasing risk of respiratory depression'
- 'Step 3: Without medical oversight, users lack awareness of safe dosing thresholds,
  potential drug interactions, and signs of overdose'
- 'Step 4: NMPOU is associated with progression to opioid use disorder, which further
  escalates use patterns and risk-taking behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Acute overdose occurs when opioid dose exceeds respiratory capacity, leading
  to respiratory depression, hypoxia, and death if not reversed'

description: A large systematic review of 182 studies identified a robust association
  between non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) and fatal overdose. The evidence
  base demonstrates that NMPOU contributes substantially to morbidity through multiple
  pathways, with the strongest evidence supporting associations with opioid use disorder
  and both fatal and non-fatal overdose. The mechanism operates through unsupervised
  opioid exposure leading to tolerance, dose escalation, and ultimately respiratory
  depression at toxic doses.
