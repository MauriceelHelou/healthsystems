direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Combined use of cannabis and alcohol produces synergistic pharmacological effects on CNS function'
- 'Step 2: Lateral control impairment significantly exceeds that of either substance alone (g=0.480 vs
  alcohol; g=0.336 vs cannabis)'
- 'Step 3: Time out of lane increases substantially compared to single substance use (g=0.525 vs alcohol;
  g=0.475 vs cannabis)'
- 'Step 4: Multiplicative impairment effects dramatically increase crash probability and severity'

description: The combination of cannabis and alcohol produces significantly greater driving impairment
  than either substance alone, with synergistic effects on lateral control (g=0.480 vs alcohol alone;
  g=0.336 vs cannabis alone) and time out of lane (g=0.525 vs alcohol; g=0.475 vs cannabis). This polysubstance
  pattern substantially elevates crash risk.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Structural factors include co-location of alcohol and cannabis retail, marketing
    practices that normalize concurrent use, limited public education about polysubstance risks, and inadequate
    alternative transportation infrastructure. Policy gaps exist where cannabis legalization occurs without
    corresponding impaired driving countermeasures. Equity implications include differential exposure
    to marketing, enforcement disparities, and transportation access barriers in low-income communities.
