structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Smoking cessation is influenced by structural factors including tobacco industry
    marketing, taxation policies, smoke-free regulations, and availability of cessation resources. E-cigarette
    access represents a modifiable structural factor that can reduce smoking prevalence. Equity concerns
    include ensuring regulated product access across socioeconomic groups.
