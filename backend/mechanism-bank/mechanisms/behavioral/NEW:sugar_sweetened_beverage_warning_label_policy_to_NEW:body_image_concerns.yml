direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Certain warning label formats (particularly exercise equivalents and some health effect messages)
  emphasize weight and body-related outcomes'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to weight-focused messaging may trigger or exacerbate body image concerns'
- 'Step 3: Vulnerable populations (youth, those with eating disorder history) may experience unintended
  psychological harms'
- 'Step 4: Policy produces unintended negative consequences alongside intended SSB reduction'

description: Some warning label formats may produce unintended negative consequences related to body image,
  particularly exercise equivalent labels. The text teaspoons format was noted to have minimal such negative
  issues, suggesting label design can mitigate these harms.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of equity-conscious policy design. Weight-focused
    health messaging can perpetuate weight stigma and harm vulnerable populations, including those with
    eating disorders. The finding that simpler sugar content labels (teaspoons) avoid these harms while
    maintaining effectiveness demonstrates how structural interventions can be designed to achieve health
    goals without producing disparate negative impacts. Policy makers must consider unintended consequences
    across diverse populations.
