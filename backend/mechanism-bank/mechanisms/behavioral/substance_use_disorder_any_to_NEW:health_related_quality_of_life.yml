- 'Step 1: Substance and behavioral addictions impair physical health domains (pain, mobility, energy)'
- 'Step 2: Addiction-related social consequences reduce social functioning and relationships'
- 'Step 3: Psychological distress and mental health comorbidities reduce emotional well-being'
- 'Step 4: Economic consequences of addiction (job loss, financial strain) affect material well-being'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effects across multiple domains reduce overall quality of life'

description: This systematic review of 298 articles (330 studies) examined quality of life and health-related
  quality of life as outcomes in substance and behavioral addictions. The review identified 53 different
  measurement instruments across 41 unique domains of QoL, with instruments like WHOQOL-BREF, AQoLS, ALQoL-9,
  Q-LES-Q-SF, SF-12, DUQoL, QLI and SF-36 showing promising internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.70).
  However, limited high-quality validation evidence exists for QoL measurement in addiction populations.

  equity_implications: While this review focuses on measurement of QoL in addiction, it highlights the
    multidimensional impact of addiction on life quality spanning physical, psychological, social, and
    environmental domains. Structural factors that increase addiction risk (economic disadvantage, lack
    of treatment access, social marginalization) would compound QoL impacts. The lack of validated instruments
    specifically for addiction populations represents a structural barrier to assessing treatment effectiveness
    and understanding population-level impacts of addiction. Equity implications include potential measurement
    bias when using instruments not validated in diverse addiction populations.
