description: Alcohol use after TBI is a key predictor of rehabilitation outcomes and prognosis. Continued
  alcohol consumption impairs neurological recovery, reduces therapy effectiveness, and increases risk
  of subsequent head injuries, creating a cycle of worsening outcomes.

  equity_implications: Rehabilitation outcomes are strongly influenced by structural factors including
    insurance coverage for comprehensive rehabilitation, availability of specialized TBI programs, integration
    of substance use treatment, and community support systems. Individuals from marginalized communities
    face barriers to accessing integrated care, perpetuating health inequities.
