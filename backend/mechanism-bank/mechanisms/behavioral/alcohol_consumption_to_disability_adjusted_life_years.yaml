direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption leads to both fatal and non-fatal health consequences
  across multiple disease categories'
- 'Step 2: Non-fatal consequences include alcohol use disorders, injuries, and chronic
  diseases that cause ongoing disability'
- 'Step 3: Years lived with disability (YLD) combined with years of life lost (YLL)
  from premature mortality generate substantial DALY burden'
- 'Step 4: Mathematical models aggregate these impacts to estimate total population-level
  disease burden'
