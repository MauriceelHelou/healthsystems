direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pictorial health warning labels combine graphic images with text warnings on alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Visual imagery creates stronger emotional response and increased salience compared to text
  alone'
- 'Step 3: Dual-coding of information (visual + verbal) enhances message processing and recall'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced risk perception at point of selection influences purchasing decisions'
- 'Step 5: Reduced selection of alcohol products displaying image-and-text warnings'

description: Image-and-text (pictorial) health warning labels on alcohol products show a 35% reduction
  in product selection compared to no-label controls, with potentially stronger effects than text-only
  warnings.

  equity_implications: Pictorial warnings represent a more intensive structural intervention that leverages
    visual communication to overcome literacy barriers and increase message impact across diverse populations.
    This policy approach transfers responsibility for health communication from individuals to regulated
    labeling requirements, potentially reducing disparities in health information access. The stronger
    effect of pictorial warnings suggests policy should mandate graphic imagery for maximum population
    health benefit.
