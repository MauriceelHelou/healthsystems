direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol sales at retail outlets lead to higher population-level per capita alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption occurs in social settings or leads to impaired judgment about COVID-19
  precautions'
- 'Step 3: Reduced adherence to physical distancing, mask-wearing, and other public health measures'
- 'Step 4: Increased person-to-person contact and viral transmission opportunities'
- 'Step 5: Higher COVID-19 infection rates observed 2-3 weeks after consumption increase (incubation +
  reporting lag)'

description: Population-level per capita alcohol consumption predicted COVID-19 infection rates 2 weeks
  later, with a 6.34% increase in infections per one drink/week increase in consumption. This relationship
  reflects how alcohol retail availability and consumption patterns during pandemic restrictions influenced
  viral transmission dynamics.

  description: On-premise outlets (bars/restaurants) showed much larger effect sizes (+77.27% per standard
    drink/person/week at 2 weeks) compared to government liquor stores (+6.49%) or private liquor stores
    (+7.13%), likely due to social consumption settings

  strength: moderate
  description: Consumption was positively associated with stringency of public health measures, suggesting
    compensatory drinking behavior during lockdowns
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how alcohol policy decisions (expanding home delivery
    options and trading hours for liquor stores during COVID-19) created conditions for increased consumption.
    The structural framing avoids individual blame by focusing on population-level consumption patterns
    shaped by government alcohol distribution policies. The finding that on-premise outlets showed stronger
    effects than retail stores suggests social environment factors mediate transmission risk.
