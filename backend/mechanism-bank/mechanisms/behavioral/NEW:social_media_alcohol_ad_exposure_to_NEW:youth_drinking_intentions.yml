  underage minors, representing a failure of current regulatory approaches to protect youth from commercial

  description: Both YouTube (video-based) and Instagram (image-based) platforms show effects, suggesting
    cross-platform vulnerability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers the structural failure of alcohol advertising regulation
    in the digital age. Social media platforms have become a primary vector for alcohol marketing to reach
    underage populations. The authors explicitly frame this as a regulatory and policy issue, noting that
    advertising hinders consumer well-being. The equity implications include differential exposure based
    on platform use patterns and algorithmic targeting that may vary by demographic factors.
