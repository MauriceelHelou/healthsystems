direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic or heavy alcohol consumption leads to repeated hepatic exposure
  to ethanol and its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde causes direct hepatocyte injury, oxidative stress, and inflammatory
  responses in the liver'
- 'Step 3: Persistent inflammation triggers activation of hepatic stellate cells,
  leading to excessive collagen deposition and fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis disrupts normal liver architecture, eventually resulting
  in cirrhosis with impaired liver function'
- 'Step 5: Advanced cirrhosis leads to liver failure requiring hospitalization for
  complications such as ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy'

description: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 longitudinal and case-control
  studies demonstrates a strong positive dose-response relationship between alcohol
  consumption and liver cirrhosis risk. The relationship is non-linear, with risk
  increasing exponentially at higher consumption levels. At 80g/day alcohol consumption,
  relative risk is 7.93 (95% CI: 7.12-8.83) for males and 23.32 (95% CI: 18.24-29.82)
  for females, indicating females are at substantially higher risk at equivalent consumption
  levels.'
