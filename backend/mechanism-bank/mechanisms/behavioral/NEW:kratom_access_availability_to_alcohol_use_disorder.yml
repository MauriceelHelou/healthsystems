direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Kratom produces both opioid and stimulant-like effects depending on dose'
- 'Step 2: These effects may reduce alcohol craving through cross-substitution mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Early preclinical evidence suggests kratom may modulate reward pathways relevant to alcohol
  dependence'
- 'Step 4: Individuals may use kratom as a harm reduction tool to reduce alcohol consumption'

description: Kratom may serve as a harm reduction agent for alcohol use disorder, though current evidence
  is limited to early preclinical and observational research

  description: Perceived stigma and reluctance to seek care may increase kratom use as alternative
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Limited pharmacotherapy options for alcohol use disorder and barriers to treatment
    access create conditions where individuals seek alternatives. Stigma around alcohol use disorder is
    a structural barrier that shapes help-seeking behavior.
