- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for head and neck cancer'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolites cause direct DNA damage to oral and pharyngeal mucosa'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol acts as a solvent enhancing penetration of other carcinogens (tobacco)'
- 'Step 4: Chronic alcohol use depletes tissue antioxidants and impairs immune surveillance'
- 'Step 5: Mediterranean diet adherence may partially counteract alcohol-related carcinogenic pathways
  through antioxidant provision'

description: The paper identifies alcohol consumption as an established risk factor for head and neck
  cancer, operating alongside tobacco use and viral infections. The Mediterranean diet's protective effect
  may partially offset alcohol-related carcinogenic mechanisms, suggesting dietary intervention as a complementary
  cancer prevention strategy.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol consumption patterns are shaped by structural factors including alcohol
    outlet density, alcohol pricing policies, marketing exposure, economic stress, and neighborhood disadvantage.
    Communities with higher alcohol outlet density and fewer resources for substance use treatment face
    elevated structural risk for alcohol-related cancers. The interaction between diet and alcohol suggests
    multi-level intervention opportunities.
