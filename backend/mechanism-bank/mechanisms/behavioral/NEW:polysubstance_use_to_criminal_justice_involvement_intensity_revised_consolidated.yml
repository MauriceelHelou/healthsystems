direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Polysubstance use (using more than one type of substance) increases risk of drug-related offenses
  and associated arrests'
- 'Step 2: Combined substance effects impair judgment and increase likelihood of behaviors leading to
  criminal justice contact'
- 'Step 3: Drug policies criminalize possession and use, leading to arrests, pretrial detention, and incarceration'
- 'Step 4: Criminal justice system contact creates cycles of involvement through probation violations
  and recidivism'

description: Polysubstance use disproportionately impacts those involved in the criminal justice system,
  with review evidence demonstrating syndemic relationships between substance use patterns and criminal
  justice involvement across multiple populations

  description: Paper explicitly notes limited focus on racial/ethnic disparities in current research,
    suggesting differential impacts exist but are understudied
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how drug criminalization policies create pathways from
    substance use to criminal justice involvement. The paper explicitly notes the need for greater attention
    to social determinants of health and racial/ethnic disparities, acknowledging structural factors.
    The syndemic framing recognizes interconnected social and health problems rather than individual blame.
