direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis consumption results in THC crossing blood-brain barrier and binding to cannabinoid
  receptors'
- 'Step 2: Impaired lateral vehicle control manifests as increased lane position variability (g=0.331)
  and lane excursions (g=0.198)'
- 'Step 3: Compensatory reduction in driving speed (g=-0.176) partially mitigates but does not eliminate
  crash risk'
- 'Step 4: Impaired hazard response and vehicle control increases probability of motor vehicle crashes
  and injuries'

description: Cannabis impairs driving performance by reducing lateral vehicle control (increased lane
  position variability and lane excursions), though drivers may partially compensate by reducing speed.
  This impairment pattern increases motor vehicle crash risk.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to drug policy and cannabis legalization contexts. Structural
    factors include availability of cannabis, lack of roadside testing infrastructure, inadequate public
    education, and limited alternative transportation options. Equity implications include differential
    enforcement of drugged driving laws across racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic barriers to alternatives
    to driving.
