direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption disrupts sleep architecture by interfering with normal
  sleep cycles and reducing REM sleep quality'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol acts as a central nervous system depressant initially but causes
  rebound arousal during metabolism, fragmenting sleep continuity'
- 'Step 3: Repeated alcohol use in adolescents affects developing neurobiological
  systems that regulate circadian rhythms and sleep-wake homeostasis'
- 'Step 4: These physiological disruptions manifest as difficulty initiating sleep,
  frequent nighttime awakenings, and early morning arousal characteristic of insomnia'
