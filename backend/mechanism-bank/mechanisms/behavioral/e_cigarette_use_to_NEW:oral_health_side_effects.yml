direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-combustible nicotine products (NCNPs) including electronic nicotine delivery systems expose
  oral mucosa to nicotine and other chemicals'
- 'Step 2: Chemical exposure causes local irritation and inflammatory responses in oral tissues'
- 'Step 3: Sustained exposure leads to oral side effects including aphthous ulcers, dry mouth (xerostomia),
  and mouth irritation'
- 'Step 4: These oral health effects may affect quality of life and oral disease risk'

description: This protocol describes a planned systematic review and network meta-analysis examining the
  association between non-combustible nicotine products and oral health effects including aphthous ulcers,
  dry mouth, and mouth irritation in adult smokers. The review aims to compare NCNPs to each other, placebo,
  standard care, no treatment, and combustible cigarette smoking.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While primarily examining behavioral exposures, this research has structural implications
    for tobacco harm reduction policy. NCNPs are positioned as harm reduction alternatives for smokers
    unable or unwilling to quit, which has implications for public health regulatory decisions. Understanding
    oral health effects can inform clinical guidance and consumer protection policies. The exclusion of
    non-smokers, pregnant women, and those with mental health conditions limits generalizability to vulnerable
    populations who may face different structural barriers to smoking cessation.
