direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Older adults with nicotine dependence have established patterns of inhaled substance use'
- 'Step 2: Shared administration routes and behavioral patterns facilitate concurrent marijuana use'
- 'Step 3: Polysubstance use patterns reinforce continued marijuana use alongside tobacco'
- 'Step 4: Nicotine dependence reduces likelihood of transitioning from marijuana use to nonuse'

description: Nicotine dependence was associated with a lower likelihood of use-to-nonuse compared to continued
  marijuana use, suggesting that tobacco addiction supports sustained marijuana use patterns among older
  adults.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural factors underlying nicotine dependence including
    tobacco industry marketing, inadequate cessation support, and environmental exposures. The co-occurrence
    of nicotine and marijuana use suggests need for integrated substance use interventions addressing
    multiple substances.
