mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students who engage in heavy drinking have increased risk of driving after drinking'
- 'Step 2: Driving after drinking impairs cognitive function, reaction time, and motor coordination'
- 'Step 3: Impaired driving increases probability of traffic accidents'
- 'Step 4: Persistence of driving after drinking patterns over time extends risk into adulthood'
- 'Step 5: Elevated rates of alcohol-involved traffic accidents and deaths among this population'

description: The paper establishes the background mechanism that college students who drink are at increased
  risk of driving after drinking and subsequent alcohol-involved traffic accidents and deaths. The persistence
  of driving after drinking behaviors over time creates need for effective early interventions to prevent
  future drunk driving in adulthood.

  description: College students represent a high-risk population for both heavy drinking and driving after
    drinking; 58% of sample were first-year students
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism reflects structural factors including: campus alcohol environments,
    transportation infrastructure (or lack thereof) in college towns, social norms around drinking and
    driving in college culture, and developmental timing of intervention. Addressing this requires systemic
    approaches including campus policy, alternative transportation, and evidence-based prevention programming
    rather than solely individual-level blame.'
