direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals receiving pharmacotherapies (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) for opioid use
  disorder may concurrently use cannabis'
- 'Step 2: Cannabis use could theoretically interact with opioid treatment through shared neurobiological
  pathways involving endocannabinoid and opioid receptor systems'
- 'Step 3: Meta-analysis of longitudinal studies finds no statistically significant association between
  cannabis use and return to non-medical opioid use during treatment'
- 'Step 4: Pooled analysis suggests cannabis use neither increases nor decreases risk of non-medical opioid
  use among those in MOUD treatment'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 longitudinal studies (N=8,367) found no significant
  association between cannabis use and non-medical opioid use among patients receiving medications for
  opioid use disorder. The pooled odds ratio was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.97-1.04, p=0.98), indicating cannabis
  use neither increased nor decreased the risk of returning to non-medical opioid use during MOUD treatment.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding has important policy implications for substance use treatment programs.
    Many MOUD programs require cannabis abstinence as a condition of treatment enrollment or continuation.
    The null finding challenges this structural barrier to treatment access, suggesting that cannabis
    abstinence requirements may unnecessarily restrict access to life-saving opioid treatment without
    evidence of benefit. This has equity implications as cannabis policies and enforcement disproportionately
    affect marginalized communities, creating additional barriers to OUD treatment for already underserved
    populations.
