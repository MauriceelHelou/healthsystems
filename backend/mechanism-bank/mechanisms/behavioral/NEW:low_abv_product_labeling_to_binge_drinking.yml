direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Products are labeled or described as having lower alcohol content'
- 'Step 2: Consumers perceive lower-ABV products as safer or less consequential'
- 'Step 3: Consumption quantity increases as perceived risk decreases'
- 'Step 4: Total alcohol consumption rises despite lower per-drink ABV'

description: When products indicate lower alcohol content through ABV percentage or verbal descriptors,
  consumption tends to increase, potentially negating harm reduction benefits.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how product labeling and marketing (structural/commercial
    determinants) influence consumption patterns. Policy interventions around labeling requirements and
    marketing restrictions could address this pathway. The mechanism recognizes that individual behavior
    is shaped by commercial information environment.
