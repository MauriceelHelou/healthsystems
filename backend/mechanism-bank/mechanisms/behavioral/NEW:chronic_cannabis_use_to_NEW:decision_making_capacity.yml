- 'Step 1: Regular cannabis use (≥4x/weekly) in healthy individuals affects prefrontal cortical function'
- 'Step 2: Altered dopaminergic and endocannabinoid signaling impacts reward processing'
- 'Step 3: Impaired ability to learn from negative outcomes on decision-making tasks'
- 'Step 4: Reduced performance on Iowa Gambling Task measuring decision-making under uncertainty'

description: Chronic cannabis use (≥4x/weekly) is associated with impaired decision-making in healthy
  participants as measured by Iowa Gambling Task performance, but this relationship is reversed in individuals
  with bipolar disorder where cannabis use is associated with better decision-making.

  description: In individuals with bipolar disorder, cannabis use was associated with IMPROVED decision-making
    compared to non-using BD counterparts, opposite to the effect seen in healthy controls

  equity_implications: This finding highlights the importance of considering psychiatric comorbidity when
    developing substance use policies. Blanket prohibition may fail to account for differential effects
    across populations. The study suggests potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids for specific
    clinical populations, raising questions about equitable access to emerging treatments.
