mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption impairs central nervous system function affecting psychomotor coordination'
- 'Step 2: Driving performance decrements occur across multiple domains including lateral control and
  hazard response'
- 'Step 3: Impaired vehicle control and reaction time increases probability of crashes'
- 'Step 4: Motor vehicle crashes result in injuries and fatalities'

description: Alcohol impairs driving performance through multiple mechanisms affecting psychomotor function,
  increasing crash risk. The study confirms alcohol's detrimental effects on driving and provides comparison
  benchmark for cannabis effects.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Structural determinants include alcohol outlet density, pricing policies, advertising
    regulations, and availability of alternative transportation. Enforcement of drunk driving laws varies
    by jurisdiction and demographic group. Economic factors influence both alcohol consumption patterns
    and access to alternatives to driving while impaired.
