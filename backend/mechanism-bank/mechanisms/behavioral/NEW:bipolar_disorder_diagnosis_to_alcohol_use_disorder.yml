mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bipolar disorder creates significant mood dysregulation including manic and depressive episodes'
- 'Step 2: Individuals may use alcohol as self-medication to manage mood symptoms and emotional distress'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological vulnerabilities shared between bipolar disorder and addiction increase susceptibility
  to alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system fragmentation often fails to provide integrated mental health and substance
  use treatment'
- 'Step 5: High comorbidity rate (29.12% AUD prevalence) reflects structural gaps in coordinated care
  for dual diagnosis'

description: Meta-analysis of 20 studies across 12 countries found that 29.12% of individuals with bipolar
  disorder have comorbid alcohol use disorder. This high prevalence reflects the intersection of neurobiological
  vulnerabilities, self-medication patterns, and structural healthcare system failures to provide integrated
  dual-diagnosis treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights structural healthcare deficits rather than individual
    blame. The high comorbidity rate (nearly 1 in 3 bipolar patients) indicates systemic failures in:
    (1) integrated behavioral health services, (2) early intervention and screening protocols, (3) accessible
    dual-diagnosis treatment programs. The paper explicitly calls for ''targeted interventions'' as a
    public health imperative, framing the issue as a systems-level challenge requiring structural solutions.'
