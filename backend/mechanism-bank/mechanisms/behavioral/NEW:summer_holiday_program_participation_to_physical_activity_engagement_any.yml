category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Summer holiday programs incorporate structured physical activity components into daily programming'
- 'Step 2: Children receive supervised opportunities for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity that may
  not be available at home'
- 'Step 3: Program environments provide equipment, space, and peer interaction that facilitate physical
  activity'
- 'Step 4: Regular participation maintains physical activity levels during a period when they typically
  decline'

description: Summer holiday programs demonstrate a significant small effect on improving moderate-to-vigorous
  physical activity in school-aged children (g=0.35). Programs counteract the typical decline in physical
  activity that occurs during summer vacation by providing structured opportunities for movement.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural interventions (community programs) can
    address the physical activity gap during summer months. Without such programs, children from lower-income
    families may have reduced access to safe spaces, equipment, and supervision for physical activity,
    potentially widening health disparities. The lack of differential effects by sociodemographic characteristics
    suggests these programs may have equitable benefits when access is provided.
