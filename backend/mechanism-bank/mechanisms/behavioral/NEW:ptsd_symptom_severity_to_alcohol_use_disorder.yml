mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated PTSD symptoms create psychological distress and hyperarousal states'
- 'Step 2: Individuals may use alcohol as a maladaptive coping mechanism to self-medicate trauma symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol consumption reinforces avoidance behaviors central to PTSD'
- 'Step 4: Greater alcohol use develops over subsequent weeks as symptom severity remains elevated'

description: Greater PTSD symptom severity is prospectively associated with greater future alcohol use
  during integrated treatment, supporting the self-medication hypothesis within the mutual maintenance
  model. The effect size for PTSD symptoms predicting future alcohol use was larger than the reciprocal
  relationship.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how trauma exposure (often rooted in structural factors
    like military service, community violence, or adverse childhood experiences) can drive substance use.
    Veterans face unique structural exposures including combat trauma, military sexual trauma, and challenges
    reintegrating into civilian life. Sequential treatment models that require abstinence before trauma
    treatment create structural barriers to care that perpetuate this cycle.
