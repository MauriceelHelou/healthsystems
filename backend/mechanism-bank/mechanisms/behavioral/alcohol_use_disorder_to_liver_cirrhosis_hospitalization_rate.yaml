- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to chronic excessive alcohol consumption, causing
  direct hepatotoxicity and inflammatory processes in liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: Persistent alcohol-induced liver injury progresses through stages from
  fatty liver to fibrosis to cirrhosis, with AUD patients showing 51% prevalence of
  alcohol-associated liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Advanced liver disease and cirrhosis complications result in hepatic decompensation,
  requiring hospitalization for management of portal hypertension, ascites, and other
  cirrhosis-related complications'

description: Alcohol use disorder significantly increases the risk of liver cirrhosis
  and related hospitalizations through a progressive pathway of alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity.
  Meta-analytic evidence shows AUD patients have a 51% prevalence of alcohol-associated
  liver disease compared to 3.5% in general populations, with a 3.3-fold increased
  risk of decompensated liver cirrhosis requiring hospitalization. The mechanism involves
  chronic alcohol exposure causing inflammatory liver injury that progresses through
  fibrosis to cirrhosis, ultimately leading to complications requiring hospital care.
structural_competency_notes: Access to addiction treatment services, healthcare screening
  programs, and socioeconomic factors influence both AUD treatment engagement and
  early detection of liver disease, potentially affecting hospitalization rates through
  delayed diagnosis and intervention.
