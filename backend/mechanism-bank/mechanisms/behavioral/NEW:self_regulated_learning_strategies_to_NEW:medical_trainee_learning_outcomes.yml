direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medical trainees engage in self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies including goal-setting,
  self-monitoring, and metacognitive reflection'
- 'Step 2: SRL strategies enable trainees to identify knowledge gaps and adapt study approaches'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced self-regulation leads to improved cognitive processing and retention of medical knowledge'
- 'Step 4: Better learning outcomes manifest across affective, cognitive, and behavioral domains'

description: This meta-analysis of 61 studies demonstrates that self-regulated learning strategies are
  positively associated with learning outcomes in medical education (r = .212). The effect is stronger
  for affective outcomes and during clinical clerkship phases, suggesting that active learning self-regulation
  becomes more impactful as trainees engage in clinical practice.

  equity_implications: 'While this study focuses on individual learning strategies, it has implications
    for medical education policy and curriculum design. Structural factors that could enhance SRL include:
    curriculum designs that support metacognitive development, protected time for reflection, institutional
    support for self-directed learning, and reducing structural barriers (workload, sleep deprivation)
    that impair self-regulation capacity. Better trained physicians may contribute to improved population
    health outcomes and reduced health disparities through enhanced clinical competence.'
