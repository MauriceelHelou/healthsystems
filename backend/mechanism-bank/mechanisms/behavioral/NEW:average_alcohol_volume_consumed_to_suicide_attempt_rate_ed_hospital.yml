  node_name: Suicide Attempt Rate (ED/Hospital)
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher average alcohol consumption creates chronic neurobiological changes affecting mood regulation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure disrupts serotonergic and GABAergic systems involved in emotional
  stability'
- 'Step 3: Regular consumption may mask or exacerbate underlying depression and anxiety disorders'
- 'Step 4: Dose-response relationship between alcohol volume and suicidal behavior risk'
- 'Step 5: Increased probability of suicide attempts requiring emergency or hospital care'

description: The protocol will examine average alcohol volume consumed as a key exposure dimension, providing
  risk estimates for suicide attempts stratified by gender and consumption level.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Average alcohol consumption is influenced by structural determinants including
    alcohol availability, pricing policies, advertising exposure, socioeconomic conditions, and cultural
    norms around drinking. Gender differences in risk relationships may reflect biological differences
    in alcohol metabolism, gendered social expectations, and differential exposure to alcohol-related
    social harms. The focus on quantitative consumption levels enables policy-relevant risk estimates.
