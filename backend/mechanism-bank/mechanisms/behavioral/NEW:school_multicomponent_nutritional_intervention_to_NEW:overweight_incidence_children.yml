direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multicomponent interventions implement coordinated changes across nutrition education, food
  service, and school policies'
- 'Step 2: Environmental modifications create default healthy options and reduce access to energy-dense,
  nutrient-poor foods'
- 'Step 3: Consistent exposure to healthy eating messages and environments during critical developmental
  periods shapes long-term dietary habits'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of new cases of overweight through sustained healthy weight trajectory during childhood
  and adolescence'

description: School-based multicomponent nutritional interventions reduce the incidence of new overweight
  cases among children and adolescents with an odds ratio of 0.67, representing a 33% reduction in new
  overweight cases compared to controls.

  equity_implications: By focusing on incidence prevention, this mechanism emphasizes primary prevention
    at the population level through environmental and policy changes rather than treatment of existing
    conditions. The school setting provides a structural lever for reaching children before unhealthy
    weight trajectories become established.
