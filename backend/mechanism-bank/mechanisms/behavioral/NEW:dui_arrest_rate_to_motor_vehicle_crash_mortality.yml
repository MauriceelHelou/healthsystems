description: The study frames DUI as a public health issue linked to significant traffic deaths and injuries.
  While the study does not directly measure mortality outcomes, it establishes the rationale that monitoring
  DUI trends is essential for evaluating prevention measures aimed at reducing traffic-related morbidity
  and mortality. The implied mechanism is that effective DUI enforcement and deterrence should lead to
  reduced alcohol-impaired driving and consequently fewer traffic fatalities.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism connects structural enforcement policies to population health outcomes
    (traffic mortality). The study appropriately identifies DUI as a public health issue requiring systematic
    intervention rather than individual-level approaches alone. The emphasis on using existing data sources
    for policy planning reflects a structural approach to addressing alcohol-related harm. Equity implications
    are not directly addressed in the abstract, though differential enforcement and its consequences by
    demographic groups remains an important structural consideration.
