- 'Step 1: Older adults develop attitudes toward technology based on prior experiences and exposure'
- 'Step 2: Positive attitudes including perceived usefulness and ease of use increase acceptance'
- 'Step 3: Technology anxiety and negative attitudes create psychological barriers to adoption'
- 'Step 4: Dispositional factors interact with technology design to determine adoption outcomes'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While dispositional factors appear individual-level, they are shaped by historical
    technology access patterns, education systems, and workplace technology exposure across lifecourse.
    Generational cohort effects reflect structural differences in technology integration across life stages.
