mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol consumption leads to direct hepatocyte damage through oxidative
  stress and metabolic toxicity'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species, causing
  hepatocellular injury and necrosis'
- 'Step 3: Damaged hepatocytes release intracellular ALT into the bloodstream, resulting
  in elevated serum ALT levels'

description: Heavy alcohol use causes direct hepatocellular damage through multiple
  pathways including oxidative stress, acetaldehyde toxicity, and metabolic disruption.
  This leads to hepatocyte necrosis and the release of intracellular ALT into the
  bloodstream, resulting in elevated serum ALT levels. The relationship shows a dose-response
  pattern, with heavier drinking associated with greater ALT elevation. The effect
  is consistent across different populations and shows improvement with alcohol cessation.
structural_competency_notes: Access to alcohol treatment programs and healthcare monitoring
  varies by socioeconomic status and geographic location. Cultural attitudes toward
  drinking, occupational factors, and social determinants of health influence both
  alcohol consumption patterns and healthcare seeking behavior for liver function
  monitoring.
