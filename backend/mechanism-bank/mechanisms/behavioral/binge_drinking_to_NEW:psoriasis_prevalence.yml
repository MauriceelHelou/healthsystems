  node_id: NEW:psoriasis_prevalence
  node_name: Psoriasis Prevalence
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol consumption (>45g/day, equivalent to 3.2 drinks) creates sustained metabolic
  and inflammatory burden'
- 'Step 2: Chronic heavy drinking impairs liver function and increases circulating inflammatory mediators'
- 'Step 3: Dose-dependent immune dysregulation accelerates T-cell mediated skin inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Higher alcohol doses produce more pronounced psoriatic disease manifestations'

description: Dose-response meta-analysis of 8 studies demonstrating that each additional gram of daily
  alcohol intake increases psoriasis odds by 4%. The association becomes more prominent at consumption
  levels exceeding 45g/day, establishing a clear dose-response gradient between alcohol consumption and
  psoriasis risk.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Heavy alcohol consumption patterns are not randomly distributed but cluster in
    communities experiencing economic deprivation, limited recreational opportunities, high alcohol outlet
    density, and weak alcohol control policies. Structural interventions targeting alcohol pricing, availability,
    and marketing can reduce population-level heavy consumption, potentially reducing alcohol-related
    inflammatory disease burden including psoriasis.
