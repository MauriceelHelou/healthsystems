mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Driver operates vehicle while THC-positive (detected through toxicological testing)'
- 'Step 2: Cannabis may impair divided attention, lane tracking, and decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Impairment increases likelihood of being at-fault in crash scenarios'
- 'Step 4: Culpability determination assigns responsibility for crash causation'

description: The pooled increased risk of a culpable crash for THC-positive drivers was estimated at 1.42
  (95% credibility interval 1.11-1.75), similar to traditional OR pooling (1.46, 95% CI 1.24-1.72). The
  study developed a Bayesian statistical model specifically for culpability study count data with hierarchical
  effects to account for heterogeneity across studies. This approach outperformed traditional culpability
  OR in bootstrap analyses.

  description: Bayesian hierarchical model produces similar culpable crash OR (1.42) to traditional methods
    (1.46), but reduces parameter uncertainty

  equity_implications: The distinction between culpable and total crash risk has policy implications.
    Culpability studies overrepresent at-fault crashes, and misinterpreting culpability ORs as total crash
    risk leads to 'interpretational bias' that exaggerates both risk increases and parameter uncertainty.
    This methodological insight is critical for evidence-based policy development around cannabis-impaired
    driving laws, which disproportionately affect certain populations through enforcement patterns.
