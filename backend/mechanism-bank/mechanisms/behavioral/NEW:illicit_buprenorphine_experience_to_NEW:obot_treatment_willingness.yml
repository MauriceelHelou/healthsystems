direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with OUD may obtain buprenorphine through illicit channels due to treatment access
  barriers'
- 'Step 2: Positive experiences with self-managed buprenorphine use demonstrate medication effectiveness'
- 'Step 3: These experiences increase openness to formal OBOT treatment settings'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced willingness facilitates engagement with structured medication treatment'

description: Prior positive experiences with illicitly obtained buprenorphine can serve as a facilitator
  for engagement with formal OBOT treatment, suggesting that treatment access barriers may paradoxically
  generate pathways to eventual formal treatment
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 23
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how structural barriers to treatment access (leading to
    illicit buprenorphine use) can indirectly facilitate future treatment engagement. This highlights
    the harm reduction potential of buprenorphine and the need for expanded access rather than criminalization.
