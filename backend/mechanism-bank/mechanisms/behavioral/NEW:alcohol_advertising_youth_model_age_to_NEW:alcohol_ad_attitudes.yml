- 'Step 1: Alcohol brands deploy younger-appearing models in social media advertisements'
- 'Step 2: Underage viewers perceive greater similarity and identification with younger models through
  social comparison processes'
- 'Step 3: Social cognitive theory predicts increased attention and favorable evaluation of messages from
  perceived in-group members'

description: Social media alcohol advertisements featuring younger-looking models generate more positive
  attitudes among underage youth viewers, as measured by advertising effectiveness self-report measures.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This pathway demonstrates how industry marketing practices shape youth attitudes
    toward alcohol consumption. The structural issue is the failure of self-regulatory frameworks to effectively
    prevent alcohol companies from targeting underage populations through strategic model selection. Policy
    recommendations include strengthening regulatory oversight of alcohol advertising content and platforms.
