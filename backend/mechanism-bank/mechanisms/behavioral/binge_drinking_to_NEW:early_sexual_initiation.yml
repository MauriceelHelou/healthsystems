mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and decision-making in adolescents and young adults'
- 'Step 2: Impaired executive function reduces ability to assess risk and consequences'
- 'Step 3: Social environments where alcohol is consumed often overlap with contexts facilitating sexual
  encounters'
- 'Step 4: Reduced inhibition leads to earlier initiation of sexual activity'

description: Alcohol consumption among adolescents and young adults nearly doubles the odds of early sexual
  initiation. This meta-analysis of 50 studies with over 465,000 participants demonstrates a strong association
  between alcohol use and premature sexual debut.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism involves individual behavior, the structural determinants
    include alcohol marketing to youth, availability of alcohol in communities, inadequate prevention
    programs, and lack of comprehensive sex education. The recommendation for drinking prevention programs
    supported by homes, schools, and communities acknowledges structural intervention needs. Equity implications
    include differential access to prevention resources and varying community-level alcohol availability.
