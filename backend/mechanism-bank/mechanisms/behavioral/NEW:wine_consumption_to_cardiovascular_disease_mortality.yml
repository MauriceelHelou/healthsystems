direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate wine consumption introduces polyphenolic compounds (resveratrol, flavonoids) into
  systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: These compounds exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on vascular endothelium'
- 'Step 3: Reduced oxidative stress and inflammation decrease atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression'
- 'Step 4: Improved vascular function and reduced thrombotic risk lower cardiovascular mortality'

description: 'Meta-analysis of 22 longitudinal studies found wine consumption inversely associated with
  cardiovascular mortality (RR=0.73, 95% CI: 0.59-0.90). This protective association was not modified
  by age, proportion of women, or follow-up time. Authors caution that increased wine intake may be harmful
  for individuals vulnerable to alcohol due to age, medication interactions, or pre-existing pathologies.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While this finding focuses on individual consumption patterns, structural factors
    shape access to and patterns of alcohol consumption including: socioeconomic status affecting wine
    affordability, cultural norms around alcohol consumption, marketing and availability of alcoholic
    beverages, and healthcare system capacity to identify individuals vulnerable to alcohol harms. The
    protective effect should not be used to recommend alcohol initiation, as vulnerable populations may
    experience harm. Health equity requires understanding that benefits and harms of alcohol are not equally
    distributed across populations.'
