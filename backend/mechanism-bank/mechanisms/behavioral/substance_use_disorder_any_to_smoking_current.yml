mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with substance use disorders have elevated smoking prevalence compared to general
  population'
- 'Step 2: Substance use treatment settings increasingly implement smoking bans during inpatient treatment'
- 'Step 3: Enforced abstinence during treatment does not address co-occurring nicotine addiction without
  dedicated cessation support'
- 'Step 4: Post-discharge from substance use treatment, individuals return to smoking without transition
  support'
- 'Step 5: Co-occurring nicotine addiction complicates substance use recovery and contributes to ongoing
  tobacco-related morbidity'

description: People with substance use disorders who experience smoking bans during inpatient treatment
  often relapse to smoking after discharge. The co-occurrence of nicotine addiction with other substance
  use disorders requires integrated treatment approaches rather than bans alone.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the need for healthcare systems to address nicotine addiction
    as part of comprehensive substance use treatment. The historical separation of tobacco treatment from
    other substance use treatment reflects structural gaps in healthcare delivery. Populations with substance
    use disorders face multiple structural disadvantages including stigma, poverty, and limited healthcare
    access that compound tobacco-related health risks.
