direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with opioid use disorder engage in chronic use of opioids,
  leading to physiological dependence and tolerance'
- 'Step 2: Continued opioid use results in multiple direct health consequences including
  respiratory depression, overdose risk, and organ damage'
- 'Step 3: Behavioral factors associated with OUD (injection drug use, risky behaviors)
  increase exposure to infectious diseases (HIV, hepatitis) and trauma'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative physiological harm, overdose events, infectious disease complications,
  and associated health conditions result in substantially elevated all-cause mortality
  rates'

description: Opioid use disorder is associated with a crude all-cause mortality rate
  of 18.7 per 1000 person-years, with overdose-specific mortality accounting for 7.0
  per 1000 person-years. This represents a substantially elevated mortality risk compared
  to the general population, driven by overdose events, injection-related complications,
  infectious diseases, and other health consequences of chronic opioid use.
