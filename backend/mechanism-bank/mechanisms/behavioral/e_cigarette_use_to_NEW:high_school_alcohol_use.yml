description: High school e-cigarette users showed an 8-fold increased odds of alcohol use compared to
  non-users, representing a stronger association than the overall adolescent population. This highlights
  the particular vulnerability of the high school age group.

  equity_implications: School environments represent key structural intervention points. Policies around
    school-based prevention programs, tobacco-free school policies, and age-verification enforcement are
    structural factors that shape exposure. The stronger association in high school suggests critical
    windows for prevention. Equity considerations include variation in school resources for prevention
    programming across socioeconomic contexts.
