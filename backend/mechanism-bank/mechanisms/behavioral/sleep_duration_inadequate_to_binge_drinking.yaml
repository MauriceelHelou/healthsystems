mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate sleep duration leads to difficulties initiating and maintaining
  sleep, creating chronic sleep deficits'
- 'Step 2: Sleep-deprived individuals seek coping strategies to manage sleep difficulties
  and associated stress'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol is used as a self-medication strategy and sleep aid due to its
  sedative properties'
- 'Step 4: Regular use of alcohol as a sleep aid can escalate to binge drinking patterns'
- 'Step 5: Alcohol further impairs sleep quality, creating a reinforcing cycle that
  promotes continued heavy drinking'

description: Inadequate sleep duration is associated with binge drinking through self-medication
  pathways. Individuals with insufficient sleep use alcohol as a sleep aid and coping
  mechanism for sleep-related stress. Six of fourteen studies in the systematic review
  found connections between sleep deprivation (particularly in shift workers) and
  increased alcohol consumption, especially binge drinking patterns. This creates
  a harmful cycle as alcohol further impairs sleep quality.
