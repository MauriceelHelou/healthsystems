mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Self-compassion provides internal psychological resources for coping with
  distress and negative emotions'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with greater self-compassion are less likely to engage in coping-motivated
  drinking as an avoidance strategy'
- 'Step 3: Reduced reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism decreases overall problem
  drinking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Self-compassion may buffer against depression and psychiatric distress
  that drive alcohol use'
