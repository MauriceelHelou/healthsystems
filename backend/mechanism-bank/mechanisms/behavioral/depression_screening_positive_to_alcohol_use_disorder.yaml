direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression screening positive indicates presence of depressive symptoms
  that create psychological distress and negative emotional states'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with depression use alcohol as a maladaptive coping mechanism
  to self-medicate negative emotions, anxiety, and psychological pain'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol use as self-medication leads to tolerance, dependence,
  and eventual development of alcohol use disorder, particularly in vulnerable populations'

description: Depression screening positive increases risk for alcohol use disorder
  through self-medication pathways, where individuals use alcohol to cope with depressive
  symptoms, negative emotions, and psychological distress. This relationship is consistently
  observed across diverse populations including college students, veterans, elderly
  individuals, and medical patients.
structural_competency_notes: Social determinants including poverty, unemployment,
  low education levels, and social isolation amplify both depression and problematic
  alcohol use. Gender differences exist, with males showing higher rates of alcohol
  use disorder but females showing stronger associations between depression and treatment
  non-adherence.
