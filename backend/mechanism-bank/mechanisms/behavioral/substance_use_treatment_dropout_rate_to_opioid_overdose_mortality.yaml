direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with opioid use disorder discontinue medication-assisted treatment
  (MAT) including methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone'
- 'Step 2: Upon treatment cessation, physiological opioid tolerance decreases significantly
  while the neurobiological craving and psychological dependence may persist'
- 'Step 3: Loss of protective pharmacological effects from MAT medications removes
  the blocking or stabilizing action against illicit opioid use'
- 'Step 4: Return to illicit opioid use occurs at pre-treatment doses that now exceed
  the individual''s reduced tolerance threshold'
- 'Step 5: The mismatch between reduced tolerance and resumed high-dose opioid consumption
  leads to respiratory depression and overdose death'

description: Treatment cessation from medication-assisted treatment substantially
  increases overdose mortality risk among individuals with opioid use disorder. This
  meta-analysis of 30 cohort studies found that after MAT cessation, the overdose
  crude mortality rate was 0.68 per 100 person-years compared to 0.24 while receiving
  treatment. Discharged participants had 3.09 times higher overdose death risk compared
  to those retained in treatment. The untreated period showed even higher risk with
  8.10 times greater overdose mortality compared to active treatment.
