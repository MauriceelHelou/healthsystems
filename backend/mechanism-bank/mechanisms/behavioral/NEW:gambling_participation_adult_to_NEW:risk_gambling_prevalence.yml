direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nearly half of adults globally (46.2%) engage in gambling activities'
- 'Step 2: Among those who gamble, a subset develops at-risk gambling behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Continued gambling exposure leads to risk gambling in 8.7% of adult population'
- 'Step 4: Risk gambling represents intermediate stage on spectrum toward problematic gambling'

description: The meta-analysis found that 8.7% (95% CI 6.6-11.3) of adults globally engage in any risk
  gambling, with 46.2% (95% CI 41.7-50.8) participating in any gambling activity in the past 12 months.
  This establishes the population-level burden of at-risk gambling behavior.

  description: Most samples were from high-income countries, suggesting potential underestimation of prevalence
    in lower-income settings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights gambling as a public health concern requiring population-level
    interventions rather than individual-focused approaches. The high prevalence of risk gambling suggests
    structural and environmental factors facilitate progression from casual to problematic gambling.
