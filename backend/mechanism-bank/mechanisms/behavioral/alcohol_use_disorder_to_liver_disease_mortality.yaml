- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption in AUD leads to direct hepatotoxicity
  through acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species generation'
- 'Step 2: Sustained alcohol exposure causes progressive liver damage including steatosis,
  steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis'
- 'Step 3: AUD accelerates liver disease progression, particularly in combination
  with other hepatic insults (e.g., HCV infection increases decompensation risk 3.3-fold)'
- 'Step 4: Decompensated cirrhosis leads to life-threatening complications including
  variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome'
- 'Step 5: Gastrointestinal/liver-related deaths represent the second most common
  cause of mortality in AUD populations (5.63/1000 person-years)'

description: Alcohol Use Disorder leads to liver disease mortality through direct
  hepatotoxic effects of chronic alcohol consumption causing progressive liver damage.
  The pathway proceeds from steatosis through steatohepatitis and fibrosis to cirrhosis
  and its life-threatening complications. Gastrointestinal/liver-related deaths occur
  at a rate of 5.63/1000 person-years in AUD populations, making it the second most
  common cause of death after cardiovascular disease. The association is particularly
  strong in those with HCV co-infection (3.3-fold increased risk of decompensation).
  In alcohol-problem cohorts, 7-16% develop alcoholic liver cirrhosis within 8-12
  years. Approximately 40% of alcoholic liver cirrhosis patients had prior alcohol-related
  healthcare contacts, representing prevention opportunities. Treatment with medications
  for AUD can reduce mortality by 20% in cirrhosis patients.
