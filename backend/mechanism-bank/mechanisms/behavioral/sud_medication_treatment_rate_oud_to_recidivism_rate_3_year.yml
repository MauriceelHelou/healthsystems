  to probation requirements, and engage in behavioral therapy, ultimately reducing recidivism rates.

  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare access within the criminal justice system
    can interrupt cycles of incarceration. Structural barriers to treatment perpetuate the revolving door
    of criminal justice involvement, disproportionately affecting communities with high rates of substance
    use disorder and criminal justice contact.
