  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- PTSD symptoms create psychological distress, hyperarousal, trauma-related intrusions,
  and negative alterations in cognition and mood
- Individuals use alcohol as a coping mechanism to self-medicate and reduce PTSD symptoms,
  particularly to manage hyperarousal, intrusive symptoms, and negative affect
- Repeated alcohol use for symptom management leads to tolerance, dependence, and
  the development of alcohol use disorder, creating a bidirectional relationship where
  alcohol use may worsen PTSD symptoms over time

description: PTSD prevalence leads to increased alcohol use disorder through a self-medication
  pathway where individuals use alcohol to cope with trauma-related symptoms including
  hyperarousal, intrusive thoughts, and negative mood states. Network analyses show
  trauma-related intrusions and alcohol-related social impairment serve as bridging
  symptom clusters connecting PTSD and AUD. The relationship is bidirectional, with
  alcohol use potentially worsening PTSD symptoms over time, creating a cycle of comorbidity.
structural_competency_notes: Access to mental health services, stigma around seeking
  treatment (particularly in military/veteran populations), availability of evidence-based
  PTSD treatments, and social environments that normalize alcohol use as coping mechanisms
  all influence this pathway. Socioeconomic factors affecting treatment access and
  cultural attitudes toward mental health care modify the strength of this relationship.
