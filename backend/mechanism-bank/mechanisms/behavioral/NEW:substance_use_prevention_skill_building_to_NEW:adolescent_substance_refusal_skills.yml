description: The comprehensive social-influence approach of the YSLQQ program builds protective skills

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that individual resistance to substance use requires
    structural support through educational programming. Rather than expecting adolescents to develop refusal
    skills independently, the school-based system provides equitable access to skill development. This
    addresses structural inequity by ensuring students in public schools receive evidence-based prevention
    programming.
