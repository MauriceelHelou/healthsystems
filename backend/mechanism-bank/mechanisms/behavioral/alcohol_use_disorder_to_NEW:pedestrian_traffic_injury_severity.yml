direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ethyl alcohol consumption impairs cognitive function and situational awareness in pedestrians'
- 'Step 2: Intoxicated pedestrians exhibit reduced ability to avoid or respond to oncoming vehicles'
- 'Step 3: Impaired protective reflexes lead to inability to brace for impact or minimize trauma'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-induced physiological changes may affect tissue vulnerability and bleeding risk'
- 'Step 5: Higher blood alcohol concentrations correlate with more severe injuries as measured by injury
  severity scales (LTI, ICISS)'

description: Higher blood alcohol concentration is associated with more severe injuries in fatal pedestrian
  traffic crashes, with the effect particularly pronounced in women. The study found that as alcohol concentration
  increases, injury severity measures (LTI, ICISS-10, ICISS-15) show lower values indicating more severe
  injuries. Gender and age significantly influence injury severity assessment.

  description: As alcohol concentration increases in women, injury severity indices (LTI, ICISS-10, ICISS-15)
    indicate more severe injuries; injuries are significantly heavier in women than in men across ISS
    and NISS scales

  strength: moderate
  description: Older victims die from milder injuries according to all scales used, suggesting age-related
    vulnerability rather than alcohol interaction with severity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While this study focuses on individual-level alcohol consumption, the structural
    determinants include: availability of alcohol through outlet density policies, inadequate pedestrian
    infrastructure that fails to protect intoxicated individuals, lack of safe transportation alternatives
    (public transit, ride-sharing) that reduce need for walking while intoxicated, and gender-based differences
    that may reflect differential access to protective resources. The finding that women experience more
    severe injuries points to potential structural inequities in road safety design and emergency response
    systems.'
