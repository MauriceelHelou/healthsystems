direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adolescents perceive injunctive norms regarding menthol cigarette smoking (beliefs about social
  approval)'
- 'Step 2: When menthol products are removed, counterintuitively, perceptions may shift to suggest forbidden/restricted
  status'
- 'Step 3: Reactance or curiosity may develop in response to perceived restriction'
- 'Step 4: Intentions to smoke menthol cigarettes may paradoxically increase'

description: Injunctive norms mediate the relationship between menthol cigarette display removal and INCREASED
  intentions to smoke menthol cigarettes, representing a potential unintended consequence of menthol ban
  policies.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding reveals a critical unintended consequence of structural tobacco control
    policy. While menthol bans are designed to reduce youth smoking, the mediation through injunctive
    norms suggests the policy may paradoxically increase intentions through psychological mechanisms.
    This has significant equity implications given that menthol tobacco products are disproportionately
    marketed to and used by Black communities, making policy design particularly important.
