category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women with alcohol and/or other psychoactive substance use disorders have extremely high co-occurring
  tobacco use (71-95% prevalence)'
- 'Step 2: Polysubstance use creates neurobiological reinforcement patterns that maintain nicotine dependence'
- 'Step 3: Existing cessation interventions are not specifically designed for this population with complex
  needs'
- 'Step 4: Limited evidence-based treatments targeting co-occurring substance use reduce cessation success'
- 'Step 5: High rates of continued smoking during pregnancy persist in this disadvantaged population'

description: Women with co-occurring alcohol and/or other psychoactive substance use disorders during
  pregnancy have exceptionally high rates of tobacco smoking (71-95%), yet few successfully quit smoking
  due to limited availability of cessation interventions specifically designed for populations with polysubstance
  use patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural gaps in the healthcare and treatment system
    that fail to address the needs of multiply-disadvantaged pregnant women. The lack of targeted interventions
    for co-occurring substance use represents a system-level failure rather than individual moral failing.
    These women face compounded structural barriers including stigma, lack of integrated treatment programs,
    and healthcare systems not designed for complex presentations. The high prevalence of tobacco use
    in this group reflects socioeconomic disadvantage and inadequate policy attention to developing evidence-based
    interventions for marginalized populations.
