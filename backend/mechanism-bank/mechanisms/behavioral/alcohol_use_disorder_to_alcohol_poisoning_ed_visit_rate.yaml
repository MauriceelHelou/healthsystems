direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with alcohol use disorder exhibit patterns of heavy, frequent,
  and problematic alcohol consumption with impaired control over drinking behavior'
- 'Step 2: These consumption patterns increase the likelihood of consuming toxic amounts
  of alcohol, leading to acute alcohol intoxication and poisoning episodes'
- 'Step 3: Acute alcohol poisoning requires emergency medical intervention, resulting
  in increased ED visits specifically for alcohol poisoning among those with AUD'

description: 'Alcohol use disorder creates a direct pathway to increased alcohol poisoning
  ED visits through the fundamental characteristic of AUD: impaired control over alcohol
  consumption leading to heavy drinking patterns. Individuals with AUD demonstrate
  significantly higher rates of acute alcohol intoxication presentations compared
  to those with episodic drinking, with latent class analysis revealing distinct severity
  gradients from low-frequency acute intoxication visits to high-frequency AUD-related
  presentations. The mechanism operates through the core pathophysiology of AUD, where
  tolerance development and loss of behavioral control result in consumption of potentially
  toxic alcohol amounts.'
structural_competency_notes: Structural factors including homelessness, lack of access
  to addiction treatment services, and limited mental health resources contribute
  to the cyclical nature of this pathway. Individuals with AUD and co-occurring conditions
  like substance use disorders show even higher rates of ED utilization, suggesting
  that social determinants and healthcare access barriers amplify the relationship
  between AUD and acute alcohol poisoning presentations.
