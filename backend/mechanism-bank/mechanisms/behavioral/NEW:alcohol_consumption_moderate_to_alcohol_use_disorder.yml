direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Even moderate regular alcohol consumption initiates neuroadaptive tolerance mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Regular drinking establishes behavioral patterns and psychological associations with alcohol
  use'
- 'Step 3: Gradual escalation of consumption may occur as tolerance develops'
- 'Step 4: Subthreshold symptoms of dependence emerge before clinical AUD criteria are met'

description: Even at moderate consumption levels of 20g/day (approximately one large beer), the risk of
  developing alcohol use disorder is nearly threefold that of current non-drinkers, demonstrating that
  elevated risk begins at relatively low consumption levels.

  variation_notes: Studies from high-income countries and Brazil; standard drink definitions vary internationally
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Social norms around 'moderate' drinking are shaped by cultural factors, alcohol
    industry marketing, and policy environments. What is considered socially acceptable drinking varies
    by community and is influenced by structural factors including advertising exposure and alcohol outlet
    availability. Public health messaging about 'safe' drinking levels has been challenged by evidence
    of harm at lower thresholds.
