direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals adopt manner of drinking strategies (a PBS subscale) including drinking slowly,
  spacing drinks over time'
- 'Step 2: These strategies directly reduce the rate of alcohol consumption per hour'
- 'Step 3: Slower consumption allows for better self-monitoring of intoxication levels'
- 'Step 4: Reduced consumption rate decreases total alcohol intake per occasion below binge thresholds'

description: The systematic review specifically notes that effects varied across PBS subscale types, with
  manner of drinking mentioned as a key dimension. While most subscale analyses showed protective effects
  (73% for heavy use, 78% for consequences), the variation suggests that specific strategy types may be
  more effective in certain contexts.

  description: Manner of drinking was specifically noted as a subscale where effects varied; suggests
    context-dependent effectiveness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Manner of drinking strategies are influenced by drinking environment characteristics
    - social norms, drinking game prevalence, bar serving practices, and peer pressure. Structural interventions
    should target these environmental factors rather than expecting individuals to resist contextual pressures
    alone. Policies regulating serving sizes, drink specials, and venue practices can support individual
    strategy implementation.
