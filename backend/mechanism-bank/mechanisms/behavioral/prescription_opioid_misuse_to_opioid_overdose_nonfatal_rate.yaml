mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) involves taking opioids without
  a prescription, in higher doses than prescribed, or for non-medical purposes (e.g.,
  euphoria)'
- 'Step 2: NMPOU leads to opioid tolerance, requiring escalating doses to achieve
  desired effects, increasing risk of respiratory depression'
- 'Step 3: Without medical supervision, users lack knowledge of safe dosing thresholds,
  potency variations, and drug interaction risks'
- 'Step 4: Users may combine prescription opioids with other CNS depressants (alcohol,
  benzodiazepines) further increasing overdose risk'
- 'Step 5: Acute opioid toxicity results in respiratory depression, hypoxia, and other
  life-threatening complications constituting non-fatal overdose'

description: A large systematic review of 182 studies found strong evidence for associations
  between non-medical prescription opioid use and both fatal and non-fatal overdose.
  The review identified this as one of the most well-established health harms of NMPOU,
  within the domain of mental and behavioral disorders. The mechanism involves escalating
  use patterns, tolerance development, unsafe dosing practices, and potential polysubstance
  use leading to acute opioid toxicity and overdose events.
