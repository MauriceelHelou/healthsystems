- 'Step 1: Comorbid substance use disorder commonly co-occurs with PTSD as self-medication'
- 'Step 2: Active substance use impairs fear extinction learning processes central to trauma therapy'
- 'Step 3: Substance use interferes with emotional processing and memory consolidation'
- 'Step 4: Dual disorders require integrated treatment approaches not captured in standard T-F protocols'
- 'Step 5: Treatment dropout or incomplete engagement reduces therapeutic benefit'

  description: Alcohol use disorder as common PTSD comorbidity may particularly impair treatment response
    through effects on memory consolidation and emotional regulation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The PTSD-SUD comorbidity reflects structural determinants including trauma exposure
    concentrated in disadvantaged communities, limited access to integrated dual-diagnosis treatment,
    and alcohol outlet density in high-poverty areas. Treatment systems often silo mental health and substance
    use care, disadvantaging those with co-occurring disorders. Structural barriers to integrated care
    perpetuate poor outcomes.
