category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Kratom produces both opioid and stimulant-like effects through multiple receptor systems'
- 'Step 2: This dual pharmacology may address cravings for multiple substance classes simultaneously'
- 'Step 3: Limited treatment options exist for polysubstance use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Kratom may serve as harm reduction agent for complex polysubstance patterns'

  description: More complex polysubstance use patterns may benefit from kratom's multi-target pharmacology
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment options for polysubstance use disorder remain limited, reflecting a structural
    gap in pharmaceutical development and healthcare system response to the complexity of substance use
    patterns. This is a systemic failure, not individual pathology.
