- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption increases HDL cholesterol levels'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol may reduce fibrinogen and platelet aggregation'
- 'Step 3: Polyphenols in certain alcoholic beverages (wine) may provide antioxidant effects'
- 'Step 4: These mechanisms may reduce cardiovascular disease mortality risk in breast cancer patients'

description: Alcohol consumption was associated with significantly decreased cardiovascular disease mortality
  in breast cancer patients (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.28-0.79, p=0.005) based on 2 studies. However, limited
  study count warrants caution in interpretation.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this association appears strong statistically, it is based on only 2 studies.
    The finding aligns with broader literature on moderate alcohol and cardiovascular outcomes but should
    not override clinical guidance given alcohol's carcinogenic properties. Structural policies should
    continue to focus on cancer prevention through alcohol control.
