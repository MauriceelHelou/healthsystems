- 'Step 1: Craving triggered by NoLo drink consumption in individuals with AUD'

description: Increased craving from NoLo drink exposure may contribute to relapse risk and maintenance
  of alcohol use disorder, particularly in those with more severe dependence.

  equity_implications: This mechanism has implications for clinical guidance and treatment protocols.
    Healthcare systems and clinicians need evidence-based recommendations about NoLo drinks for patients
    with AUD. The paper explicitly calls for studies to guide clinicians, patients, and stakeholders in
    evidence-based decisions - highlighting the need for structural support rather than leaving individuals
    to navigate this alone.
