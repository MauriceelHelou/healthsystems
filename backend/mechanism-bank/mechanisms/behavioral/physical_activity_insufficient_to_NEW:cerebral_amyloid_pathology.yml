direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low physical activity reduces cerebral blood flow and vascular health'
- 'Step 2: Decreased vascular function impairs delivery of nutrients and clearance of waste products'
- 'Step 3: Sedentary behavior associated with reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)'
- 'Step 4: Combined vascular and neurotrophic deficits promote amyloid accumulation'

description: Physical activity levels are examined as a lifestyle factor associated with cerebral amyloid
  pathology, with insufficient activity potentially increasing AD-related neuropathology.

  equity_implications: Physical activity is structurally constrained by built environment (sidewalk availability,
    park access, safety), time poverty from employment demands, and neighborhood walkability. Investments
    in active transportation infrastructure and green space represent structural interventions.
