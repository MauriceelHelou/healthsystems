- 'Step 1: Open bar parties provide unlimited alcohol for a flat fee, incentivizing maximum consumption'
- 'Step 2: Economic structure of flat-fee pricing removes per-drink cost barriers'
- 'Step 3: Social environment at these events normalizes heavy drinking among peers'
- 'Step 4: Lack of regulatory enforcement allows minors access to unlimited alcohol'
- 'Step 5: Youth engage in binge drinking patterns at these events'

description: Attendance at open bar parties is strongly associated with binge drinking among early adolescents,
  driven by the structural incentive of unlimited alcohol consumption for a fixed price
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 5213
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism traces to policy failure in enforcing bans on selling alcohol to
    minors. The pricing structure of open bar events creates economic incentives for overconsumption.
    This is a commercial determinant of health issue, not individual moral failing.
