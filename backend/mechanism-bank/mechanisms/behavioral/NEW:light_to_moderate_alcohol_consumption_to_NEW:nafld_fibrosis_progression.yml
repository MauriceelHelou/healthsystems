direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption (below heavy drinking threshold) in individuals with
  NAFLD'
- 'Step 2: Potential protective effects through mechanisms such as improved insulin sensitivity or anti-inflammatory
  properties at low doses'
- 'Step 3: Reduced progression from simple steatosis to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of histological fibrosis progression in NAFLD patients'

description: This meta-analysis examines the impact of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption on progressive
  non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, investigating whether low levels of alcohol intake affect fibrosis
  progression and mortality outcomes in NAFLD patients.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on individual alcohol consumption patterns, structural
    factors influence drinking behaviors including alcohol availability, pricing policies, social norms,
    and marketing. NAFLD prevalence itself is shaped by food environments, economic factors affecting
    diet quality, and access to healthcare for metabolic disease management. The definition of 'light-to-moderate'
    drinking may vary across populations and cultures, and access to information about safe drinking levels
    is unequally distributed.
