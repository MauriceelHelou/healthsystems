direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption elevates blood alcohol concentration (BAC)'
- 'Step 2: BAC impairs neurological function affecting judgment, reaction time, and coordination'
- 'Step 3: Impaired driving increases probability and severity of crashes'
- 'Step 4: Crash involvement results in injuries ranging from minor to severe'

description: The meta-analysis confirms that elevated BAC increases motor vehicle crash injury risk following
  an exponential dose-response pattern. The 393 effect estimates from 60 studies demonstrate that this
  relationship holds across multiple study designs and geographic regions, with heterogeneity explained
  by BAC level, outcome severity, data source, and geography.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects vary by geographic region with stronger associations observed in Nordic countries
    compared to other regions
moderators:
- name: BAC level
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Exponential relationship between BAC and injury risk - higher BAC produces disproportionately
    greater injury risk
- name: Injury severity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The association is stronger for more severe injury outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Structural determinants influence both alcohol consumption patterns and crash injury
    risk. Low-income communities may have higher alcohol outlet density, fewer safe transportation alternatives,
    and less access to rideshare services. Policy interventions at the structural level (sobriety checkpoints,
    BAC limit laws, ignition interlock requirements) can reduce population-level risk. The geographic
    variation observed suggests policy environments and infrastructure differences moderate this relationship.
