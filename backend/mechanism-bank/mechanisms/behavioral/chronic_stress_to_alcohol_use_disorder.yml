direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Older adults (50+) experience accumulated life stressors and chronic stress'
- 'Step 2: Stress activates physiological and psychological coping responses'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol may be used as a maladaptive coping mechanism for stress relief'
- 'Step 4: Repeated use for stress management leads to increased tolerance and dependence'
- 'Step 5: Development of late-onset alcohol use disorder or heavy drinking patterns'

description: Systematic review finding that stress is associated with increased risk for late-onset alcohol
  use disorder or heavy drinking in adults aged 50 and older. The review notes limited evidence overall
  but stress emerged as a consistent risk factor.

  description: Focus specifically on late-onset (50+) AUD, suggesting age-specific vulnerability to stress-related
    drinking
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Stress as a risk factor has structural roots including economic insecurity, social
    isolation, and lack of supportive services for older adults. The mechanism avoids individual blame
    by recognizing stress as a structural exposure. Equity implications include differential exposure
    to chronic stressors based on socioeconomic status, race, and access to resources in later life.
