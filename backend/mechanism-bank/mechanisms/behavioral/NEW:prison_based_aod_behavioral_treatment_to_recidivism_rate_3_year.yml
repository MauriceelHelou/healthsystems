mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incarcerated men with histories of alcohol and other drug (AoD) use receive structured behavioral
  treatment programs within prison settings'
- 'Step 2: Treatment programs address the substance use behaviors that are often linked to the crimes
  for which individuals are imprisoned'
- 'Step 3: Behavioral interventions modify substance use patterns and associated criminal behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Upon release, reduced substance use decreases likelihood of reoffending and subsequent reincarceration'

description: This systematic review examines prison-based behavioral treatment programs for alcohol and
  other drug use among incarcerated men, assessing their effectiveness in reducing substance use and related
  outcomes including recidivism. The review is notable as the first in over a decade to comprehensively
  evaluate methodological quality of such evaluations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism acknowledges the structural context of incarceration and substance
    use linkage. The high prevalence of AoD use histories among incarcerated men reflects broader structural
    determinants including socioeconomic disadvantage, limited treatment access in communities, and criminalization
    of substance use. Prison-based treatment represents an institutional response to substance use disorders,
    though it occurs within a punitive rather than public health framework. Equity implications include
    the disproportionate incarceration of marginalized populations and the structural barriers to treatment
    access that precede incarceration.
