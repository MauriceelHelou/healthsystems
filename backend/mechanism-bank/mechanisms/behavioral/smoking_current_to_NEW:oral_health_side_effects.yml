direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Combustible cigarette smoking exposes oral tissues to tobacco combustion products including
  tar, carbon monoxide, and thousands of chemicals'
- 'Step 2: Combustion products cause direct tissue damage, reduced blood flow, and impaired immune function
  in oral cavity'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure results in higher rates of oral side effects compared to non-combustible alternatives'
- 'Step 4: NCNPs serve as comparator with potentially reduced oral health harms relative to combustible
  smoking'

description: The protocol positions combustible cigarette smoking as the reference exposure against which
  non-combustible nicotine products will be compared, based on the premise that NCNPs are less harmful
  than tobacco smoking though their specific oral health impacts remain unclear.

    effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Framing NCNPs as harm reduction for those 'unable or unwilling to quit' acknowledges
    structural barriers to smoking cessation including addiction, stress from socioeconomic conditions,
    and limited access to cessation resources. The comparative effectiveness framework can inform harm
    reduction policies that meet people where they are rather than solely emphasizing abstinence.
