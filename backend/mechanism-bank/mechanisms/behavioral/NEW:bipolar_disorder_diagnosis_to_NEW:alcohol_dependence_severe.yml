direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bipolar disorder involves chronic relapsing course requiring ongoing mental health treatment'
- 'Step 2: Gaps in mental health service availability and continuity create periods of unmanaged symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Sustained alcohol use as coping mechanism leads to physiological dependence'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol dependence develops in 15.87% of bipolar population, indicating progression beyond
  abuse to severe disorder'

  more severe form of AUD), indicating that a substantial minority progress to physiological dependence
  requiring intensive treatment interventions.

  equity_implications: 'The 15.87% alcohol dependence rate among bipolar patients represents a severe
    outcome that reflects accumulated structural failures including: inadequate mental health treatment
    access, lack of early intervention services, insufficient integration between psychiatric and addiction
    medicine, and barriers to sustained recovery support services.'
