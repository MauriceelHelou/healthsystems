description: Low-certainty evidence suggests people randomized to ONP may be slightly less likely to quit
  smoking than those randomized to e-cigarettes, indicating ONP may be less effective as a cessation tool
  compared to vaping products

  description: E-cigarettes may be more effective than ONP for smoking cessation (ONP showed lower abstinence
    rates compared to e-cigarettes)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Differential effectiveness of harm reduction products has policy implications for
    tobacco control strategies. If e-cigarettes are more effective, regulatory frameworks that restrict
    e-cigarettes while permitting ONP may not optimize population health outcomes. Market availability
    and regulatory stringency represent structural determinants of cessation success.
