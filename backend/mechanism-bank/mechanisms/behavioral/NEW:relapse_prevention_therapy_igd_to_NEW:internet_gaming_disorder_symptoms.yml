description: Relapse prevention therapy based on cognitive behavioral treatment, delivered through child
  and adolescent psychiatric clinics, reduces internet gaming disorder symptoms more effectively than
  treatment as usual. The treatment group showed a mean GASA score reduction of 8.7 points compared to
  5.1 points in the control group at 3-month follow-up.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare access and availability of specialized behavioral
    health services for adolescents. The study highlights the importance of having structured treatment
    protocols available within existing child and adolescent psychiatric infrastructure. The RCT design
    in public healthcare settings (Region Skåne, Sweden) demonstrates how healthcare system capacity to
    deliver evidence-based interventions affects behavioral health outcomes. Equity implications include
    ensuring such treatments are accessible across different socioeconomic groups within universal healthcare
    systems.
