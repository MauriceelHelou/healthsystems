- 'Step 1: Individuals experiencing psychological distress, trauma-related symptoms,
  or anxiety use alcohol as a maladaptive coping mechanism to self-medicate these
  symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Repeated use of alcohol for self-medication purposes establishes patterns
  of drinking to cope, creating psychological dependence and tolerance'
- 'Step 3: Continued self-medication behavior escalates into problematic drinking
  patterns that meet criteria for alcohol use disorder diagnosis'

description: Self-medication behavior represents a maladaptive coping strategy where
  individuals use alcohol to manage psychological distress, anxiety, trauma symptoms,
  or other negative emotional states. This coping mechanism creates a reinforcing
  cycle where temporary symptom relief from alcohol use leads to repeated self-medication
  attempts. Over time, this pattern of drinking to cope establishes tolerance, psychological
  dependence, and escalating alcohol consumption that progresses to meet diagnostic
  criteria for alcohol use disorder. The self-medication pathway is particularly robust
  for trauma-related symptoms, anxiety disorders, and depression, with longitudinal
  studies consistently demonstrating that self-medication drinking predicts both incident
  and persistent alcohol dependence.
structural_competency_notes: Structural factors such as limited access to mental health
  services, stigma around help-seeking, economic stressors, and social isolation can
  increase reliance on self-medication behaviors. Additionally, cultural norms that
  normalize alcohol use for coping, along with systemic inequities that create higher
  exposure to trauma and chronic stress, disproportionately affect marginalized populations
  and increase vulnerability to self-medication pathways leading to alcohol use disorder.
