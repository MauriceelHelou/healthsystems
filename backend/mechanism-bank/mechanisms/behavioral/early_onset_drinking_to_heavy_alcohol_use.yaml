  node_id: heavy_alcohol_use

direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol initiation before age 15 occurs during critical periods of brain
  development, particularly in frontostriatal circuits that mediate inhibitory control'
- 'Step 2: Early exposure leads to reduced white matter integrity and impaired executive
  control development, creating neurobiological vulnerabilities that persist into
  adulthood'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes, combined with earlier exposure to alcohol''s
  reinforcing effects, result in accelerated progression to hazardous drinking patterns
  and increased likelihood of heavy alcohol use in young adulthood'

description: Early onset drinking before age 15 creates a causal pathway to heavy
  alcohol use through neurobiological vulnerabilities established during critical
  developmental periods. The mechanism involves impaired development of executive
  control systems and reduced white matter integrity, which persists into adulthood
  and creates predisposition for accelerated progression to hazardous drinking patterns.
structural_competency_notes: This pathway is influenced by structural factors including
  socioeconomic status, family context, and community-level alcohol availability policies
  that determine access to alcohol during early adolescence. Prevention efforts must
  address both individual risk factors and broader structural determinants that facilitate
  underage alcohol access.
