- 'Step 1: Young people exposed to alcohol brand imagery near schools and playgrounds'
- 'Step 2: Brand familiarity develops before legal drinking age'
- 'Step 3: Normalized perception of alcohol reduces perceived risk'

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how corporate marketing strategies create environmental
    exposures that affect youth regardless of family or individual protective factors. The structural
    issue is regulatory failure to protect young people from alcohol marketing in their daily environments.
