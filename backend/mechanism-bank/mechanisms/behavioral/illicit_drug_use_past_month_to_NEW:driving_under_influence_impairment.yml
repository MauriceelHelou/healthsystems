- 'Step 1: OAT clients using illicit substances in addition to treatment medications face cumulative impairment
  effects'
- 'Step 2: 86.5% of clients reported using sedating medications or illicit drugs in the past month'
- 'Step 3: Combined substance use increases cognitive and motor impairment affecting driving ability'
- 'Step 4: Clients with past month illicit drug use showed 6.55 times higher odds of driving while impaired'

description: Among OAT clients, concurrent illicit drug use significantly increases the likelihood of
  driving under the influence. This reflects the complexity of addiction treatment where polysubstance
  use remains common.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this appears behavioral, it reflects structural issues including inadequate
    harm reduction services, limited treatment options for polysubstance use, and transportation systems
    that force reliance on personal vehicles. Treatment systems need to address transport barriers rather
    than expecting abstinence-based compliance.
