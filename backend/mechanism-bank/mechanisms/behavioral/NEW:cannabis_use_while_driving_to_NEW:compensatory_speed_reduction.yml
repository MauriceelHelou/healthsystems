direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis users may have some awareness of impairment'
- 'Step 2: Compensatory behavior manifests as reduced driving speed (g=-0.176)'
- 'Step 3: Speed reduction partially offsets but does not eliminate crash risk from lateral control deficits'
- 'Step 4: Net effect remains increased crash probability despite compensation'

description: Cannabis-impaired drivers tend to reduce their driving speed (g=-0.176), representing a compensatory
  behavior that partially but incompletely mitigates crash risk. This contrasts with alcohol where speed
  increases may occur.

  equity_implications: Understanding compensatory behaviors has implications for road design and speed
    limit policies. However, reliance on driver compensation should not be used to minimize the need for
    structural interventions such as improved public transit and ride-sharing accessibility.
