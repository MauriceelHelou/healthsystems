direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol and its metabolite acetaldehyde are directly toxic to testicular tissue'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol induces oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in reproductive organs'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol disrupts Sertoli cell function essential for sperm maturation'
- 'Step 4: Both quality (morphology) and quantity (concentration, volume) of semen are impaired'

    parameters
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol consumption patterns are shaped by structural determinants including alcohol
    outlet density in low-income neighborhoods, alcohol industry marketing targeting vulnerable populations,
    lack of accessible treatment services, and economic stress driving self-medication. The alcohol policy
    environment (taxation, availability regulations) creates differential exposure by socioeconomic status,
    contributing to reproductive health disparities.
