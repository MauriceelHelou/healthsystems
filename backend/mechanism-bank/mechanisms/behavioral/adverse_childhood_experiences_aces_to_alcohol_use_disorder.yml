- 'Step 1: Early life trauma and adverse childhood experiences create vulnerability to PTSD development'
- 'Step 2: PTSD symptoms emerging from ACEs produce chronic psychological distress'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to mental health services and trauma-informed care leaves symptoms untreated'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol becomes accessible self-medication tool for managing trauma-related symptoms'
- 'Step 5: Pattern of drinking to cope establishes pathway to alcohol use disorder'

description: This mechanism links early life adversity through PTSD development to alcohol use disorder
  via self-medication. The systematic review identifies multiple etiological models including shared genetic
  risk and phenotypic causality, with self-medication being the dominant explanatory framework.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: ACEs are not randomly distributed - they concentrate in communities experiencing
    poverty, discrimination, housing instability, and other structural disadvantages. The pathway from
    ACEs to PTSD to AUD reflects failures of social protection systems, inadequate mental health infrastructure,
    and the downstream health consequences of structural inequity. Prevention requires addressing root
    causes of childhood adversity through policy interventions targeting poverty, housing stability, and
    community violence.
