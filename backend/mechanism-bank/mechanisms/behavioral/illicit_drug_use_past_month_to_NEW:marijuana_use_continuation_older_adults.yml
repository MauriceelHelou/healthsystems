direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Older adults using other illicit drugs have established polysubstance use patterns'
- 'Step 2: Social networks and access channels for illicit substances facilitate continued marijuana access'
- 'Step 3: Shared risk factors and contexts for multiple substance use reinforce marijuana continuation'
- 'Step 4: Other illicit drug use reduces likelihood of transitioning from marijuana use to nonuse'

description: Other illicit drug use was associated with a lower likelihood of use-to-nonuse compared to
  continued marijuana use among older adults, indicating polysubstance use patterns support sustained
  marijuana use.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This reflects structural drivers of polysubstance use including inadequate treatment
    systems, criminalization rather than public health approaches, and social determinants creating vulnerability
    to substance use disorders.
