  node_name: Binge Drinking Prevalence
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals develop positive beliefs and expectations about alcohol''s
  effects on enhancement, socialization, and coping with distress'
- 'Step 2: These positive expectancies motivate alcohol use by creating anticipation
  of pleasurable outcomes and social benefits'
- 'Step 3: Stronger endorsement of positive alcohol expectancies leads to increased
  frequency and intensity of heavy episodic drinking behaviors'

description: Positive alcohol expectancies create cognitive frameworks that predispose
  individuals to heavy episodic drinking by establishing beliefs about alcohol's beneficial
  effects on mood enhancement, social facilitation, and stress coping. These expectancies
  serve as motivational drivers that increase the likelihood and frequency of binge
  drinking episodes.
structural_competency_notes: Social and cultural contexts shape the development of
  positive alcohol expectancies through peer influences, media representations, and
  cultural norms around drinking, which then interact with individual psychological
  factors to influence binge drinking patterns.
