mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with any substance use disorder share genetic variants that
  increase vulnerability to addictive behaviors, including those affecting dopaminergic
  reward pathways and impulse control circuits'
- 'Step 2: Shared genetic architecture creates cross-substance liability - genetic
  risk factors for substance use disorders are largely non-specific and predispose
  to multiple substance dependencies'
- 'Step 3: Behavioral patterns established through one substance use disorder (e.g.,
  using substances to cope, tolerance to intoxication, social environments) facilitate
  transition to or co-occurrence of alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Mendelian randomization evidence supports causal effects of substance use
  on liability to problematic alcohol use, indicating that substance use behaviors
  causally increase alcohol use disorder risk'

description: This genome-wide meta-analysis combining data from the Million Veteran
  Program, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and UK Biobank demonstrates strong genetic
  correlations between problematic alcohol use and other substance use traits. The
  study identified that PAU was genetically correlated with 138 phenotypes including
  substance use and psychiatric traits. Mendelian randomization analyses provided
  evidence for causal effects of substance use on liability to problematic alcohol
  use, supporting a behavioral pathway from general substance use disorder to alcohol
  use disorder. The shared genetic architecture and causal relationships suggest that
  substance use disorders increase risk for alcohol use disorder through both genetic
  predisposition and behavioral mechanisms.
