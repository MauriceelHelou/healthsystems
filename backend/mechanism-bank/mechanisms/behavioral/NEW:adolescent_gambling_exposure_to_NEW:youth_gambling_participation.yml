description: The review found 17.9% (95% CI 14.8-21.2) of adolescents had gambled in the past 12 months,
  with limited data on risk and problematic gambling in this age group. This identifies youth gambling
  as an emerging public health concern requiring attention.

  description: Few data reported on risk and problematic gambling among adolescents, suggesting potential

    gambling advertising regulations, and youth protection policies. The structural environment allows
    gambling exposure among minors despite nominal restrictions, highlighting regulatory gaps.
