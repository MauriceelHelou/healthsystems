- 'Step 1: Surgical encounter creates a ''teachable moment'' for behavior change'

- 'Step 3: Patients are motivated by impending surgery and health concerns'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of smoking cessation occur before surgery'

description: Prehabilitation smoking cessation interventions nearly triple the likelihood of smoking cessation
  before surgery (RR 2.9), demonstrating that the surgical encounter is an effective context for promoting
  smoking behavior change.

  equity_implications: The surgical encounter represents a healthcare system touchpoint that can be leveraged
    for population health improvement. Access to these interventions depends on healthcare system capacity
    and may be inequitably distributed across hospital types and geographic areas.
