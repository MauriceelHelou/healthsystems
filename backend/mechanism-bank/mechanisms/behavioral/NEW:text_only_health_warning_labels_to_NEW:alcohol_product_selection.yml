mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Text-only health warning labels are placed on alcohol products communicating health risks'
- 'Step 2: Written warnings require reading and cognitive processing of risk information'
- 'Step 3: Risk information integration influences consumer health risk assessment'
- 'Step 4: Modified risk perception affects product selection preferences'
- 'Step 5: Reduced likelihood of selecting products with text warning labels'

description: Text-only health warning labels on food and alcohol products reduce selection by 21% compared
  to no-label controls, representing a modest but significant structural intervention effect.

  equity_implications: Text-only warnings represent a baseline structural policy intervention that may
    have differential effectiveness across populations with varying literacy levels. While effective,
    the smaller effect size compared to pictorial warnings highlights how policy design choices can either
    mitigate or perpetuate health literacy-related disparities. Equity considerations suggest combining
    text with images to maximize reach across educational and linguistic groups.
