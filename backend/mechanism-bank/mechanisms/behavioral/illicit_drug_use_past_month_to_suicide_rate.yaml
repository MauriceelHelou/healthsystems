  node_name: Suicide Rate
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Illicit drug use leads to neurobiological changes including dysregulation
  of neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, serotonin) that affect mood regulation and
  impulse control'
- 'Step 2: Acute intoxication and chronic use impair judgment, increase impulsivity,
  and lower inhibitions against self-harm'
- 'Step 3: Drug use contributes to social deterioration including relationship breakdown,
  job loss, financial problems, and social isolation - all established suicide risk
  factors'
- 'Step 4: Pathological drug use (dependence/addiction) creates cycles of despair,
  hopelessness, and psychological distress that elevate suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 5: The combined neurobiological impairment, psychosocial stressors, and acute
  intoxication states increase both suicidal ideation and the likelihood of acting
  on suicidal thoughts, resulting in elevated suicide rates'

description: Systematic review of 108 studies demonstrates a consistent positive association
  between illicit drug use and suicidal ideation and behavior across all substance
  use dimensions and all suicidality dimensions in low- and middle-income countries.
  The review identifies substance use as a potentially modifiable risk factor for
  suicide, with the relationship mediated through neurobiological, psychological,
  and social pathways.
