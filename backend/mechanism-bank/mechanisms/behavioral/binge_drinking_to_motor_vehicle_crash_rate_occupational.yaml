mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking patterns develop among occupational drivers (19% prevalence
  among truck drivers), often as a coping mechanism for job-related stress, irregular
  schedules, and time away from home'
- 'Step 2: Acute alcohol intoxication or residual effects from recent binge episodes
  impair psychomotor function, reaction time, judgment, and vigilance during vehicle
  operation'
- 'Step 3: Impaired driving performance increases risk of traffic accidents during
  occupational duties, contributing to elevated motor vehicle crash rates in commercial
  driving populations'

description: Binge drinking among occupational drivers, particularly truck drivers,
  is a significant risk factor for traffic accidents during work. A systematic review
  and meta-analysis found 19% prevalence of binge drinking among truck drivers, with
  alcohol use during driving activities identified as an important risk factor for
  motor vehicle crashes. The pathway operates through acute impairment of driving
  performance and judgment, with additional risk from patterns of everyday drinking
  (9.4%) and alcohol misuse disorders (22.7%).
