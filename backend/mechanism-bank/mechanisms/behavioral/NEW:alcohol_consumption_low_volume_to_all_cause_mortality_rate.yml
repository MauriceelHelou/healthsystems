direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-volume alcohol consumption occurs within a population'
- 'Step 2: When compared to occasional drinking (methodologically rigorous reference group), low-volume
  drinking shows slightly elevated mortality risk'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol''s toxic effects on multiple organ systems contribute to increased mortality even at
  low doses'
- 'Step 4: Previous studies showing protective effects were biased by including ''sick quitters'' in reference
  groups'

description: The low-risk, methodologically rigorous review found that even low-volume drinking is associated
  with a small increase in all-cause mortality (RR=1.02) compared to occasional drinking, contradicting
  the previously reported 'J-shaped' protective effect.

  equity_implications: This finding challenges alcohol industry narratives about 'moderate drinking' health
    benefits. The 'sick quitter effect' methodological bias in 70%+ of prior reviews inflated apparent
    protective effects by including former drinkers (who may have quit due to illness) in reference groups.
    This has policy implications for alcohol consumption guidelines and challenges structural messaging
    about alcohol safety.
