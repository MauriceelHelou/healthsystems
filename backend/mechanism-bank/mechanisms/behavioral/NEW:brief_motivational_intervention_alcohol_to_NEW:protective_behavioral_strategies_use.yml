direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief motivational interventions (BMIs), particularly stand-alone personalized feedback interventions,
  are delivered to college students'
- 'Step 2: Interventions increase awareness of personal drinking patterns and associated risks through
  personalized normative feedback'
- 'Step 3: Students adopt greater use of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) such as limiting number
  of drinks, alternating alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, or avoiding drinking games'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced PBS use serves as a behavioral mechanism mediating intervention effects on downstream
  outcomes'

  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects healthcare access and behavioral intervention availability
    rather than individual blame. The structural component involves the availability and delivery of evidence-based
    interventions through educational or healthcare systems. Equity implications include differential
    access to such interventions based on institutional resources.
