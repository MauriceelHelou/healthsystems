description: SLT users showed 52% lower risk of Hodgkin lymphoma compared to non-users. This surprising
  finding was characterized as unexpected by the authors and requires replication and mechanistic investigation.

  equity_implications: This unexpected protective association should not be interpreted as a benefit of
    SLT use given the established carcinogenicity for other sites. The finding may reflect confounding
    by socioeconomic factors, detection bias, or population-specific factors in South Africa. Caution
    is warranted in interpretation.
