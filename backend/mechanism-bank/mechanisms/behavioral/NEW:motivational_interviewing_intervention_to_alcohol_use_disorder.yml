mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MI intervention delivered in 1-9 sessions addresses alcohol use through client-centered exploration
  of ambivalence'
- 'Step 2: Therapeutic approach strengthens personal motivation for reducing alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Resolved ambivalence leads to commitment to change alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption compared to no intervention or assessment-only conditions'

description: Motivational interviewing demonstrates effectiveness for alcohol use reduction as part of
  broader substance use outcomes. The review included individuals using alcohol alone or in combination
  with drugs. Effects are most pronounced when compared to no intervention, with more modest differences
  compared to assessment and feedback conditions.

  description: MI probably reduces substance use only slightly compared to assessment and feedback over
    medium- and long-term periods
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to MI for alcohol use is mediated by structural factors including healthcare
    coverage, treatment facility availability, and provider training infrastructure. University and clinical
    settings may have greater capacity to deliver MI compared to under-resourced community settings. Veterans'
    health centers represent a structural healthcare system that can systematically provide such interventions.
