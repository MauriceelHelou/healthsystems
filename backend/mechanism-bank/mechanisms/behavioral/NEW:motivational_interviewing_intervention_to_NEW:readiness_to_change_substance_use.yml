category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MI specifically targets ambivalence about change through therapeutic techniques'
- 'Step 2: Client exploration of personal values and goals related to substance use'
- 'Step 3: Resolution of ambivalence through client-driven insight development'
- 'Step 4: Increased readiness and commitment to making behavioral changes'

description: Despite MI being theoretically designed to enhance readiness to change, the review found
  it unclear whether MI has an effect on readiness to change. This suggests a potential disconnect between
  the theoretical mechanism of MI and its measurable impact on this intermediate outcome.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 22776
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Readiness to change may be constrained by structural factors such as social support
    systems, economic stability, housing security, and access to resources needed to sustain change. Individual
    motivation addressed by MI may be necessary but insufficient without addressing structural barriers
    to change.
