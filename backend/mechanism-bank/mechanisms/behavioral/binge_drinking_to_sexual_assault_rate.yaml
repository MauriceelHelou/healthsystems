direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking impairs cognitive functioning, including judgment, risk
  perception, and decision-making abilities'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol intoxication reduces ability to recognize and respond to threatening
  situations or predatory behavior'
- 'Step 3: Intoxication may lead to decreased physical resistance capacity and increased
  vulnerability in social situations'
- 'Step 4: Campus party culture environments where binge drinking occurs often involve
  reduced supervision and increased opportunity for perpetrators'
- 'Step 5: Higher exposure to binge drinking environments correlates with increased
  sexual assault victimization among college students'

description: This meta-analysis of 118 studies identifies binge drinking as a significant
  correlate of sexual assault victimization among U.S. college students. Binge drinking
  is categorized among factors related to campus party culture, alongside general
  alcohol use, drug use, and Greek membership. The relationship is understood within
  the context of alcohol-facilitated sexual assault, where impaired judgment and physical
  capacity increase vulnerability to victimization.
