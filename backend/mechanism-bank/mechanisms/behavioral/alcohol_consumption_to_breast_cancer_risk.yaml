  _original_id: breast_cancer_risk
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption increases circulating estrogen and other hormones'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde (alcohol metabolite) damages DNA and impairs DNA repair'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol increases oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species
  in breast tissue'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure promotes cellular proliferation and inhibits apoptosis
  in breast cells'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated DNA damage and hormonal stimulation increase probability of
  malignant transformation'
