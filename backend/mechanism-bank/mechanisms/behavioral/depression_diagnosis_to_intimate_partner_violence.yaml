direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression reduces self-efficacy, social functioning, and ability to recognize
  or escape unsafe relationship dynamics'
- 'Step 2: Depressive symptoms may lead to social isolation, reduced help-seeking,
  and economic dependency that increases vulnerability to victimization'
- 'Step 3: Depression impairs judgment and coping mechanisms, potentially leading
  individuals to remain in or enter abusive relationships'
- 'Step 4: A bidirectional cycle emerges where depression increases IPV victimization
  risk, and IPV victimization subsequently worsens depressive symptoms'

description: Depression is associated with increased risk of intimate partner violence
  victimization through a bidirectional relationship. Evidence from cohort studies
  demonstrates that depression predicts subsequent IPV victimization with an odds
  ratio of 1.76. Meta-mediation analyses reveal that IPV victimization mediates a
  substantial portion (45-60%) of depression's effects on subsequent relationship
  violence, suggesting an intertwined cycle where depression both increases vulnerability
  to victimization and is exacerbated by it.
