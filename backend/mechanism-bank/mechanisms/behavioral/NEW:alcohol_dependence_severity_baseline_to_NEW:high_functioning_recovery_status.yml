direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower baseline alcohol dependence severity indicates less severe neurobiological adaptation
  to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Less severe dependence is associated with fewer alcohol-related consequences and better preserved
  psychosocial functioning'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with lower dependence severity retain more social, occupational, and mental health
  resources'
- 'Step 4: These preserved resources facilitate achievement of high functioning status post-treatment,
  even with occasional heavy drinking'

description: Lower alcohol dependence severity at baseline predicts membership in the high-functioning
  occasional heavy drinker profile compared to the high-functioning infrequent non-heavy drinker profile
  at 3-year follow-up, suggesting less severe dependence may allow for controlled drinking outcomes.

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies that the severity of alcohol dependence, which can be
    influenced by social determinants including access to early intervention, socioeconomic status, and
    exposure to stress, shapes recovery trajectories. Less severe dependence may reflect earlier access
    to treatment or protective social resources.
