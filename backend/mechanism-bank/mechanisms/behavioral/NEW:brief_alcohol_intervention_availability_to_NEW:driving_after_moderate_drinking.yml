direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students receive brief alcohol interventions targeting drinking behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Interventions provide personalized feedback on drinking patterns and risk behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Students may reduce overall drinking frequency but maintain moderate drinking occasions'
- 'Step 4: Driving decisions after moderate drinking may be less directly addressed by current intervention
  content'
- 'Step 5: Non-significant reduction in driving after 2+/3+ drinks suggests intervention content/timing
  may not adequately target this behavior'

description: Brief alcohol interventions showed a non-significant 9% reduction in odds of driving after
  moderate drinking (2+/3+ drinks). This suggests that current intervention content may need enhancement
  to specifically address driving behaviors at lower consumption thresholds, not just heavy drinking occasions.

  description: Current intervention content and timing may not be optimally designed to address driving

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of significant effect at lower drinking thresholds highlights a structural
    gap in intervention design. Harm reduction approaches may need to more explicitly address driving
    decisions across all drinking levels. This has implications for traffic safety policy and the comprehensiveness
    of college-based prevention programming.
