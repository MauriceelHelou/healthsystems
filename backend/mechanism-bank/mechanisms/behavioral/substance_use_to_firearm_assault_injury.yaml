mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural stressors (poverty, discrimination, trauma) in segregated communities
  contribute to substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 2: Substance use may impair judgment and increase participation in high-risk

  increases exposure to violence'
- 'Step 4: Interaction between substance use contexts and structural disadvantage
  increases firearm assault risk'
