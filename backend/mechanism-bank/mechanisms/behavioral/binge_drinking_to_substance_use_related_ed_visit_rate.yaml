category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking episodes lead to acute alcohol intoxication, resulting in
  blood alcohol concentrations that impair cognitive and motor function'
- 'Step 2: Acute intoxication increases risk of injuries (falls, motor vehicle accidents,
  violence), alcohol poisoning, and exacerbation of underlying health conditions'
- 'Step 3: These acute medical emergencies necessitate emergency room visits for treatment
  of alcohol-related injuries, overdose, or acute health crises'
- 'Step 4: Population-level increases in binge drinking prevalence, particularly among
  middle-aged and older adults, drive corresponding increases in alcohol-related ER
  admissions'

description: This meta-analysis of 6 national surveys establishes that binge drinking
  prevalence increased significantly in the United States between 2000-2016, with
  an average annual increase of 0.72% per year. The study explicitly frames rising
  alcohol-related emergency room admissions as a key indicator of concern alongside
  trends in binge drinking. The mechanism operates through acute intoxication episodes
  leading to medical emergencies requiring ER care. The relationship is particularly
  pronounced among middle-aged and older adults who showed the largest increases in
  binge drinking prevalence.

  description: Adults aged 50-64 and 65+ showed substantially larger increases in
    binge drinking prevalence, while ages 18-29 showed smaller, negative, or nonsignificant
    changes. The increase among middle-aged and older adults may be driving increasing
    rates of alcohol-related morbidity including ER admissions.
