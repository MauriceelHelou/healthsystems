direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients receiving opioid agonist therapy have extremely high tobacco smoking prevalence (85%)'
- 'Step 2: Concurrent substance use disorders create neurobiological vulnerabilities that reinforce tobacco
  dependence'
- 'Step 3: Treatment settings historically prioritize opioid treatment over tobacco cessation'
- 'Step 4: Current smoking cessation interventions show poor effectiveness (<10% quit rate) in this population'
- 'Step 5: Continued high smoking rates lead to disproportionate smoking-related pulmonary disease burden'

description: Among patients receiving opioid agonist therapy, 85% are active tobacco smokers, representing
  a dramatically elevated prevalence compared to general population, contributing to significant pulmonary
  disease burden

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The co-occurrence of opioid use disorder and tobacco use reflects intersecting
    structural vulnerabilities including poverty, trauma, and inadequate integrated healthcare. Historical
    separation of substance use treatment from tobacco cessation services represents a structural failure
    that perpetuates health inequities. The population receiving OAT faces multiple marginalization including
    stigma and healthcare system fragmentation that compounds difficulty accessing effective smoking cessation
    support.
