direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking episodes expose the body to high blood alcohol concentrations
  that cause acute organ stress, particularly to the liver'
- 'Step 2: Repeated binge drinking leads to cumulative liver injury, elevated liver
  biomarkers (e.g., GGT), and progressive liver fibrosis'
- 'Step 3: Chronic binge drinking patterns increase risk of alcoholic liver disease,
  alcohol-related emergency admissions, and alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: The combination of acute alcohol toxicity events and chronic organ damage
  from repeated binge episodes leads to increased alcohol-induced mortality'

description: Binge drinking directly increases alcohol-induced mortality through both
  acute toxicity and cumulative organ damage. Meta-analyses of 6 national surveys
  demonstrate that rising binge drinking prevalence (0.72% annual increase) correlates
  with increases in alcoholic liver disease, alcohol-related emergency room admissions,
  and alcohol use disorder. The mechanism operates through repeated high-dose alcohol
  exposure causing progressive liver injury, as evidenced by elevated GGT levels that
  decrease when drinking is reduced. Studies confirm higher alcohol-attributed mortality
  in groups without intervention to reduce binge drinking.

  description: Binge drinking trends show substantial increases among middle-aged
    (50-64) and older adults (65+), which may be driving increasing rates of alcohol-related
    morbidity and mortality. Younger adults (18-29) show smaller, negative, or nonsignificant
    trends.
