mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher ACE burden creates complex trauma presentations with multiple traumatic memories'
- 'Step 2: Complex trauma alters neurobiological stress response systems and emotion regulation capacity'
- 'Step 3: Standard trauma-focused protocols designed for single-incident trauma may inadequately address
  developmental trauma'
- 'Step 4: Incomplete processing of trauma networks leads to persistent PTSD symptoms despite treatment'

description: Adverse childhood experiences may predict poorer response to trauma-focused psychotherapy
  for PTSD, as early life trauma creates complex presentations that standard single-incident trauma protocols
  may inadequately address. This meta-analysis of 114 studies sought to identify baseline factors associated
  with treatment outcome.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: ACEs are structurally determined by poverty, family instability, community violence,
    and systemic failures in child protection. Non-response to treatment reflects healthcare system limitations
    in adapting evidence-based treatments for populations with complex trauma histories rooted in structural
    disadvantage. Equity implications include that marginalized populations with higher ACE burden may
    receive less effective care.
