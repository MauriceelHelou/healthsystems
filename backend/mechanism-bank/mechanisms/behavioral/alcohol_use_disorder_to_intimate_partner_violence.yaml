  node_name: Intimate Partner Violence
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption impairs cognitive functioning, judgment, and impulse
  control, reducing inhibitions against aggressive behavior'
- 'Step 2: Intoxication amplifies negative emotional states and misinterpretation
  of social cues, increasing likelihood of aggressive responses to perceived provocations'
- 'Step 3: Heavy drinking patterns create relationship conflict around drinking behavior,
  financial strain, and role dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Acute intoxication episodes trigger violent incidents, with frequency and
  severity of IPV increasing with frequency of drunkenness'
- 'Step 5: Harmful alcohol use becomes embedded in syndemic interactions with other
  risk factors (HIV, stress, poverty), creating compounding vulnerability for IPV
  perpetration and victimization'

description: 'Alcohol use demonstrates a robust positive association with intimate
  partner violence perpetration and victimization. Harmful alcohol use among men is
  associated with 3.45 times higher odds of perpetrating physical IPV compared to
  non-drinkers. The relationship shows a clear dose-response pattern: women with occasionally
  drunk partners have 2.68 times higher odds of experiencing IPV, while those with
  frequently drunk partners have 5.94 times higher odds. Alcohol use by partners increases
  women''s risk of IPV during pregnancy with odds ratios ranging from 2.89-11.60.
  The mechanism operates through alcohol''s disinhibiting effects on aggressive impulses,
  impaired judgment, and relationship dysfunction. Syndemic interactions with HIV
  and substance abuse create synergistic effects in high-burden settings.'
