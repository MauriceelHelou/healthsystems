direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mental contrasting helps individuals identify discrepancy between desired future (reduced/quit
  cannabis use) and present reality'
- 'Step 2: Implementation intentions create specific if-then plans for managing high-risk situations'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive planning reduces reliance on willpower alone by automating behavioral responses'
- 'Step 4: Combined approach enhances both motivation and self-regulation capacity for goal achievement'

description: MCII-based intervention led to 69% of participants meeting objective cannabis reduction targets,
  compared to 49% in the SMART goals-only control condition. Both intervention conditions outperformed
  minimal intervention control in achieving subjective and objective reduction goals.

  description: Adding cue-control to MCII did not enhance outcomes compared to MCII alone (60% vs 69%
    goal achievement)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism operates at the individual behavioral level, it provides a
    scalable, accessible intervention that can be deployed through digital infrastructure. The approach
    shifts focus from individual blame to providing structured cognitive tools that support behavior change
    within individuals' environmental contexts.
