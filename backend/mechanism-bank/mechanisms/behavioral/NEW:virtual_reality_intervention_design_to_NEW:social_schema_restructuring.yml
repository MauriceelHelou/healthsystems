direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Short, focused VRI scenarios accommodate limited attention and concentration capacity in people
  with MHD/SUD'
- 'Step 2: Sequenced and deliberately structured learning workflows enable repetition of immersive experiences'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure allows restructuring of maladaptive social schemas formed through adverse
  experiences'
- 'Step 4: New, repaired schemas are stored in long-term memory through accommodated perceptual processing'
- 'Step 5: Restructured social schemas promote improved social participation and recovery'

description: Virtual reality-based interventions designed with short, focused scenarios in sequenced workflows
  can accommodate the cognitive limitations (attention deficit, concentration, memory challenges) common
  in people with MHD/SUD, enabling restructuring of maladaptive social schemas and promoting sustained
  real-life benefits for social participation and recovery.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how healthcare intervention design (structural factor)
    must accommodate the neurocognitive impacts of mental health and substance use disorders. The study
    avoids blaming individuals for treatment failure by recognizing that 'human capacity to achieve sustained
    learning outcomes from multisensory immersive learning experiences was limited in general' and especially
    so for this population. The equity implication is that standard intervention designs may systematically
    fail people with MHD/SUD due to unaccommodated cognitive differences, creating a structural barrier
    to treatment benefit.
