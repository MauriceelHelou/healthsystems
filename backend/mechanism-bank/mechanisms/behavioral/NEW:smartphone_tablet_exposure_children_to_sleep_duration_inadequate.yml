mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children are exposed to smartphones and tablets in home and school environments'
- 'Step 2: Device use displaces sleep time and delays bedtime routines'
- 'Step 3: Arousing content increases cognitive and physiological activation before sleep'
- 'Step 4: Children using devices have significantly higher odds of shortened sleep duration'

description: Children using smartphones and tablets were 1.79 times more likely to have shorter sleep
  duration compared to those with lower usage (OR = 1.79; 95%CI = 1.72-1.86). This represents a robust
  association with narrow confidence intervals indicating high precision.

  description: Higher exposure duration associated with greater odds of shortened sleep
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The structural context includes technology industry practices targeting children,
    inadequate policy frameworks limiting children's digital exposure, and socioeconomic factors influencing
    parental capacity to provide alternative enrichment activities. Lower-income families may have fewer
    resources for supervised activities, potentially increasing reliance on screen-based entertainment.
