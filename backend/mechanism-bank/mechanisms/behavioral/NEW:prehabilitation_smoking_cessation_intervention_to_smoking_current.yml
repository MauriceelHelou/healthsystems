description: Prehabilitation smoking cessation effects are sustained at 12 months post-surgery (RR 1.74),
  demonstrating the long-term behavioral change potential of surgical teachable moments.

  equity_implications: This finding has important implications for population health - healthcare system
    surgical encounters can serve as intervention points for sustained behavior change. However, the absence
    of equity analysis means it is unknown whether these benefits are equitably distributed across socioeconomic
    and demographic groups. The review explicitly notes that no trials examined effects by equality measures.
