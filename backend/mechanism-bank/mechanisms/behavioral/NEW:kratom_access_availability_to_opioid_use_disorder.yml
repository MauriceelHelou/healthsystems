direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Kratom contains alkaloids (mitragynine, 7-hydroxymitragynine) that act as partial mu-opioid
  receptor agonists'
- 'Step 2: These compounds produce opioid-like effects that may reduce opioid craving and withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Individuals self-administer kratom as a substitute for more harmful opioids'
- 'Step 4: Reduced reliance on illicit opioids decreases progression and severity of opioid use disorder'

description: Kratom's pharmacological properties as a partial mu-opioid agonist suggest potential for
  reducing opioid use disorder severity through substitution and withdrawal management, though evidence
  remains preliminary
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Historically used in Southeast Asia for harm reduction; growing use in the US with
    different regulatory context

  description: Kratom use may be more prevalent among those lacking access to or reluctant to seek conventional
    MAT
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how barriers to conventional SUD treatment (stigma, access,
    cost) may drive individuals toward unregulated alternatives like kratom. The lack of treatment access
    is a structural issue rooted in healthcare system failures, not individual choice.
