direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CHDs experience high levels of occupational stress, trauma exposure, and emotional exhaustion'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate access to formal psychological support creates unmet mental health needs'
- 'Step 3: Shift work and irregular schedules disrupt normal social support networks and healthy coping
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol is used as a coping mechanism for occupational stress and to self-medicate untreated
  mental health symptoms'
- 'Step 5: Pattern of hazardous drinking develops as maladaptive response to structural work conditions'

description: Pooled prevalence of hazardous drinking among emergency call-handlers and dispatchers is
  17.8%, equal to PTSD prevalence. This reflects occupational stress-related alcohol use as a coping mechanism
  for the psychological demands of the job.

  variation_notes: Wide confidence interval (6.9-32.2%) indicates substantial heterogeneity across the

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Hazardous drinking among CHDs should be understood as a structural outcome of inadequate
    occupational mental health support rather than individual moral failing. The work environment creates
    conditions conducive to maladaptive coping. Interventions should include mandatory employee assistance
    programs, peer support programs, and normalization of mental health help-seeking within first responder
    culture. Alcohol use disparities in this population reflect gaps in organizational support rather
    than individual choice.
