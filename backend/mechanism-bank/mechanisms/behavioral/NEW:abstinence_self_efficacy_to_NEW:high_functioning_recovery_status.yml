category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower abstinence self-efficacy reflects reduced confidence in maintaining complete abstinence'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with lower abstinence self-efficacy may adopt moderation goals rather than abstinence'
- 'Step 3: Some individuals achieve high psychosocial functioning despite occasional heavy drinking'
- 'Step 4: This suggests abstinence is not the sole pathway to functional recovery for all individuals'

description: High-functioning occasional heavy drinkers had significantly lower abstinence self-efficacy
  at 3-year follow-up compared to high-functioning infrequent non-heavy drinkers, suggesting different
  recovery pathways.

  equity_implications: Self-efficacy development is influenced by social support, treatment quality, and
    community resources. The existence of high-functioning individuals with lower abstinence self-efficacy
    challenges the dominant abstinence-only recovery paradigm and suggests need for individualized approaches.
