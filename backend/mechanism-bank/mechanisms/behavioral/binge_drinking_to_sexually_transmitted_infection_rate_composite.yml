mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption leads to risky sexual behaviors (early initiation, inconsistent condom
  use, multiple partners)'
- 'Step 2: These risky sexual behaviors increase exposure to sexually transmitted infections'
- 'Step 3: Impaired judgment during intoxication reduces likelihood of STI prevention behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure through multiple risk behaviors elevates STI acquisition risk'

description: This mechanism represents the downstream health consequence pathway where alcohol consumption
  leads to risky sexual behaviors that ultimately increase STI risk. The study documents the intermediate
  behavioral outcomes that are established STI risk factors.

  equity_implications: The call for prevention programs initiated at early age and supported by homes,
    schools, and communities reflects understanding that structural interventions are needed. Addressing
    this pathway requires integrated approaches combining alcohol policy, comprehensive sexual health
    education, and accessible STI testing/treatment. Equity concerns include differential access to prevention
    resources, healthcare, and testing services across communities with varying socioeconomic conditions.
