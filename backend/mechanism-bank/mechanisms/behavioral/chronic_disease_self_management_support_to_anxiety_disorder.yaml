  that teach skills including decision-making, taking action, and problem-solving
  related to their health conditions'
- 'Step 2: These interventions enhance patients'' sense of self-efficacy and perceived
  control over their health management, reducing feelings of helplessness and uncertainty'

  and reduced psychological distress, including decreased anxiety symptoms'

description: Self-management interventions for adults with chronic physical diseases
  significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. A systematic review and meta-analysis of
  15 studies (n=2064) found that self-management interventions produced significant
  reductions in anxiety at short-term follow-up (baseline to <6 months). The interventions
  work by building patients' capacity to make health-related decisions, take appropriate
  actions, and manage their conditions effectively, which reduces the uncertainty
  and worry that often accompanies chronic illness.
