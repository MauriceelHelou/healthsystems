mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with comorbid PTSD and AUD present with more complex symptom profiles'
- 'Step 2: Standard treatment protocols may not adequately address both conditions simultaneously'
- 'Step 3: Increased symptom severity leads to greater treatment challenges'
- 'Step 4: Poorer treatment outcomes and higher likelihood of treatment failure or dropout'

description: The abstract explicitly states that individuals with dual PTSD-AUD diagnosis 'exhibit increased
  symptom severity and poorer treatment outcomes than those with only one of these diseases.' This highlights
  the clinical challenge of treating comorbid conditions.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Healthcare system fragmentation between mental health and substance use treatment
    creates structural barriers to integrated care. Insurance coverage limitations, separate treatment
    facilities, and lack of cross-trained providers represent systemic failures that worsen outcomes for
    those with comorbid conditions. These structural barriers disproportionately affect populations with
    less healthcare access.
