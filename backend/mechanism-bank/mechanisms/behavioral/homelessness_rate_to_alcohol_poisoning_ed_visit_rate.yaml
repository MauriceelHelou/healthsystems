direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persons experiencing homelessness face chronic environmental stressors
  including lack of stable housing, social isolation, and economic insecurity that
  contribute to elevated rates of alcohol use as a coping mechanism'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to primary healthcare and preventive services means alcohol
  use disorders among homeless populations often go untreated, leading to escalation
  of consumption and higher risk of acute intoxication'
- 'Step 3: Homeless individuals lack safe, private spaces for shelter, leading to
  outdoor drinking and exposure to elements that compound alcohol''s physiological
  effects'
- 'Step 4: When acute alcohol poisoning occurs, homeless individuals are more likely
  to be brought to Emergency Departments by outreach workers, police, or bystanders
  rather than receiving care at home'
- 'Step 5: Up to one-third of ED visits by persons experiencing homelessness are attributed
  to alcohol-related diagnoses, with rate ratios of ED use 1.63 to 18.75 times higher
  than housed populations'

description: 'Systematic review of 36 studies demonstrates that persons experiencing
  homelessness utilize Emergency Departments at significantly higher rates than housed
  populations, with alcohol-related diagnoses accounting for up to one-third of all
  ED visits. The pathway operates through multiple behavioral and structural mechanisms:
  chronic stress and limited coping resources increase alcohol use, lack of primary
  care access prevents early intervention, and absence of safe private spaces leads
  to public intoxication requiring emergency response. Rate ratios of ED use among
  homeless populations range from 1.63 to 18.75 times that of non-homeless individuals.'
