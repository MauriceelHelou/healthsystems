direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Physical activity during early pregnancy (first trimester) establishes metabolic patterns before
  placental hormones significantly alter insulin sensitivity'
- 'Step 2: Early exercise intervention prevents excessive early gestational weight gain that predisposes
  to insulin resistance'
- 'Step 3: Curvilinear dose-response relationship indicates greatest benefit from initial activity increases,
  with diminishing returns at very high levels'
- 'Step 4: Achieving minimum guideline of 10 MET-h/week in first trimester provides significant (13%)
  risk reduction'

description: Physical activity specifically during the first trimester shows a curvilinear dose-response
  relationship with GDM risk. Achieving the minimum guideline of 10 MET-h/week reduces GDM risk by 13%
  compared to inactive pregnant individuals.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: First trimester is a critical window when many pregnant individuals may not yet
    know they are pregnant or have access to prenatal care that promotes physical activity. Structural
    barriers include delayed entry into prenatal care due to insurance gaps, lack of early pregnancy support
    programs, and workplace policies that do not accommodate early pregnancy symptoms that might affect
    physical activity participation.
