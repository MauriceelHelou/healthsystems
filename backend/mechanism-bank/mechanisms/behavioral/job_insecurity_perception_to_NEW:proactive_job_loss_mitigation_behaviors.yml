description: Job insecurity leads to proactive measures by employees to alleviate threat of job loss,
  representing an adaptive but potentially exhausting response to structural conditions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While framed as proactive employee behavior, these responses are compelled by structural
    conditions of employment insecurity. Workers must expend additional effort to maintain employment,
    creating additional burden on those already experiencing stress from insecurity. This represents forced
    adaptation to precarious employment conditions.
