direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol consumption (≥10 drinks/week) creates chronic vascular stress through repeated
  episodes of elevated blood pressure and heart rate'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolites and oxidative stress promote endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation accelerates atherosclerotic plaque formation in peripheral arteries'
- 'Step 4: Progressive arterial narrowing leads to reduced blood flow to extremities and peripheral artery
  disease development'

description: High-to-heavy alcohol consumption (≥10 drinks/week) was associated with elevated peripheral
  artery disease risk compared to non-drinkers, though the association was not statistically significant
  (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83-1.07). The nonlinear meta-analysis revealed pronounced PAD risk at ≥10 drinks/week.

  description: U-shaped relationship where light-moderate drinking shows protective effect while heavy
    drinking (≥10 drinks/week) shows increased risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism involves individual behavior, heavy alcohol consumption is
    often structurally determined by factors including alcohol outlet density, targeted marketing in disadvantaged
    communities, economic stress, and lack of access to treatment services. Structural interventions addressing
    alcohol availability and affordability may be more effective than individual-level approaches.
