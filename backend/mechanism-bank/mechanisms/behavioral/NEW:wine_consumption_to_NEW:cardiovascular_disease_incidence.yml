mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Wine consumption provides polyphenolic compounds with cardioprotective properties'
- 'Step 2: These compounds improve lipid profiles by increasing HDL cholesterol and reducing LDL oxidation'
- 'Step 3: Anti-inflammatory effects reduce chronic low-grade inflammation associated with CVD development'
- 'Step 4: Improved endothelial function and reduced platelet aggregation decrease CVD incidence'

description: 'Pooled analysis using DerSimonian and Laird approach showed wine consumption inversely associated
  with CVD risk (RR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.98). The association remained stable across different age groups,
  sex compositions, and follow-up durations.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The structural determinants of alcohol consumption patterns are shaped by socioeconomic
    factors, cultural contexts, and policy environments. Wine consumption specifically may reflect socioeconomic
    privilege, as wine tends to be more expensive than other alcoholic beverages. This creates potential
    confounding where apparent health benefits may partially reflect unmeasured socioeconomic advantages.
    Policy implications should focus on harm reduction rather than promoting consumption.
