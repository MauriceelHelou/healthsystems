description: Adolescents who attend open bar parties report more alcohol-related problems compared to
  non-attendees, reflecting the harmful consequences of environments designed to maximize alcohol consumption
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 5213
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how commercial interests in maximizing alcohol sales
    create harm, particularly for developmentally vulnerable adolescents. The absence of effective policy
    enforcement allows these harms to continue.
