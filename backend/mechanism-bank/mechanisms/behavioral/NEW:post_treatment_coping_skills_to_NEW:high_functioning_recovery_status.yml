direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with occasional heavy drinking post-treatment demonstrate fewer coping skills acquired
  during treatment'
- 'Step 2: Lower coping skills may reflect different treatment engagement or differential skill retention'
- 'Step 3: Despite fewer coping skills, these individuals maintain high psychosocial functioning through
  other pathways'
- 'Step 4: This suggests multiple recovery pathways exist, not all requiring intensive coping skill development'

description: High-functioning occasional heavy drinkers had lower post-treatment coping skills compared
  to high-functioning infrequent non-heavy drinkers, indicating that coping skill development differentiates
  these recovery profiles.

  equity_implications: Access to and quality of treatment that builds coping skills may vary by socioeconomic
    status, geographic location, and insurance coverage. The finding that high functioning is achievable
    without maximum coping skill development challenges one-size-fits-all treatment approaches.
