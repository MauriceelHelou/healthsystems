description: The pooled post-intervention abstinence rate across follow-up periods was 18.8% (95% CI [15.5,
  22.1]), indicating that psychological interventions can facilitate smoking cessation attempts among
  incarcerated populations. However, moderate to high heterogeneity was observed.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding demonstrates that incarcerated individuals can successfully quit smoking
    when provided appropriate support, challenging stereotypes about this population's capacity for health
    behavior change. The structural barrier is not individual motivation but rather access to evidence-based
    interventions. Investment in correctional health services represents an equity-promoting approach
    to reducing smoking-related health disparities in a population with concentrated health burdens.
