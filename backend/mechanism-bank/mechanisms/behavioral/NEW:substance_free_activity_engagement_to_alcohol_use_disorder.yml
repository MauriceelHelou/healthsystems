direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals in recovery engage in substance-free reinforcing activities (self-care, social
  connections, creative outlets, acts of service)'
- 'Step 2: These activities provide alternative sources of reward and positive reinforcement that compete
  with alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Increased substance-free reinforcement reduces the relative value of alcohol-related rewards
  (behavioral economic substitution)'
- 'Step 4: Activity maintenance becomes linked to intrinsic motivation (personal interest) rather than
  external pressure'
- 'Step 5: Sustained engagement in substance-free activities supports successful recovery from alcohol
  use disorder'

description: Based on behavioral economic theory of addiction, substance use often occurs in environments
  with limited substance-free reinforcement. Engaging in substance-free activities (self-care, social
  connections, acts of service, creative outlets) provides alternative sources of reward that can reduce
  alcohol use. Participants identified these activities as key aids to successful recovery, though treatment
  programs do not consistently support this during the critical early recovery period.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights a structural gap in alcohol treatment programs - the
    inconsistent integration of substance-free activity support despite patient-reported importance. The
    finding that group therapy participants received less consistent support than individual therapy participants
    suggests a treatment system design issue. The behavioral economic framing appropriately situates the
    problem in environmental reinforcement structures rather than individual willpower or moral failing.
    Equity implications include that access to substance-free activities may vary by socioeconomic status,
    geography, and treatment program resources.
