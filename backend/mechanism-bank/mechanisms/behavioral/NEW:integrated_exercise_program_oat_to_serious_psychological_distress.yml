direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OAT patients with existing psychological vulnerabilities engage in structured exercise program'
- 'Step 2: Exercise program may create additional physical and psychological demands'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate psychosocial support, exercise-induced stress may exacerbate distress'
- 'Step 4: Psychological distress scores increased from 1.85 to 2.03 on SCL-10'

description: 'Exercise program integration was associated with slight increase in psychological distress,
  with SCL-10 scores rising from 1.85 (SD: 0.66) to 2.03 (SD: 0.59), suggesting exercise interventions
  in OAT populations may require concurrent mental health support.'

  equity_implications: This finding highlights the complex needs of OAT populations and the importance
    of comprehensive, integrated care that addresses both physical and mental health. Simply adding exercise
    without adequate psychosocial infrastructure may inadvertently increase burden on vulnerable populations
    already experiencing high rates of mental health comorbidities.
