direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy intervention removes menthol tobacco products from retail displays'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents exposed to retail environment with menthol products removed'
- 'Step 3: Injunctive norms mediate the relationship (potentially through reactance or forbidden fruit
  effect)'
- 'Step 4: Paradoxically, intentions to smoke menthol cigarettes INCREASE'
- 'Step 5: This represents a potential unintended consequence requiring complementary public health messaging'

description: The total effect of removing menthol cigarette displays on youth smoking intentions is paradoxically
  positive (increasing intentions), mediated through changes in injunctive norms. This suggests that menthol
  ban policies may have unintended consequences that could be mitigated through targeted public health
  communications addressing social norms.

  description: 'Three conditions tested: status quo (all flavors displayed), tobacco/menthol only (sweet
    flavors removed), and tobacco-only (all flavored products removed). The effect operated through the
    tobacco-only condition where menthol was removed.'
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism is critical for health equity policy design. Menthol tobacco products
    have been disproportionately marketed to Black communities for decades, leading to higher menthol
    cigarette use and associated health disparities. While menthol bans are intended to reduce these disparities,
    this study reveals potential unintended consequences that must be addressed through complementary
    structural interventions (e.g., public health communications targeting injunctive norms) rather than
    abandoning the policy. The finding emphasizes that structural interventions require careful implementation
    with attention to psychological and social mechanisms.
