- 'Step 1: Culturally adapted school-based prevention curriculum (YSLQQ) delivered by trained facilitators
  provides structured education about substance dangers'
- 'Step 2: Comprehensive social-influence approach builds adolescent skills to resist peer pressure and
  substance use initiation'
- 'Step 3: Students acquire knowledge about dangers of substances and develop refusal skills'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced protective factors reduce episodes of drunkenness among adolescents'

description: A 12-hour class-based curriculum using comprehensive social-influence approach delivered
  by trained facilitators significantly reduced drunkenness in past year and past 30 days among intervention
  students compared to controls. 79.2% of students reported learning about dangers of substances and 65.8%
  reported gaining skills to avoid substance use.

  variation_notes: Program culturally adapted from European 'Unplugged' program to Chilean context, suggesting
    mechanism effectiveness may vary by cultural setting

  description: Facilitators implemented intervention according to manual in 73.9% of sessions; higher

  description: Adaptation to local Chilean context improves acceptability and potentially effectiveness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses substance use through structural educational intervention
    rather than individual blame. The school-based delivery system ensures equitable access within public
    schools. Program implementation in public schools in Chile specifically targets populations that may
    lack access to private prevention resources, addressing structural inequities in health education
    access.
