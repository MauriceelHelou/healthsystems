direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU) exposes individuals to opioid
  substances outside of clinical supervision and therapeutic dosing guidelines'
- 'Step 2: Repeated non-medical use leads to neurobiological adaptations in reward
  circuitry, including tolerance development and physical dependence'
- 'Step 3: Progressive patterns of use emerge, characterized by escalating doses,
  compulsive drug-seeking behavior, and loss of control over use'
- 'Step 4: These behavioral and neurobiological changes culminate in the clinical
  presentation of opioid use disorder (OUD) as defined by diagnostic criteria'

description: A systematic review of 182 studies found that the largest body of evidence
  (71%, 129 studies) examined associations between NMPOU and mental and behavioral
  disorders, with particularly strong evidence linking NMPOU to opioid use disorder.
  The review identified a large body of evidence establishing associations between
  non-medical prescription opioid use and the development of opioid use disorder,
  supporting a clear behavioral pathway from misuse to disorder.
