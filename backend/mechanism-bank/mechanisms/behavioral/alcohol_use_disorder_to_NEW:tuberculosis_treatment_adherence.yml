direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder impairs cognitive function and decision-making capacity'
- 'Step 2: AUD creates competing priorities that interfere with complex medication regimens'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related social instability (housing, employment) disrupts healthcare access and appointment
  adherence'
- 'Step 4: Potential pharmacological interactions between alcohol and TB medications reduce treatment
  effectiveness'
- 'Step 5: Poor compliance leads to treatment failure and worse TB outcomes'

description: The review establishes that alcohol use disorders in tuberculosis patients are complicated
  by poor compliance to anti-tuberculosis treatment and poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes. This bidirectional
  relationship creates a cycle where TB burden increases AUD risk and AUD worsens TB outcomes.

  variation_notes: The relationship between AUD and TB treatment outcomes likely varies by healthcare

  description: Integrated TB-AUD screening and management programs may mitigate negative effects on treatment
    adherence
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects healthcare system failures to integrate mental health/substance
    use screening into infectious disease care. The structural determinants include fragmented healthcare
    systems that treat TB and AUD separately, lack of trained personnel for dual diagnosis management,
    and insufficient resources for comprehensive patient support. The recommendation for early screening
    and management points to structural interventions rather than individual behavior modification.
