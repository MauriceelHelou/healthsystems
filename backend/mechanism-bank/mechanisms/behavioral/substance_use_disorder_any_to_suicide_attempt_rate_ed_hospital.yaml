direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorder causes neurobiological changes including impaired
  prefrontal cortex function, affecting impulse control, decision-making, and emotional
  regulation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic substance use leads to social consequences including relationship
  deterioration, interpersonal conflict, job loss, and social isolation, creating
  psychosocial stressors'
- 'Step 3: Acute intoxication further impairs judgment and lowers inhibitions, increasing
  the likelihood of acting on suicidal thoughts (ideation-to-enaction facilitation)'
- 'Step 4: Comorbid psychiatric conditions (depression, personality disorders) frequently
  co-occur with substance use disorder, compounding suicide risk through shared vulnerability
  pathways'
- 'Step 5: Substance use disorder reduces help-seeking behavior and treatment engagement,
  while withdrawal states may precipitate acute suicidal crises, leading to increased
  emergency department presentations for suicide attempts'

description: Substance use disorder demonstrates a consistent positive association
  with suicide attempts across all substance types (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, illicit
  drugs, prescription drug misuse) and all dimensions of use (intoxication, regular
  use, pathological use). The lifetime risk of suicide in patients with substance
  use disorder is 5-10 times higher than the general population. Mechanisms include
  neurobiological impairment of impulse control, psychosocial deterioration, facilitation
  of ideation-to-enaction transitions during intoxication, and frequent comorbidity
  with other psychiatric disorders. The relationship holds across diverse populations
  including military personnel, individuals with personality disorders, and populations
  in low- and middle-income countries.
