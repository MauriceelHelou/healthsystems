direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Humanitarian crises displace populations and disrupt normal hygiene infrastructure and practices'
- 'Step 2: WaSH interventions provide hygiene education and access to handwashing facilities and supplies'
- 'Step 3: Environmental modifications enable sustained hygiene practice changes (e.g., handwashing stations
  placement)'
- 'Step 4: Community-level interventions create social norms supporting hygiene behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Improved hygiene behaviors reduce transmission of enteric and respiratory pathogens'

description: WaSH interventions during humanitarian crises improve behavioral outcomes related to hygiene
  practices by providing both the infrastructure (water access, handwashing stations) and education necessary
  to sustain healthy behaviors in crisis settings. The review explicitly examines both health and behavioral
  outcomes as critical endpoints.

  variation_notes: Research gaps noted in geographical distribution suggest variation in evidence across
    different humanitarian settings and populations

  description: Review notes insufficient reporting of some interventions with related outcomes, suggesting
    variability in how hygiene interventions are implemented and reported
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism includes behavioral outcomes, it frames behavior change as
    contingent on structural enablers (access to water, facilities, supplies) rather than individual motivation.
    This structural competency lens recognizes that hygiene behaviors during crises are constrained by
    infrastructure availability, not personal responsibility. The approach appropriately centers environmental
    and policy interventions over individual-level behavioral messaging.
