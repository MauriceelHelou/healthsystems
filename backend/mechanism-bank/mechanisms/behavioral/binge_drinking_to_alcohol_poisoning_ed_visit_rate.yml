mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social environments promoting binge drinking normalize rapid consumption of large alcohol quantities'
- 'Step 2: Acute alcohol intoxication overwhelms hepatic metabolism capacity'
- 'Step 3: Blood alcohol concentration rises to toxic levels causing central nervous system depression'
- 'Step 4: Medical emergency requiring emergency department intervention and potential hospitalization'

  among young people aged 15-23 in the study. This represents a significant structural driver of emergency

  description: Adolescents and young adults (15-23) show particular vulnerability to binge drinking patterns
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While binge drinking appears as individual behavior, it is shaped by structural
    factors including alcohol marketing targeting youth, social environments in educational settings,
    and inadequate enforcement of age restrictions on alcohol sales. Prevention requires addressing these
    upstream determinants rather than solely focusing on individual behavior change.
