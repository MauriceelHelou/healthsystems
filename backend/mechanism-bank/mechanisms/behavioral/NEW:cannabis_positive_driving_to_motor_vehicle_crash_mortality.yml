description: Meta-analysis of 13 culpability studies examining crash risk among cannabis-positive drivers.
  Using a Bayesian statistical model to avoid interpretational bias inherent in traditional odds ratio
  approaches, the study found a modest 28% increase in total crash risk (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.16-1.40) and
  42% increase in culpable crash risk (95% credibility interval 1.11-1.75). The attributable risk fraction
  was below 2% in most studies, indicating cannabis impaired driving contributes minimally to overall
  crash burden.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism has important policy implications for drug-impaired driving laws
    and enforcement. The relatively modest effect size (compared to alcohol impairment) and low attributable
    risk fraction suggest that punitive drug testing policies may have limited public health impact. Structural
    approaches should consider: (1) whether per se THC limits accurately reflect impairment, (2) racial
    disparities in drug testing and enforcement, (3) alternative transportation infrastructure that reduces
    need for impaired driving. The study highlights methodological issues in how risk is communicated
    to policymakers, which can lead to disproportionate policy responses.'
