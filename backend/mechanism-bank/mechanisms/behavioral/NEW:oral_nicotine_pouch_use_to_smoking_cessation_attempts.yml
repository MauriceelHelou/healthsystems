direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oral nicotine pouches provide alternative nicotine delivery without combustion'
- 'Step 2: Users substitute cigarettes with nicotine pouches to maintain nicotine levels'
- 'Step 3: Reduced exposure to combustion products may facilitate transition away from smoking'
- 'Step 4: Nicotine delivery sustains attempts to abstain from cigarettes'

description: Oral nicotine pouches may slightly increase smoking abstinence compared to no intervention
  at 8-week follow-up, but evidence is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision

  description: Higher-dose ONP showed higher quit rates compared to lower-dose (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.26-96.13),
    though evidence is imprecise
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to harm reduction policy and regulatory frameworks for nicotine
    products. Access to alternative nicotine delivery systems represents a structural intervention that
    could reduce combustible tobacco harms. However, industry involvement in research and marketing raises
    equity concerns about who benefits from these products.
