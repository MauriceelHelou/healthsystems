direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NoLo advertising increases exposure to alcohol brand imagery for vulnerable populations'
- 'Step 2: Those in recovery or who drink harmfully encounter triggering brand cues in protected spaces'
- 'Step 3: Brand cues may activate craving and relapse risk'
- 'Step 4: Regulatory loopholes prevent escape from alcohol marketing even in ostensibly protected areas'
- 'Step 5: Increased risk of harmful drinking or relapse among vulnerable populations'

description: NoLo advertising that uses parent brand imagery may trigger cravings and increase relapse
  risk among people in recovery from alcohol use disorder or those who currently drink harmfully, as brand
  cues appear in spaces where they expected protection from alcohol marketing.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how regulatory loopholes create differential harm - people
    in recovery cannot avoid alcohol brand triggers even in legally protected spaces. The structural failure
    is inadequate policy implementation that prioritizes industry interests over protecting vulnerable
    populations.
