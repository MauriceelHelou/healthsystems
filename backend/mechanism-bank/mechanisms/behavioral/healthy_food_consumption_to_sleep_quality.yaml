category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Consumption of nutrient-dense foods provides essential vitamins, minerals,
  and amino acids necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis involved in sleep regulation'
- 'Step 2: Healthy dietary patterns stabilize blood glucose levels, preventing nighttime
  hypoglycemia that can cause sleep fragmentation'
- 'Step 3: Anti-inflammatory properties of whole foods, fruits, and vegetables reduce
  systemic inflammation that can disrupt sleep architecture'
- 'Step 4: Adequate intake of sleep-promoting nutrients (tryptophan, magnesium, B
  vitamins) supports melatonin production and circadian rhythm regulation'
