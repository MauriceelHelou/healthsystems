  node_name: Externalizing Disorders (ADHD, Conduct Disorder)
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Electronic cigarette use exposes youth to nicotine during critical periods
  of prefrontal cortex development, which governs impulse control and executive function'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine-induced alterations in dopaminergic pathways and prefrontal-subcortical
  circuits impair behavioral regulation and increase impulsivity'
- 'Step 3: Compromised executive function and impulse control manifest as externalizing
  behaviors including attention problems, hyperactivity, and conduct problems'
- 'Step 4: Youth with pre-existing externalizing disorders may also be more likely
  to initiate vaping due to impulsivity and risk-taking propensity'
