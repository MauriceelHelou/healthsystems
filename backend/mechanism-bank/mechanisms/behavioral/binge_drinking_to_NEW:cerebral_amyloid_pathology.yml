description: Alcohol consumption patterns are associated with cerebral amyloid pathology in persons without
  dementia, suggesting a biological pathway linking drinking behavior to Alzheimer's disease precursor
  states.

  description: Study stratified by normal cognition (NC) vs mild cognitive impairment (MCI), suggesting
    differential effects by baseline cognitive status
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism appears behavioral, structural factors including alcohol marketing,
    outlet density, and economic stressors drive population-level drinking patterns. Policies regulating
    alcohol availability and pricing would be upstream interventions.
