direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women with AUD experience increased vulnerability and exposure to high-risk situations'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-related disinhibition and impaired judgment increase trauma exposure risk'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological effects of chronic alcohol use may impair stress response systems'
- 'Step 4: Following traumatic exposure, PTSD develops with heightened vulnerability'

description: 'Among women, AUD predicted a 2.06-fold increased risk of developing PTSD (HR=2.06, 95% CI:
  2.01-2.12), providing support for the susceptibility model. The effect was lower than for men and lower
  than the self-medication pathway effect.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Women with AUD may face particular structural vulnerabilities including heightened
    stigma, barriers to treatment access due to childcare responsibilities, and increased exposure to
    interpersonal violence. Economic dependence and housing instability in the context of AUD may further
    increase trauma exposure risk. These structural factors compound biological and psychological vulnerabilities.
