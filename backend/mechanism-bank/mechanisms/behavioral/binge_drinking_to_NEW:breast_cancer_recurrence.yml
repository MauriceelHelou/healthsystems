category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-diagnosis alcohol consumption exposes breast tissue to ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde causes DNA damage and interferes with DNA repair mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol increases estrogen levels which may promote hormone-receptor positive breast cancer'
- 'Step 4: Despite biological plausibility, meta-analysis shows no significant association with recurrence'

  (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77-1.37, p=0.88) based on 7 cohort studies with 4638 recurrence cases.

    showed significant associations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While alcohol is an established risk factor for breast cancer incidence, this meta-analysis
    finds no evidence that it affects prognosis after diagnosis. This is relevant for clinical counseling
    and should not be used to blame patients for their disease outcomes. Structural factors affecting
    alcohol access and marketing may influence initial cancer risk but appear less relevant for prognosis.
