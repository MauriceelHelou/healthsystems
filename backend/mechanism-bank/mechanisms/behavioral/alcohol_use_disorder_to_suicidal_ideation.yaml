direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to chronic alcohol intoxication and pathological
  use patterns, which impair cognitive function and emotional regulation'
- 'Step 2: Impaired judgment and disinhibition from alcohol use increases negative
  thought patterns and reduces capacity to cope with stressors'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol use exacerbates depression, anxiety, and hopelessness through
  neurobiological effects on mood-regulating neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 4: Social consequences of alcohol use disorder (relationship problems, occupational
  difficulties, social isolation) compound psychological distress'
- 'Step 5: The combination of impaired cognition, emotional dysregulation, and accumulated
  psychosocial stressors increases susceptibility to suicidal ideation'

description: Systematic review of 108 studies in low- and middle-income countries
  demonstrates a consistent positive association between alcohol use disorder and
  suicidal ideation. The relationship holds across all dimensions of alcohol use (intoxication,
  use, and pathological use) and is observed across diverse LMIC settings. Alcohol
  use disorder functions as a potentially modifiable risk factor for suicidal ideation,
  operating through behavioral, neurobiological, and psychosocial pathways.
