mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption contributes to development and progression of chronic
  pancreatitis through direct toxic effects on pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Chronic pancreatitis leads to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and malabsorption
  of fat-soluble vitamins (D and K)'
- 'Step 3: Vitamin D and K deficiencies impair calcium absorption and bone metabolism'
- 'Step 4: Chronic malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies result in decreased bone
  mineral density and osteopathy'
