description: Participants with harmful alcohol use patterns were significantly less likely to support
  evidence-based alcohol control measures. This represents a potential structural barrier to policy implementation
  where those most affected may oppose interventions.

  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how alcohol industry interests align with heavy drinkers
    to create political opposition to public health policy. A structural approach recognizes that harmful
    drinking is produced by commercial and policy environments, not individual moral failure, even as
    those environments create constituencies opposing change.
