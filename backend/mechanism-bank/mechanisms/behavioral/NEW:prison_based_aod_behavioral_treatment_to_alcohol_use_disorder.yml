structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol use disorder among incarcerated populations reflects upstream structural
    factors including economic stress, trauma exposure, limited mental health services, and marketing
    practices by alcohol industry. The link between alcohol use and crime noted in the review points to
    how substance use policy and criminal justice policy intersect. Addressing alcohol-related health
    disparities requires attention to these structural drivers rather than individual-level interventions
    alone.
