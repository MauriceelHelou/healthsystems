  node_name: Male Infertility - Semen Quality Impairment
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains reactive oxygen species and heavy metals that accumulate in seminal
  plasma'
- 'Step 2: Oxidative stress damages sperm DNA, cell membranes, and mitochondrial function'
- 'Step 3: Toxic compounds disrupt spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules'
- 'Step 4: Resulting reduction in sperm concentration, motility, and morphology leads to male infertility'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While framed as individual behavior, tobacco use is shaped by structural factors
    including tobacco industry marketing, socioeconomic stress, lack of cessation support, and occupational
    exposure. Low-income and marginalized communities face disproportionate tobacco advertising and fewer
    resources for cessation. Reproductive health consequences thus reflect structural inequities in tobacco
    control policy implementation.
