mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with serious mental illness have substantially elevated smoking rates compared
  to general population'
- 'Step 2: Psychiatric inpatient facilities have increasingly implemented smoke-free policies'
- 'Step 3: Enforced abstinence during psychiatric hospitalization does not address underlying nicotine
  dependence without dedicated support'
- 'Step 4: Post-discharge from mental health facilities, individuals return to smoking without continuity
  of cessation care'
- 'Step 5: High smoking prevalence in SMI populations contributes to reduced life expectancy and excess
  cardiovascular mortality'

description: People with serious mental illness who experience smoking bans during psychiatric hospitalization
  often relapse to smoking shortly after discharge. This population has particularly high smoking rates
  and requires integrated cessation support throughout the care continuum.

  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the major health equity issue of tobacco-related mortality
    disparity in people with serious mental illness. The 15-25 year life expectancy gap for people with
    SMI is largely driven by preventable conditions including tobacco-related diseases. Healthcare systems
    have historically neglected tobacco cessation in mental health settings due to misconceptions about
    patient capacity to quit and concerns about psychiatric stability. Addressing this requires structural
    changes in how mental healthcare integrates tobacco treatment.
