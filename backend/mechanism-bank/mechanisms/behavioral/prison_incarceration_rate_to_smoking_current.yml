- 'Step 1: Smoke-free prison policies enforce temporary smoking abstinence during incarceration'
- 'Step 2: Upon release, formerly incarcerated individuals return to environments with high smoking prevalence
  and tobacco availability'
- 'Step 3: Lack of pre-release and post-release smoking cessation support leads to high relapse rates'
- 'Step 4: Social networks and stress associated with reentry facilitate return to smoking behavior'

description: This systematic review examines factors influencing smoking behaviors among people released
  from smoke-free prisons. High smoking relapse rates occur following release, despite enforced abstinence
  during incarceration. Interventions delivered both pre- and post-release that strengthen quit intentions,
  integrate with substance use treatment, and facilitate social support may help maintain abstinence.

  variation_notes: Evidence base is almost exclusively US-based, limiting generalizability to other contexts
    where smoke-free prison policies are proliferating internationally

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how correctional system policies (smoke-free prisons)
    create temporary abstinence that is not sustained due to lack of structural support during reentry.
    The focus is appropriately on system-level interventions rather than individual blame. The formerly
    incarcerated population faces compounded vulnerabilities including limited healthcare access, economic
    instability, and disrupted social networks that increase smoking relapse risk. The findings emphasize
    the need for coordinated pre- and post-release support systems rather than expecting individual behavior
    change without structural support.
