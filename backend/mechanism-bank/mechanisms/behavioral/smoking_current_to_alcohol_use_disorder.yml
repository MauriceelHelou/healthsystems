direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smoking and alcohol use share common neurobiological reward pathways involving dopamine release'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine may enhance the reinforcing effects of alcohol through cross-sensitization mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Social environments that normalize smoking often also normalize heavy drinking'
- 'Step 4: Shared genetic and environmental risk factors predispose individuals to both behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Co-use patterns lead to increased alcohol consumption and higher risk of developing AUD'

description: Smoking is a significant determinant of alcohol use disorder in East Asian adult populations.
  Current smokers have nearly 4 times the odds of developing AUD compared to non-smokers, reflecting shared
  biological vulnerability, social environmental factors, and behavioral co-occurrence patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural factors including tobacco and alcohol industry
    marketing practices, cultural norms around substance use in East Asian societies, and limited integration
    of tobacco-alcohol treatment services. The co-occurrence suggests need for comprehensive substance
    use policies rather than siloed interventions. Workplace cultures and social drinking norms in some
    East Asian countries may reinforce both behaviors.
