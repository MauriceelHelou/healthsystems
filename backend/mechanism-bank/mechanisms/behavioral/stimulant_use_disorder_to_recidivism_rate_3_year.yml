- 'Step 4: Drug-related offenses and associated criminal activity lead to rearrest and reincarceration'

description: Pre-criminal justice system methamphetamine use is associated with increased risk of recidivism
  after CJS contact. Four studies in this systematic review demonstrated this association, with additional
  evidence showing higher crime costs among those with pre-CJS methamphetamine use.

  description: Authors recommend prioritizing treatment during CJS contact to reduce recidivism, suggesting
    treatment access moderates this relationship
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural failures in providing adequate substance use
    treatment within the criminal justice system. Rather than treating addiction as a health condition,
    punitive approaches fail to address root causes. Lack of reentry services, treatment access, and social
    support post-release perpetuates cycles of incarceration. Structural interventions including drug
    courts, treatment alternatives, and reentry services could interrupt this pathway.
