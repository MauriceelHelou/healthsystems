mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood sexual abuse causes severe psychological trauma, disrupting normal
  emotional development and attachment patterns'
- 'Step 2: Trauma leads to difficulties in emotional regulation, including heightened
  stress reactivity and maladaptive coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Survivors may develop dissociative symptoms, feelings of worthlessness,
  shame, and self-blame as psychological sequelae'
- 'Step 4: These psychological effects increase vulnerability to mental health disorders
  including depression and anxiety'
- 'Step 5: Self-harm emerges as a maladaptive coping strategy to regulate overwhelming
  emotions, express psychological pain, or regain sense of control'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis using burden of proof methodology
  found a moderate association between childhood sexual abuse and self-harm, with
  35% increased risk. The relationship is classified as behavioral, operating through
  trauma-induced psychological dysfunction and maladaptive coping mechanisms. Self-harm
  serves as an emotional regulation strategy for survivors experiencing overwhelming
  distress.
