mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Summer holiday programs provide structured activities during school vacation periods when children
  typically have increased unstructured time'
- 'Step 2: Programs offer organized physical activities, scheduled programming, and supervised engagement
  that replace passive leisure time'
- 'Step 3: Reduced time spent in sedentary activities (screen time, sitting) as children participate in
  program-based activities'
- 'Step 4: Structured environment limits opportunities for extended sedentary behavior that typically
  increases during summer months'

description: Summer holiday programs demonstrate a significant moderate effect on reducing sedentary behavior
  in school-aged children (g=-0.59). During summer vacation, children typically experience unfavorable
  changes in health behaviors including increased sedentary time. Structured programs provide alternatives
  to passive leisure activities.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural factors related to the built environment and
    social infrastructure for children during non-school periods. Summer programs represent a structural
    intervention that addresses the gap in supervised physical activity opportunities when schools are
    closed. Access to such programs may vary by socioeconomic status and geographic location, potentially
    contributing to health inequities if availability is unequal across communities.
