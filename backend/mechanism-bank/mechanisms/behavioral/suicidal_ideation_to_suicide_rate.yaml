direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Suicidal ideation emerges as persistent thoughts about self-harm or ending
  one''s life, often in the context of mental health conditions, psychosocial stressors,
  or crisis situations'
- 'Step 2: Suicidal ideation, when untreated or unaddressed, may progress in intensity
  and specificity, potentially involving planning and intent formation'
- 'Step 3: The presence of suicidal ideation increases the probability of suicide
  attempts and completed suicide, with a moderate but significant association (OR
  = 3.11)'

description: Suicidal ideation is moderately but significantly associated with later
  completed suicide, with individuals experiencing suicidal ideation having approximately
  three times the odds of dying by suicide compared to those without such ideation.
  This meta-analysis of 51 studies demonstrates that suicidal ideation should not
  be deprioritized relative to suicidal behavior when assessing suicide risk, as both
  represent important clinical warning signs.
