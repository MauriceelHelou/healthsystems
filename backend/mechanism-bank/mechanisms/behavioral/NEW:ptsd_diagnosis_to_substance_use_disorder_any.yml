category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PTSD involves dysregulation of stress response systems and hyperarousal symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Individuals may use substances as self-medication to manage intrusive thoughts, hypervigilance,
  and emotional numbing'
- 'Step 3: Chronic substance use leads to neurobiological adaptations and dependence'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring disorders create reciprocal worsening cycles with worse health outcomes than either
  condition alone'

description: PTSD and substance use disorders commonly co-occur, with this comorbidity associated with
  worse health outcomes than either condition alone. The systematic review identified 29 studies examining
  16 pharmacotherapies for this co-occurring population.

  description: Many studies focused on veteran population, which may have different trauma exposure patterns
    and healthcare access through VA system
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The review highlights structural barriers to treatment access as a key concern
    - noting that while psychosocial therapies are recommended, they come with 'numerous barriers to access
    and engagement.' This points to healthcare system failures rather than individual non-compliance.
    The concentration of research on veterans reflects structural investment patterns in military healthcare
    that may not generalize to civilian populations who lack equivalent access.
