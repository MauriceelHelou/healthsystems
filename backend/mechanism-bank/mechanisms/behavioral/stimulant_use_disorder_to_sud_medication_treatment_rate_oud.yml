direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Co-use of stimulants and opioids creates polysubstance use patterns that complicate treatment
  initiation'
- 'Step 2: Stimulant use may interfere with completing required detoxification or stabilization periods
  before MOUD initiation'
- 'Step 3: Treatment programs may have structural barriers or exclusion criteria for patients with active
  stimulant use'
- 'Step 4: Reduced likelihood of initiating buprenorphine or extended-release naltrexone treatment among
  people with OUD'

description: Stimulant use reduces the likelihood of initiating medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)
  including buprenorphine and extended-release naltrexone by 32% in clinical trial populations. This barrier
  to treatment is particularly pronounced for XR-NTX initiation and among rural populations who inject
  drugs.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers to OUD treatment for people with
    polysubstance use. Rather than blaming individuals for stimulant use, the finding points to treatment
    system limitations that fail to accommodate the complex needs of people with co-occurring stimulant
    and opioid use disorders. Rural populations face compounded structural disadvantages including limited
    MOUD access and higher barriers to XR-NTX initiation. The finding calls for interventions addressing
    stimulant use among OUD patients and expanded treatment capacity in underserved areas.
