mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Armed conflict creates conditions for depression through trauma, loss, and displacement'
- 'Step 2: Depression in conflict settings often goes untreated due to destroyed or inadequate mental
  health infrastructure'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with depression experience anhedonia, hopelessness, and emotional pain requiring
  relief'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol provides temporary anxiolytic and mood-altering effects that self-medicate depressive
  symptoms'
- 'Step 5: Repeated self-medication establishes patterns of harmful alcohol use and potential alcohol
  use disorder'

description: Depression was identified as a factor associated with harmful alcohol use among conflict-affected
  populations in low- and middle-income countries. This represents a comorbidity pathway where untreated
  depression in conflict settings increases risk for harmful alcohol use as a self-medication strategy.

  variation_notes: The depression-alcohol pathway may be modified by cultural attitudes toward both mental
    illness and alcohol use across different LMIC regions

  description: Access to mental health treatment for depression would likely weaken the self-medication
    pathway to alcohol use, though no intervention studies were identified
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism connects depression to alcohol use through the structural lens of
    destroyed or inadequate mental health systems in conflict-affected LMICs. Rather than framing this
    as individual comorbidity, the pathway emphasizes how conflict creates both the conditions for depression
    and the treatment gap that leads to harmful self-medication with alcohol. The absence of intervention
    studies noted in the review reflects systemic neglect of both mental health and substance use services
    in humanitarian responses.
