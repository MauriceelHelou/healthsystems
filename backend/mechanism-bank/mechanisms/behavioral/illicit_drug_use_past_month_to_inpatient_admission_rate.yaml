direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Illicit drug use (heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine, etc.) leads to
  acute and chronic health complications including overdose, infections, cardiovascular
  events, and respiratory problems'
- 'Step 2: Drug injection practices increase risk of bloodborne infections (HIV, hepatitis),
  injection site infections, and endocarditis requiring hospitalization'
- 'Step 3: Co-occurring factors among people who use drugs (unstable housing, mental
  health problems) compound health vulnerability and care-seeking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated health problems and acute crises result in hospital admissions
  at rates approximately 7.1 times higher than the general population'

description: People who use illicit drugs are admitted to hospital approximately 7.1
  times more often than the general population, with a pooled rate of 41 per 100 person-years.
  This elevated hospitalization rate is driven by direct drug-related complications
  (overdose, intoxication), indirect health consequences (infections, cardiovascular
  and respiratory problems), and compounding social vulnerabilities. The association
  is strongest among those using heroin, methamphetamine, or crack cocaine, and those
  with drug dependence diagnoses.
