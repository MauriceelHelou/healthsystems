direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder frequently co-occurs with housing instability and homelessness due to
  structural barriers to housing access'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol use impairs immune system function and wound healing capacity'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol use disorder may reduce attention to personal hygiene and self-care behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Impaired judgment and social marginalization increase exposure to environments with higher
  vector density'
- 'Step 5: Combined immunosuppression and increased exposure elevate risk of B. quintana infection and
  seroconversion'

description: Alcoholism was identified as one of three key susceptibility factors for Bartonella quintana
  infection among homeless populations in this systematic review. The relationship between alcohol use
  disorder and infectious disease susceptibility reflects both biological (immunosuppression) and structural
  (housing instability, reduced healthcare access) pathways.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While alcoholism is identified as a risk factor, this should be understood through
    a structural lens: alcohol use disorder often develops in contexts of trauma, economic hardship, and
    social marginalization. Those with alcohol use disorder face systematic barriers to housing, healthcare,
    and hygiene facilities. Effective interventions must address both addiction treatment access AND structural
    supports including housing-first programs and harm reduction services, rather than blaming individuals
    for their substance use.'
