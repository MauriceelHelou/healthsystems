direction: positive
category: occupational_health
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CHDs must maintain constant alertness and rapid decision-making under pressure'
- 'Step 2: Unpredictable nature of emergency calls creates chronic hypervigilance'
- 'Step 3: Fear of making errors with life-or-death consequences produces anticipatory anxiety'
- 'Step 4: Sustained physiological stress response leads to clinical anxiety disorders'

  description: Higher call volumes and understaffing may increase anxiety risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Anxiety prevalence reflects job design factors including high cognitive demands,
    time pressure, and consequences of errors. Structural interventions should address workload management,
    adequate break times, and technology improvements rather than placing burden on individual coping.
