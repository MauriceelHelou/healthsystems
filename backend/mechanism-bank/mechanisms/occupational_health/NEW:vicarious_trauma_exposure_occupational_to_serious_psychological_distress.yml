- 'Step 1: CHDs receive detailed accounts of traumatic events including violence, accidents, and medical
  emergencies'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure without direct involvement creates secondary traumatic stress through empathic
  engagement'
- 'Step 3: Accumulation of vicarious trauma leads to cognitive intrusions, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal'
- 'Step 4: Chronic traumatic stress manifests as serious psychological distress across multiple domains'

description: CHDs are exposed to vicarious trauma through emergency calls, leading to elevated rates of
  PTSD (17.8%), depression (28.2%), anxiety (17.2%), and hazardous drinking (17.8%). This represents a
  structural occupational hazard requiring systemic intervention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism pathway from occupation to psychological distress is fundamentally
    structural - it results from job design, staffing decisions, and organizational support (or lack thereof).
    The abstract explicitly calls for research to 'guide appropriate psychological support,' recognizing
    the need for organizational rather than individual intervention. Equity implications include recognition
    that CHDs are often not classified as first responders and may lack access to mental health benefits
    available to police, fire, and EMS personnel.
