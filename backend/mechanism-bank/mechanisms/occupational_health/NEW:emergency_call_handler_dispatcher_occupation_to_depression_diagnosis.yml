  description: Adequate psychological support programs may reduce depression risk among CHDs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Depression prevalence of over one-quarter of workers indicates systemic occupational
    health failure rather than individual susceptibility. Structural interventions needed include mandatory
    psychological support, adequate staffing to prevent overwork, and recognition of CHDs as first responders
    for purposes of mental health benefits.
