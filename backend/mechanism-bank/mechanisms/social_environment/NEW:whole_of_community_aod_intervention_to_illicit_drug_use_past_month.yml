description: Whole-of-community interventions showed no significant effect on 12-month marijuana use (RR=0.98,
  95% CI 0.86-1.11). This null finding suggests that interventions designed primarily for alcohol may
  not translate effectively to other substance use without specific targeting.

  description: Many whole-of-community interventions may focus primarily on alcohol rather than other
    drugs, potentially limiting effectiveness for marijuana use
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of effect on marijuana use highlights that structural interventions may
    need to be substance-specific. Cannabis use operates within different social, legal, and commercial
    contexts than alcohol, requiring tailored policy and environmental approaches. This finding does not
    suggest individual blame but rather the need for appropriately targeted structural interventions.
