description: Perception of health-related risks during pandemic identified as primary antecedent contributing
  to job insecurity among workers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Health risks at work are structural in nature, determined by occupational conditions,
    workplace safety policies, and employer responses to pandemic. Essential workers and those unable
    to work remotely faced disproportionate exposure to both health risks and subsequent job insecurity.
