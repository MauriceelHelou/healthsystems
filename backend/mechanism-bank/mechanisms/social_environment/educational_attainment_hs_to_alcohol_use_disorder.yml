- 'Step 1: Educational attainment serves as a structural pathway linking cognitive ability to social and
  economic outcomes'
- 'Step 2: Higher education provides access to social networks, employment, and resources that may be
  protective against AUD'
- 'Step 3: Educational environments may shape health literacy and decision-making regarding substance
  use'
- 'Step 4: The mediating role of education varies by national context, suggesting structural/policy influences
  on this pathway'

description: Educational attainment mediates the relationship between cognitive performance and alcohol
  use disorder risk, but this mediating effect varies by national context. This suggests that structural
  factors including educational policy, social welfare systems, and cultural factors influence how cognitive
  ability translates into AUD risk through educational pathways.

  description: The relationship between education and AUD varied significantly between Swedish and US
    contexts, suggesting that national educational policies, healthcare systems, and social safety nets
    modify this pathway
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This finding directly implicates structural factors: national educational systems,
    social policies, and economic contexts shape how individual cognitive capacity translates into health
    outcomes. Countries with stronger social safety nets, more accessible education, and universal healthcare
    may buffer the IQ-AUD relationship differently. This supports policy-level interventions rather than
    individual-level blame. Equity implications include recognizing that educational access disparities
    by race and class may contribute to differential AUD burden.'
