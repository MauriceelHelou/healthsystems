mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower AA involvement indicates less engagement with abstinence-focused mutual help organizations'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with occasional heavy drinking may not align with AA''s abstinence-based philosophy'
- 'Step 3: Alternative social support systems or recovery capital may substitute for AA involvement'
- 'Step 4: High psychosocial functioning achieved through pathways other than traditional 12-step involvement'

  equity_implications: Access to mutual help organizations like AA varies by geography, with rural areas
    having fewer meetings. The finding that high functioning is possible with lower AA involvement suggests
    need for diverse recovery support options beyond traditional 12-step approaches.
