description: Transfeminine adults show elevated risk for drug use-related disorders compared to transmasculine
  adults, reflecting the differential impact of minority stress. The Minority Stress Model explains how
  exposure to violence and discrimination drives substance use as a coping mechanism in stigmatized communities.

  description: Transfeminine participants were 1.64 times more likely to be diagnosed with drug use-related
    disorders compared to transmasculine participants
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism locates the cause of drug use disorders in structural discrimination
    rather than individual choice. The disparities between transfeminine and transmasculine groups reflect
    differential exposure to violence and discrimination, not inherent differences in the populations.
