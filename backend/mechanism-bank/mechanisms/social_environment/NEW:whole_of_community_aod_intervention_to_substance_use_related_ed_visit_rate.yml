description: Narrative synthesis found equivocal evidence for whole-of-community intervention effects
  on motor vehicle accidents and hospital admissions. While significant reductions were found for risky
  drinking, these did not consistently translate to reduced healthcare utilization for AOD-related harms.

  description: More intensive and comprehensive interventions across more settings may have greater impact
    on downstream health outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The disconnect between reduced risky drinking and unchanged hospital admissions
    may reflect the complexity of translating behavior change to healthcare utilization outcomes. Structural
    factors beyond the intervention, such as healthcare access, injury severity thresholds, and reporting
    practices, may moderate the pathway from reduced consumption to reduced ED visits. This highlights
    that comprehensive health equity approaches require attention to multiple structural determinants.
