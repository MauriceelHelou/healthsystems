description: Intimate partner violence exposure leads to stress-coping alcohol use
  through a self-medication pathway. IPV creates psychological trauma and chronic
  stress that triggers maladaptive coping mechanisms. Victims use alcohol as a means
  to manage emotional distress, PTSD symptoms, and psychological pain resulting from
  the violence. This relationship is supported by longitudinal evidence showing that
  IPV exposure temporally precedes drinking to cope behaviors, which subsequently
  lead to problematic alcohol use patterns.
structural_competency_notes: This mechanism reflects broader structural inequalities
  including gender-based power imbalances, limited access to mental health services,
  and social norms that may normalize both IPV and alcohol use as coping mechanisms.
  Economic constraints and social isolation often accompanying IPV may further limit
  access to healthier coping resources and professional support.
