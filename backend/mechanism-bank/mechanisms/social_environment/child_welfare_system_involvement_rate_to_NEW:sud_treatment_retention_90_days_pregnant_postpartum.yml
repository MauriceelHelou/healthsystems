mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Active CPS involvement creates external accountability structure requiring demonstrated treatment
  engagement'
- 'Step 2: Women with CPS cases face potential custody consequences providing motivation for treatment
  adherence'
- 'Step 3: CPS involvement may facilitate access to wraparound services and case management support'
- 'Step 4: Extended treatment duration (≥90 days) allows for stabilization and development of recovery
  skills'

description: Active CPS involvement during SUD treatment admission was significantly associated with increased
  likelihood of spending at least 90 days in treatment among pregnant and postpartum women. Women with
  active CPS cases were 78% more likely to remain in treatment for the recommended minimum duration compared
  to those without CPS involvement.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the complex relationship between child welfare systems
    and healthcare. While CPS involvement appears to support treatment retention, this must be understood
    within a structural context where pregnant women with SUD face criminalization and family separation.
    The finding suggests that system involvement can provide scaffolding for treatment engagement, but
    raises questions about whether punitive threat versus supportive services drive this effect. Equity
    implications include potential differential CPS involvement by race and socioeconomic status, which
    could create disparate treatment pathways.
