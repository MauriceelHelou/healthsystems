category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fixed-site healthcare settings often embed stigma and judgment toward individuals
  with opioid use disorder through provider attitudes, policies, and physical environments'
- 'Step 2: Stigmatizing experiences create psychological distress, shame, and anticipation
  of discrimination when seeking treatment'
- 'Step 3: Anticipated and experienced stigma acts as a barrier to initial engagement
  and ongoing participation in MOUD treatment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment engagement leads to lower retention and poorer recovery
  outcomes'
