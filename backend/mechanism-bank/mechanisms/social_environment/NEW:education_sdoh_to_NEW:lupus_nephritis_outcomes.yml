direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower educational attainment associated with reduced health literacy and disease understanding'
- 'Step 2: Limited understanding of disease management reduces ability to recognize warning signs and
  adhere to complex treatment regimens'
- 'Step 3: Educational disadvantage correlates with reduced economic opportunity and healthcare access'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative disadvantage leads to suboptimal disease control and progression'

description: Educational attainment as an SDoH domain affects lupus nephritis outcomes through health
  literacy, disease understanding, and intersection with economic opportunity

  description: Patient education and health literacy programs may mitigate effects of educational disadvantage
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Educational disparities reflect structural inequities in school funding, opportunity,
    and historical exclusion rather than individual effort or ability. Healthcare systems should adapt
    communication and support to varying health literacy levels rather than expecting patients to meet
    educational prerequisites for self-management.
