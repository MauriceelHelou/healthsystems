mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower parental education is associated with reduced health literacy and healthcare navigation
  skills'
- 'Step 2: Parents with lower education may have less ability to advocate for comprehensive care'
- 'Step 3: Educational disparities intersect with other socioeconomic factors affecting healthcare access'
- 'Step 4: Differential quality of trauma care and follow-up received by children'

  equity_implications: While education is an individual-level factor, this mechanism recognizes that educational
    disparities result from structural inequities in educational opportunity. The focus on system navigation
    emphasizes structural barriers rather than blaming parents.
