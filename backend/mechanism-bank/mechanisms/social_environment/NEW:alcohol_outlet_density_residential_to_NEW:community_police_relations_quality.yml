mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High alcohol outlet density associated with increased crime and disorder calls'
- 'Step 2: Increased police presence and enforcement activity in areas around outlets'
- 'Step 3: Frequent police-community interactions in enforcement contexts strain relationships'
- 'Step 4: Community members identified community-police relations as key factor in policy success'

description: Stakeholders identified community-police relations as a key contextual factor affecting whether
  alcohol outlet zoning policy achieves its crime reduction goals, suggesting a feedback loop between
  outlet density, policing, and community trust.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how place-based alcohol policy intersects with policing
    and criminal justice systems. The emphasis on community-police relations by stakeholders reflects
    awareness that enforcement-based approaches to alcohol-related crime in Baltimore (a predominantly
    Black city with documented history of police-community tensions) require attention to structural racism
    in policing. The participatory methodology centered community voice in identifying these structural
    dynamics.
