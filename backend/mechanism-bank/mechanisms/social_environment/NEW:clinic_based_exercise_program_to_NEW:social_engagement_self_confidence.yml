structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare infrastructure can be leveraged to address
    social isolation and stigma experienced by people receiving OAT. By embedding exercise within trusted
    clinical settings, structural barriers related to stigma and access are reduced, potentially decreasing
    health disparities in this marginalized population.
