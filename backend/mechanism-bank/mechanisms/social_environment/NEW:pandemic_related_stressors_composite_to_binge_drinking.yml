mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic introduces multiple concurrent stressors (job loss, household composition
  changes, essential worker status)'
- 'Step 2: Stressors disrupt daily routines, economic security, and social relationships'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to typical stress-relief outlets (gyms, social gatherings, recreation) during
  lockdown'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol becomes more accessible relative to other coping mechanisms while confined at home'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative stress exposure increases probability of binge drinking as coping response'

description: Thirty-four percent of the sample reported binge drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic, with
  specific COVID-19-related stressors (household composition, job status, essential worker status, stay-at-home
  duration, depression) associated with changes in alcohol consumption. This demonstrates how structural
  disruption from pandemic response measures creates conditions conducive to harmful alcohol use.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers structural causation by identifying how pandemic policies
    and economic disruption - not individual moral failings - drive alcohol consumption changes. Job loss
    is a structural economic outcome, not a personal choice. Essential worker designation reflects labor
    market position and economic necessity. The study explicitly identifies 'ancillary and unintended
    effects' of pandemic response, framing the issue as a policy consequence requiring structural solutions.
    Equity implications include disproportionate burden on workers in precarious employment and those
    lacking economic buffers.
