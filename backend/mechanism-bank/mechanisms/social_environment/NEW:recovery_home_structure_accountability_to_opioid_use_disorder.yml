  equity_implications: The Social Model of Recovery explicitly frames recovery as a community and environmental
    phenomenon rather than individual pathology. This structural approach recognizes that stable housing,
    peer support infrastructure, and organizational policies are necessary conditions for recovery, shifting
    focus from individual blame to systemic supports.
