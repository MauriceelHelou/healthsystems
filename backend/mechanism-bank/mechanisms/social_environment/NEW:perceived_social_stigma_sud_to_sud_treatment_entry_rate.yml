mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal stigmatization of substance use disorders is pervasive globally'
- 'Step 2: Individuals anticipate discrimination and negative judgment if they seek treatment'
- 'Step 3: Stigma creates structural and psychological barriers to accessing formal treatment services'
- 'Step 4: Fear of stigma leads to delayed or avoided treatment seeking'
- 'Step 5: Reduced treatment entry rates result from stigma-related barriers to care'

description: While the review primarily focuses on treatment outcomes among those already in treatment,
  the background establishes that stigma creates barriers to treatment entry. SUDs are noted to be highly
  stigmatized worldwide, and qualitative evidence confirms stigma experiences negatively impact feelings
  and beliefs about treatment, which would logically extend to treatment-seeking behavior.

  variation_notes: Abstract notes SUDs are highly stigmatized worldwide, implying global phenomenon with
    potential local variation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment entry barriers from stigma reflect structural failures in how healthcare
    systems and society approach addiction. The criminalization of drug use, moralization of addiction,
    and lack of confidentiality protections create rational fears about seeking help. Equity implications
    include that individuals in communities with less access to anonymous treatment options or those in
    professions with mandatory reporting face additional structural barriers. Policy solutions include
    decriminalization, confidentiality protections, and integration of SUD treatment into mainstream healthcare
    to reduce 'othering.'
