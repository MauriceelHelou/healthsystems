direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Divorce/separation creates acute psychological distress and disrupts social
  support systems, triggering stress-response mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Loss of spousal social control and monitoring removes protective factors
  against excessive drinking, while increased social isolation and emotional dysregulation
  emerge'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol becomes a maladaptive coping mechanism for managing divorce-related
  stress, loneliness, and life disruption, leading to problematic drinking patterns
  and AUD development'

description: Divorce and separation significantly increase the risk of alcohol use
  disorder through multiple interconnected pathways. The dissolution of marriage creates
  acute psychological stress while simultaneously removing the protective social control
  and monitoring functions that spouses provide. This dual impact - increased stress
  exposure combined with reduced protective factors - creates conditions that promote
  problematic drinking. The mechanism involves both immediate stress-response reactions
  and longer-term adaptational challenges, with alcohol serving as a readily available
  but maladaptive coping strategy for managing emotional distress, loneliness, and
  life disruption.
structural_competency_notes: The relationship between divorce/separation and alcohol
  use disorder reflects broader structural inequalities in social support systems,
  economic stability, and access to mental health resources. Divorced individuals
  often experience reduced economic resources, social isolation, and limited access
  to alternative coping mechanisms, particularly affecting women and marginalized
  populations who may face additional barriers to social and economic support following
  relationship dissolution.
