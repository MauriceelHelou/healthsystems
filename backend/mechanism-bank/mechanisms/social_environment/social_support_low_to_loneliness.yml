description: The review found that quality of relationships is a correlate and predictor of loneliness
  among people with substance use problems, emphasizing the importance of relationship quality over mere
  quantity of social contacts.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Quality of relationships for people with substance use problems is shaped by structural
    factors including availability of peer support services, recovery housing, and community-based treatment
    programs that facilitate healthy social connections. Limited investment in these structural supports
    perpetuates isolation.
