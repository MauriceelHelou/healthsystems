- 'Step 1: Recovery narratives provide structured personal stories that normalize the recovery process'
- 'Step 2: Narrative frameworks characterize key dimensions including identity transformation and drinking
  trajectories'

- 'Step 4: Shared recovery experiences create social support networks and reduce isolation'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced self-efficacy and hope contribute to sustained alcohol recovery'

description: 'Recovery narratives serve as a mechanism for alcohol recovery through eight principal dimensions:
  genre, identity, recovery setting, drinking trajectories, drinking behaviors and traits, stages, spirituality
  and religion, and recovery experience. The conceptual framework was validated and extended through qualitative
  interviews with individuals in alcohol recovery.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The study recognizes that recovery narratives are shaped by structural factors
    including socioeconomic background. The framework's dimensions (recovery setting, identity) implicitly
    acknowledge that recovery resources and pathways are unequally distributed across social positions.
    The inclusion of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in sampling reflects awareness that structural
    position influences recovery experience. However, the study focuses primarily on individual narrative
    dimensions rather than explicitly analyzing how structural barriers (housing instability, employment,
    healthcare access) shape recovery trajectories.
