- 'Step 2: Lack of stable address complicates medication storage, appointment attendance, and follow-up
  contact'
- 'Step 3: 16% of study participants were unhoused, representing vulnerable population with complex needs'
- 'Step 4: Housing instability may contribute to treatment discontinuation despite low-barrier clinic
  access'

description: Housing instability among 16% of bridge clinic patients represents a structural barrier to
  sustained SUD treatment engagement, as competing survival needs and logistical challenges associated
  with homelessness interfere with care continuity.

    value: 16.0
    type: percentage_change

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Urban setting with 16% unhoused; rates vary significantly by geography and housing
    market conditions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The intersection of housing instability and SUD exemplifies how structural factors
    compound health vulnerabilities. Rather than viewing housing instability as individual failure, this
    highlights how lack of affordable housing and social safety net creates conditions that perpetuate
    both homelessness and substance use disorders.
