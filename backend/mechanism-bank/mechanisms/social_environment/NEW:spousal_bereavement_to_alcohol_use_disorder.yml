description: This systematic review found that death of a spouse or close relative does NOT increase risk
  for late-onset AUD or heavy drinking. This null finding challenges common clinical assumptions about
  bereavement and alcohol use in older adults.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This null finding is important for avoiding stigmatizing bereaved older adults
    as at-risk for alcohol problems. The review highlights that preconceptions about older adult drinking
    have dominated the field since the 1970s, leading to potentially harmful stereotyping. This underscores
    the need for evidence-based rather than assumption-based approaches to understanding late-onset AUD.
