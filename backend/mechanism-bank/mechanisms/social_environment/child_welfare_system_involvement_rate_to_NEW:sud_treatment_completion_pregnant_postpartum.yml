description: Active CPS involvement showed a trend toward higher rates of treatment completion (RR = 1.41),
  though this finding did not reach statistical significance. The 95% confidence interval crossing 1.0
  indicates uncertainty about whether CPS involvement truly improves completion rates versus retention
  duration alone.

  equity_implications: The non-significant finding for completion despite significant retention suggests
    structural barriers may persist even with extended treatment engagement. This could reflect systemic
    issues in treatment program design, inadequate duration of support services, or the complexity of
    recovery from SUD during pregnancy/postpartum period. Policy implications include need for both retention-focused
    and completion-focused interventions that address structural determinants of treatment success.
