direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Older adults'' social networks include peers who approve of or normalize drinking'
- 'Step 2: Social approval reduces perceived risk and stigma of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Social drinking occasions become more frequent in permissive peer environments'
- 'Step 4: Normalization leads to increased consumption levels over time'
- 'Step 5: Development of late-onset alcohol use disorder or heavy drinking patterns'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Social norms around drinking are structurally shaped by cultural factors, marketing,
    availability of alcohol-free social spaces, and community resources for older adults. The mechanism
    recognizes that individual behavior is embedded in social context. Equity implications include differential
    exposure to drinking-normative environments based on community resources and social capital.
