description: Exposure to alcohol-sponsored events and promotional activities showed particularly consistent
  positive associations with youth alcohol use behaviors compared to other advertising channels. Sponsorship
  creates embedded marketing that links alcohol consumption with valued social and recreational activities.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how commercial interests shape the social environment
    through event sponsorship strategies. Rather than blaming youth for alcohol use, it traces the problem
    to industry marketing practices that infiltrate social spaces frequented by young people. Policy implications
    include restricting alcohol sponsorship of events with significant youth audiences.
