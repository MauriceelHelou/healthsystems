description: Study findings highlight extensive trauma histories among women in SUD treatment, indicating
  trauma as a structural pathway to substance use disorders. This aligns with literature on ACEs and addiction
  vulnerability.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 217
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces SUD to structural trauma exposure rather than individual
    moral failing. Women in SUD treatment have extensive trauma histories, suggesting prevention efforts
    should address upstream trauma prevention and trauma-informed care approaches. The emphasis on emotion
    regulation as treatment target shifts focus from substance-focused interventions to addressing underlying
    regulatory capacity affected by trauma.
