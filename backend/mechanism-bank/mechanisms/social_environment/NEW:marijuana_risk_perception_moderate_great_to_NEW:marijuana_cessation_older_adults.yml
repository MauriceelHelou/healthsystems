category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public health messaging and social norms shape perceptions of marijuana risk'
- 'Step 2: Older adults with higher risk perceptions are motivated to reduce use'
- 'Step 3: Risk perception influences decision-making about continued versus discontinued use'
- 'Step 4: Higher risk perception increases likelihood of transitioning from use to nonuse'

description: Moderate/great marijuana risk perceptions were associated with higher likelihood of both
  use-to-nonuse and initiation/reinitiation, suggesting complex relationships between risk perception
  and use patterns.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Risk perceptions are shaped by structural factors including public health campaigns,
    media coverage, and information environment. The finding that high risk perception was associated
    with both cessation AND initiation/reinitiation suggests that risk perception alone is insufficient
    to prevent use and that other structural factors may be more determinative.
