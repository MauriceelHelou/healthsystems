direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women with disabilities experience significant social marginalization and
  reduced autonomy in developing country contexts'
- 'Step 2: Marginalization intersects with partner behaviors (alcohol consumption,
  witnessing parental violence) and socioeconomic factors (occupation, wealth) to
  increase vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Reduced power dynamics and dependency relationships within intimate partnerships
  create conditions where women with disabilities face higher risk of sexual coercion
  and violence'
- 'Step 4: Women with disabilities in specific occupational categories (agriculture,
  manual work) and wealth quintiles experience compounded risk compared to non-disabled
  women in similar categories'

description: Women with disabilities face 51% higher adjusted odds of experiencing
  sexual intimate partner violence compared to women without disabilities. This association
  operates through multiple intersecting pathways including social marginalization,
  reduced autonomy, partner behavioral factors, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.
  Sexual IPV prevalence was 25% among women with disabilities compared to 18% among
  those without disabilities.
