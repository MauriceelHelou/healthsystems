mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with low social support lack access to informal safety nets
  (family, friends) that could provide temporary housing, financial assistance, or
  emotional support during housing crises'
- 'Step 2: Without social network resources to buffer against economic shocks (job
  loss, medical expenses, eviction), individuals are more vulnerable to losing stable
  housing'
- 'Step 3: Once homeless, individuals with weak social networks have fewer pathways
  back to stable housing and may experience chronic homelessness due to limited community
  integration support'
- 'Step 4: The absence of social support creates a reinforcing cycle where homelessness
  further erodes existing social connections, making exit from homelessness more difficult'

description: This systematic review of 29 studies demonstrates that social support
  plays a key role in housing experiences and outcomes among individuals experiencing
  chronic homelessness. Nearly all included studies found that changes in social support
  were associated with housing interventions, and evidence indicates intervention
  effects on social support are largely positive. The findings suggest that low social
  support both contributes to becoming homeless and perpetuates chronic homelessness
  by limiting pathways to community integration and stable housing.
