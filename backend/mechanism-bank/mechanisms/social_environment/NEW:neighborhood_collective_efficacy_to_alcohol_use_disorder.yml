mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Collective efficacy encompasses social cohesion and informal social control within neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Higher collective efficacy theoretically reduces tolerance for disruptive behaviors including
  excessive drinking'
- 'Step 3: Social cohesion may provide alternative coping resources reducing reliance on alcohol'
- 'Step 4: However, in this study, collective efficacy did NOT significantly mediate neighborhood disadvantage
  effects on AUD'

description: The hypothesized mediating role of collective efficacy (social cohesion and social control)
  between neighborhood disadvantage and alcohol outcomes was NOT supported in this study. The direct effect
  of collective efficacy on alcohol-related outcomes was not statistically significant.

  variation_notes: Null mediation finding specific to Puerto Rico; authors suggest family cohesion or
    social support may be more important mediators in this cultural context
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This null finding is important for structural understanding - it suggests that
    in Puerto Rican cultural contexts, neighborhood-level collective efficacy may not be the primary pathway
    through which structural disadvantage affects alcohol outcomes. The authors suggest family-level factors
    may be more salient, highlighting how structural pathways may operate differently across cultural
    contexts and that US-based theoretical frameworks may not universally apply.
