direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Validated retrospective measures of childhood violence (ACE, ACE-IQ) enable
  systematic identification of violence exposure patterns in adult populations'
- 'Step 2: These measures allow researchers to establish prevalence rates and identify
  demographic, social, and structural risk factors associated with higher rates of
  childhood violence'
- 'Step 3: Risk factor identification reveals structural determinants such as poverty,
  neighborhood disadvantage, and policy gaps that increase vulnerability to violence'
- 'Step 4: This knowledge base informs targeted prevention strategies and policy interventions
  to reduce violence exposure among high-risk populations'
