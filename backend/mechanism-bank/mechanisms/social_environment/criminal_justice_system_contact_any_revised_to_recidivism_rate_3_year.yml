mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional court processing exposes youth to formal criminal justice system involvement'
- 'Step 2: System involvement creates official records and formal labeling of youth as delinquent'
- 'Step 3: Labeling effects may alter youth self-perception and social treatment by others'
- 'Step 4: Exposure to other justice-involved youth may introduce negative peer influences'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effects of labeling, stigma, and peer exposure increase likelihood of future delinquent
  behavior'

description: Traditional criminal justice processing increases future delinquent behavior in low-risk
  youth compared to diversion. The systematic review found that youth processed through traditional channels
  had approximately 50% reoffending rates compared to 44% for diverted youth, demonstrating the iatrogenic
  effect of formal system involvement.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that the criminal justice system itself can be a structural
    determinant of poor outcomes - a critical insight for health equity. Rather than being neutral or
    rehabilitative, formal processing appears to have net negative effects for low-risk youth. This shifts
    focus from individual youth pathology to system-level harm, supporting policies that minimize formal
    system contact. The finding has profound implications for racial equity given disparities in formal
    processing rates.
