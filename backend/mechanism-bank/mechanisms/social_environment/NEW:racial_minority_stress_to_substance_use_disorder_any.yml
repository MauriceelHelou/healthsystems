  to White transgender adults, reflecting the intersectional burden of racial and gender identity minority
  stress. This disparity demonstrates how compounded structural discrimination produces health inequities.

  description: Black participants were 1.59 times more likely to be diagnosed with drug use-related disorders
    compared to White participants
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights intersectionality - how overlapping systems of oppression
    (racism and transphobia) compound to create greater health burden for Black transgender individuals.
    The finding that both transfeminine status and Black race independently increase drug use disorder
    risk points to structural determinants rather than individual factors.
