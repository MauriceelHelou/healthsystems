description: BCT produces relatively large effects on relationship satisfaction (g=0.45 post-treatment,
  g=0.31 at 12-month follow-up). This was the largest effect size among the three outcome measures, suggesting
  relationship improvement is a primary mechanism through which BCT operates.

  equity_implications: Relationship quality functions as a social determinant of health. By improving
    relationship satisfaction, BCT strengthens the immediate social environment, which serves as a protective
    factor against substance use relapse. This highlights how treatment structure can modify social determinants.
