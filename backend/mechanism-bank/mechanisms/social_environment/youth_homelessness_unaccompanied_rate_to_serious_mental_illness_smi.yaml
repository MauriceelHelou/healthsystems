mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth experiencing homelessness face extreme environmental stressors including
  lack of stable shelter, food insecurity, and exposure to violence and exploitation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress activates prolonged hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
  axis responses, leading to dysregulation of stress hormones and neurobiological
  changes'
- 'Step 3: Traumatic experiences common during homelessness (physical assault, sexual
  violence, witnessing violence) directly contribute to PTSD symptomatology'
- 'Step 4: Social isolation, stigma, and loss of supportive relationships compound
  psychological distress and contribute to mood disorders and anxiety'
- 'Step 5: Limited access to mental health services and continuity of care prevents
  early intervention, allowing symptoms to progress to diagnosable disorders'

description: Transitional age youth experiencing homelessness (TAY-EH) demonstrate
  elevated rates of mood disorders, PTSD, and anxiety disorders compared to housed
  peers. This systematic review of 32 studies with 13,516 participants found consistent
  evidence of disproportionate psychopathology burden among homeless youth, driven
  by exposure to chronic stress, trauma, and barriers to mental health care.
