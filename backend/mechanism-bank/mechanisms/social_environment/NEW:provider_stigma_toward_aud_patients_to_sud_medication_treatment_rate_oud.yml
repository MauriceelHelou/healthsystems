mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medical education and professional culture perpetuate negative attitudes toward patients with
  substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Providers develop negative beliefs about the efficacy and appropriateness of AUD pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 3: Provider attitudes manifest as reluctance to diagnose, discuss, or treat AUD'
- 'Step 4: Stigmatizing attitudes reduce quality of care and patient engagement'
- 'Step 5: Patients with AUD experience barriers to accessing pharmacotherapy even when clinically indicated'

description: Provider stigma toward patients with alcohol use disorders, manifesting as negative attitudes
  and beliefs, creates a structural barrier to treatment access. This stigma is embedded in medical culture
  and education, not simply individual provider bias, and represents a systemic failure to treat addiction
  as a medical condition deserving evidence-based care.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Provider stigma toward AUD patients reflects broader societal stigma embedded in
    medical institutions. This is a structural competency issue because it traces to how medical education
    frames addiction, how healthcare systems incentivize or discourage addiction treatment, and how professional
    cultures perpetuate moralized views of substance use. Addressing this requires changing medical curricula,
    institutional policies, and professional norms—not just individual attitude adjustment.
