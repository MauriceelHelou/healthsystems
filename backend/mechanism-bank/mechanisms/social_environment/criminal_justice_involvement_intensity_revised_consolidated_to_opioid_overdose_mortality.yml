mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice involvement creates disruptions in treatment continuity and social stability'
- 'Step 2: Incarceration periods reduce opioid tolerance while maintaining addiction pathways'
- 'Step 3: Post-release individuals return to prior use patterns with reduced tolerance'
- 'Step 4: High propensity to experience overdose events (68% experienced overdose in this population)'
- 'Step 5: Low naloxone knowledge (only 56% correctly identified naloxone) limits overdose reversal capacity'

description: People who use opioids (PWUO) in criminal justice diversion addiction treatment have high
  rates of overdose experience (68% personal, 79% witnessed) but low naloxone knowledge (56%), regardless
  of justice involvement pattern intensity, creating structural vulnerability to fatal overdose.

  description: Men showed higher rates of high justice involvement (79.7%) compared to women (53.5%),
    and only men who personally overdosed showed significant association with naloxone knowledge
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the criminal justice system's approach to addiction
    creates structural barriers to overdose prevention. The finding that justice involvement patterns
    (high vs low) were NOT associated with naloxone knowledge suggests systemic failure in both criminal
    justice and healthcare systems to provide life-saving education. The diversion pathway represents
    a structural intervention opportunity but is currently underutilized for OEND.
