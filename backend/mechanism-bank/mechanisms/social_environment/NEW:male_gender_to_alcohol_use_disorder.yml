direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gender-specific cultural norms in East Asian societies encourage male drinking in social and
  business contexts'
- 'Step 2: Workplace expectations and networking practices often involve alcohol consumption for men'
- 'Step 3: Marketing of alcohol products disproportionately targets male consumers'
- 'Step 4: Social acceptance of heavy drinking among men reduces help-seeking and early intervention'
- 'Step 5: Biological differences in alcohol metabolism and genetic polymorphisms (e.g., ALDH2) interact
  with social exposure patterns'

description: Male gender is strongly associated with alcohol use disorder in East Asian populations, with
  men having nearly 6 times higher odds of AUD compared to women. This reflects deeply embedded structural
  and cultural factors including gendered social norms, workplace drinking expectations, and differential
  marketing exposure.

    among men
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism is fundamentally structural rather than individual. The nearly
    6-fold gender disparity reflects: (1) workplace policies and cultures that normalize business drinking
    for men, (2) alcohol industry marketing targeting male consumers, (3) gender role expectations that
    stigmatize female but not male drinking, and (4) differential access to treatment due to gendered
    stigma. Interventions should target workplace policies, marketing regulations, and cultural norm change
    rather than individual behavior modification. The high prevalence in Korea (16.73% lifetime) particularly
    reflects structural factors like ''hoesik'' (company dinner) culture.'
