mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates chronic stress and trauma exposure that increases substance use vulnerability'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing eliminates private space for managing substance use safely'
- 'Step 3: Street-based living exposes individuals to drug markets and substance-using networks'
- 'Step 4: Absence of housing stability undermines access to treatment and recovery support'

description: The study examines people who are unhoused and use drugs as the target population, recognizing
  the bidirectional relationship between housing instability and substance use driven by structural factors.

  sample_size: 106
spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: Study focused on Boston's Mass and Cass neighborhood, known for concentration of unhoused
    individuals who use drugs

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Study addresses impacts of mass relocation, suggesting forced displacement policies exacerbate
    drug use among unhoused populations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes homelessness as a structural condition that creates and
    perpetuates substance use rather than viewing drug use as an individual moral failing. The housing-first
    approach embedded in harm reduction housing addresses this structural root cause.
