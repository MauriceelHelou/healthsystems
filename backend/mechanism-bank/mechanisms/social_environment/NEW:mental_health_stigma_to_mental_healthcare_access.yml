direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pervasive stigma around mental illness creates negative social attitudes toward help-seeking'
- 'Step 2: Emerging adults internalize stigma and fear social judgment from peers, family, and romantic
  partners'
- 'Step 3: Concerns about peer rejection and negative perceptions deter individuals from initiating treatment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced help-seeking behavior leads to delayed or foregone mental healthcare access'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to societal-level stigmatization of mental illness rather
    than individual choice. Structural interventions targeting mental health education and public awareness
    campaigns could reduce this barrier. The mechanism disproportionately affects young adults during
    a vulnerable developmental period.
