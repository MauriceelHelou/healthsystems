direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pandemic lockdowns and social distancing measures physically isolate women
  from family, friends, and community support'
- 'Step 2: Isolation reduces women''s ability to seek help, access resources, or find
  temporary refuge from abusive situations'
- 'Step 3: Abusive partners gain increased control due to reduced social oversight
  and victim''s limited access to external support'
- 'Step 4: Weakened support networks reduce protection factors, allowing violence
  to precipitate or intensify'
