category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homeless youth face chronic stress, trauma, and lack of stable housing,
  leading to psychological distress and unmet mental health needs'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to mental health services and social support systems reduces
  healthy coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol becomes a readily available means of self-medication for trauma
  symptoms, anxiety, and mood disorders common in this population'
- 'Step 4: Street culture and peer influences in homeless environments normalize and
  reinforce alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: Continued exposure to homelessness-related adversity and lack of treatment
  resources leads to progression from alcohol misuse to alcohol use disorder'

description: This systematic review of 32 studies with 13,516 participants found elevated
  rates of alcohol misuse among transitional age youth experiencing homelessness.
  The pathway operates through multiple mechanisms including trauma exposure, co-occurring
  psychopathology (particularly PTSD, mood disorders, and anxiety), limited access
  to mental health services, and environmental factors inherent to homelessness that
  promote alcohol use as a coping strategy.
