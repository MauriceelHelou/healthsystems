mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High prevalence of student vaping creates frequent behavioral incidents requiring administrative
  response'
- 'Step 2: School administrators must address vaping incidents on school property, consuming significant
  time (>5 hours weekly at secondary level)'
- 'Step 3: Increased workload diverts administrative resources from other health promotion and educational
  activities'
- 'Step 4: Administrators report feeling underprepared and insufficiently supported to address substance
  use effectively'

  description: Secondary school administrators reported significantly more challenges and greater time
    burden compared to elementary/middle school administrators
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural gaps in school-based health promotion systems
    rather than individual student behavior. The lack of evidence-aligned strategies and resources reflects
    systemic under-investment in school health infrastructure. Administrators' willingness to change practices
    (64.7%) indicates receptivity to structural interventions.
