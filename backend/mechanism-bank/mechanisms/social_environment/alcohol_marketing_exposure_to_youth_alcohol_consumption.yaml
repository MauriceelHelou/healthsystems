direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol marketing (advertisements, sponsorships, social media) creates
  widespread exposure to pro-drinking messages targeting or accessible to youth populations'
- 'Step 2: Marketing exposure shapes social norms around alcohol use, making drinking
  appear normative, desirable, and socially acceptable among young people'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure increases positive alcohol expectancies, brand recognition,
  and favorable attitudes toward alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: These cognitive and attitudinal changes translate into initiation of drinking
  behavior and increased alcohol consumption among underage individuals'
