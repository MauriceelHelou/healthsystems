mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State-level incarceration disparities reflect structural racism embedded in criminal justice
  systems that disproportionately target Black communities'
- 'Step 2: High incarceration rates disrupt community social networks, family structures, and economic
  stability in Black neighborhoods'
- 'Step 3: Community-level trauma, chronic stress, and reduced social cohesion from mass incarceration
  create conditions that promote maladaptive coping'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to mental health resources and elevated psychosocial stress increase vulnerability
  to substance use as a coping mechanism'
- 'Step 5: Increased frequency of binge drinking emerges as a response to structural stressors associated
  with incarceration disparities'

description: State-level structural racism expressed through incarceration disparities is positively associated
  with binge drinking frequency among Black Americans. This reflects how racist criminal justice policies
  create community-level trauma and chronic stress that increase vulnerability to harmful alcohol use
  patterns.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 1946
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: State-level variation is central to this study; associations between structural racism
    and health behaviors vary by state-level policy and structural racism indices

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately traces alcohol use to structural root causes (racist
    incarceration policies) rather than blaming individuals. It recognizes that substance use behaviors
    emerge from structural conditions including community disruption, chronic stress, and limited resources
    caused by mass incarceration targeting Black communities.
