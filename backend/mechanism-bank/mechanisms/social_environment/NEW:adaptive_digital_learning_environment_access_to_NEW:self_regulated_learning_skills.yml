mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adaptive learning technologies provide personalized feedback and scaffolding tailored to individual
  learner needs'
- 'Step 2: Personalized support enables learners to develop metacognitive awareness of their learning
  processes'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced metacognition facilitates development of self-regulatory skills including planning,
  monitoring, and reflection'
- 'Step 4: Improved self-regulation transfers to other learning contexts and health-related decision-making'

description: Adaptive digital learning environments (ADLEs) support development of self-regulated learning
  (SRL) skills through personalized feedback, scaffolding, and learner-centric approaches. This systematic
  review of 38 empirical studies identified seven main research objectives including feedback/scaffolding,
  self-regulatory skills/strategies, learning trajectories, collaborative learning processes, adaptation/regulation,
  self-assessment, and help-seeking behavior.

  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural inequities in educational access by examining
    how technology-based interventions can provide personalized learning support that may otherwise be
    unavailable to students lacking access to individual tutoring or high-quality educational resources.
    The focus on adaptive environments rather than individual learner deficits represents a structurally
    competent approach. However, digital divide considerations mean these benefits may not reach all populations
    equally.
