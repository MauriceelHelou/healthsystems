- 'Step 3: These structural disadvantages create complex, intersecting service needs'
- 'Step 4: Multiple disadvantages compound to produce poor health outcomes'

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how criminal justice involvement serves as a structural
    sorting mechanism that concentrates social disadvantage. Rather than viewing these characteristics
    as individual risk factors, this framing recognizes them as products of structural inequities (racism,
    poverty, gender-based policing) that funnel certain populations into criminal justice supervision.
