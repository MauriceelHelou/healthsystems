category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Justice-involved young adults experience high rates of substance use disorders due to intersecting
  risk factors including trauma, socioeconomic disadvantage, and limited access to resources'
- 'Step 2: Community supervision (probation/parole) maintains ongoing access to substances while imposing
  structural barriers to treatment'
- 'Step 3: Justice system involvement creates stigma, documentation requirements, and scheduling conflicts
  that reduce treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Low treatment engagement perpetuates substance use disorders and associated health consequences'

description: Justice system involvement among young adults is associated with high rates of hazardous
  drug use (57.4%) while simultaneously creating barriers to treatment engagement. The study found 78.6%
  of justice-involved young adults with substance use issues were not currently participating in treatment.

    while creating treatment barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how criminal justice system contact creates structural
    barriers to healthcare access rather than individual deficits. The focus on community supervision
    (not incarceration) reveals how punitive approaches maintain substance access while restricting treatment
    access. The racial diversity of participants (including 20.6% Asian, 17.6% Black, 19.8% Latinx individuals)
    suggests differential exposure to justice involvement across racial groups.
