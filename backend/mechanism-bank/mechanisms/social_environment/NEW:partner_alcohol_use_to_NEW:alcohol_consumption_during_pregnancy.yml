  description: Patriarchal household structures may increase partner influence on pregnant women's behaviors

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how household-level social environments shaped by gender
    dynamics, cultural norms around alcohol, and partner behaviors create structural contexts that influence
    pregnant women's alcohol use. Interventions must address household and community-level factors rather
    than focusing solely on individual pregnant women.
