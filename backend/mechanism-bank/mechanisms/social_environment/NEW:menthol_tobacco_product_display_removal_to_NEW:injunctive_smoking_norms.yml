- 'Step 2: Adolescents shopping in retail environments observe absence of menthol tobacco products'

- 'Step 4: Perceived injunctive norms (beliefs about what behaviors others approve of) shift toward perceiving
  less social acceptance of menthol smoking'

description: Removal of menthol tobacco products from point-of-sale displays affects adolescents' perceptions
  of social approval for smoking menthol cigarettes (injunctive norms), with the retail environment serving
  as a signal of social norms.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how retail environment design and tobacco product placement
    policies shape youth perceptions of smoking acceptability. The structural intervention targets the
    commercial environment rather than individual behavior, recognizing that retail displays normalize
    tobacco use. This has equity implications as menthol tobacco marketing has historically targeted Black
    and other minoritized communities.
