description: Education access and quality is identified as a social determinant that may impact clinical
  recovery from concussion. Educational attainment likely influences health literacy, access to school-based
  health resources, and ability to follow complex recovery protocols.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Educational access and quality are structurally determined by neighborhood segregation,
    school funding policies, and historical disinvestment in communities. This mechanism connects educational
    policy to health outcomes, demonstrating how upstream structural factors shape downstream recovery
    trajectories. Educational inequities are not individual failures but products of systemic resource
    allocation decisions.
