direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FASD causes deficits in memory, executive functioning, and language comprehension'
- 'Step 2: During criminal investigations and cross-examinations, individuals with FASD are more susceptible
  to leading questions'
- 'Step 3: Confabulation (memory distortion) leads to provision of inaccurate information that may be
  self-incriminating'
- 'Step 4: False confessions occur due to impulsive decision-making and desire to please authority figures'
- 'Step 5: Witness reliability issues and false accusations arise from memory deficits, contributing to
  wrongful convictions'

    convictions by ensuring appropriate accommodations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The criminal justice system's failure to screen for and accommodate FASD represents
    a structural barrier that disproportionately harms individuals with this disability. The burden falls
    on already marginalized populations who may have experienced prenatal alcohol exposure due to lack
    of maternal healthcare access and substance use treatment resources.
