- 'Step 1: Pre-existing mental health and substance use disorders increase risk of family conflict and
  housing instability'

  prospects'

- 'Step 4: Substance use disorders deplete financial resources and damage supportive relationships'
- 'Step 5: Limited mental health treatment access allows conditions to worsen, precipitating homelessness'

description: The paper explicitly notes that adolescents with existing mental health and substance use
  disorders are at higher risk for homelessness, indicating a bidirectional relationship where mental
  health conditions both precede and are exacerbated by housing instability.

  equity_implications: This bidirectional mechanism highlights how inadequate mental health infrastructure
    and youth services create pathways to homelessness. Rather than individual pathology, this reflects
    systemic failures to provide accessible mental health treatment, family support services, and housing
    stability programs for vulnerable youth. Prevention requires upstream investment in youth mental health
    services and family stabilization programs.
