mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal stigma around eating disorders creates internalized shame and guilt in affected individuals'
- 'Step 2: Patients fear judgment from healthcare providers, family, and community members'
- 'Step 3: Shame leads to concealment of symptoms and avoidance of disclosure'
- 'Step 4: Reduced help-seeking behavior results in delayed or foregone treatment engagement'

  description: Stigma, shame and guilt identified as most prominent barrier specifically from patient
    perspective, may be less recognized by caregivers and clinicians
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how societal-level stigmatization of eating disorders
    creates structural barriers to care. Rather than blaming individuals for not seeking treatment, it
    identifies how cultural attitudes and social environments discourage help-seeking. Anti-stigma campaigns
    are recommended as structural interventions to address this barrier.
