mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prison populations contain 59-83% individuals with alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Prison environment creates stress, trauma, and limited coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate evidence-based alcohol treatment programs within prison systems'
- 'Step 4: Release without addressing AUD leads to recidivism and continued disorder'

description: Prison populations show 59-83% prevalence of alcohol use disorders, indicating the prison
  system concentrates individuals with AUD without providing adequate evidence-based treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The high AUD prevalence in prisons reflects structural failures in both pre-incarceration
    alcohol treatment access and in-prison intervention capacity. The criminal justice system functions
    to warehouse individuals with alcohol problems rather than treat them, perpetuating health inequities.
