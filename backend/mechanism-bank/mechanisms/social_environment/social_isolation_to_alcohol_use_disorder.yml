direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social isolation reduces opportunities for positive social interactions and emotional support'
- 'Step 2: Isolated individuals experience lower subjective well-being and increased negative affect (sad,
  stressed, anxious language)'
- 'Step 3: Solitary drinking emerges as a coping mechanism in the absence of social buffering'
- 'Step 4: Drinking alone is strongly associated with problematic alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 5: Repeated solitary drinking reinforces negative affect cycles and increases AUD risk'

description: Drinking alone is strongly negatively correlated with subjective well-being (r = -0.29 between-person),
  whereas total drinking shows a much weaker relationship (r = -0.10). Individuals who drink alone describe
  their feelings using sad, stressed, and anxious language, indicating that solitary drinking contexts
  are markers of problematic consumption patterns linked to lower psychological well-being.

  description: Drinking with friends/others substantially weakens the negative relationship between alcohol
    consumption and well-being compared to drinking alone
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies social context as a structural determinant of problematic
    alcohol use. The finding shifts focus from individual drinking behavior to the social environment
    in which drinking occurs. Occupational factors (restaurant work) may create structural conditions
    promoting solitary drinking. Interventions should address social isolation rather than blaming individual
    drinking choices.
