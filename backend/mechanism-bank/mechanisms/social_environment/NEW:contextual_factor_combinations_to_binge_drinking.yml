- 'Step 1: Multiple contextual factors (location, companions, mood, timing) combine in specific configurations'
- 'Step 2: Certain combinations create ''risky contexts'' that synergistically promote heavy drinking'
- 'Step 3: Other combinations create ''protective contexts'' that constrain consumption'
- 'Step 4: Sequences of contextual factors shape the broader drinking occasion and influence outcomes'

description: Specific combinations and sequences of context-related factors (physical setting, social
  attributes, individual state) are associated with heavy drinking occasions. The interaction of these
  components determines drinking behavior and consequences.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes how multiple structural and environmental factors interact
    to shape drinking behavior. Public health interventions and policies should target modifiable contextual
    combinations rather than individual behavior change. Understanding risky vs. protective context combinations
    enables structural interventions.
