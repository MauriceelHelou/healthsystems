description: Gender inequality structures differential vulnerability to financial harm from others' drinking.
  Women in nine of 15 countries studied experienced significantly higher rates of financial harm, reflecting
  gendered patterns of economic control and household resource allocation.

  sample_size: 38617
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Financial harm was significantly more common among women than men in nine of the 15
    countries studied, suggesting variation in gendered effects across different social contexts

  description: In countries with greater gender equality, the disparity in financial harm between men
    and women may be reduced
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly identifies gender inequality as a structural determinant
    that shapes who bears the burden of alcohol-related harms. Rather than attributing differences to
    individual circumstances, it traces the disparity to systemic gender-based economic inequalities.
    The variation across countries (significant in 9 of 15) suggests that structural gender equality policies
    could mitigate these harms. This represents an equity-focused analysis that identifies intervention
    points at the structural level.
