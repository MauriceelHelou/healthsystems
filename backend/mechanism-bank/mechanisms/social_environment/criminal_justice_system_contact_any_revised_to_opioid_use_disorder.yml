description: The abstract notes that criminal justice-involved populations with OUD have 'high rates of
  relapse' upon release, indicating a bidirectional relationship where CJS involvement exacerbates OUD
  through structural mechanisms including treatment barriers, stigma, and limited reentry support.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the cyclical relationship between incarceration and substance
    use disorder. Mass incarceration policies disproportionately affect communities of color and those
    in poverty, creating structural conditions that perpetuate both substance use and justice involvement.
    The study's acknowledgment of stigma limiting MOUD in CJS settings reflects policy-level barriers.
