structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Perceived organizational support reflects organizational policies and practices
    that are structurally determined rather than individual-level factors. Organizations operating under
    different regulatory environments, union presence, and corporate governance structures provide varying
    levels of support to workers. This structural variation in workplace conditions creates differential
    exposure to job insecurity.
