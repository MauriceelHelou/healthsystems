mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permissive parenting provides warmth but lacks consistent behavioral control and limit-setting'
- 'Step 2: Children receive fewer clear boundaries regarding acceptable behaviors including substance
  use'
- 'Step 3: Limited parental monitoring reduces oversight of peer activities and substance exposure'
- 'Step 4: Youth may interpret permissiveness as implicit approval of experimentation'
- 'Step 5: Modestly increased substance use in offspring'

description: Meta-analysis found a very small but statistically significant positive correlation between
  permissive parenting (high warmth, low control) and offspring substance use. The effect size of r=0.04
  indicates this association is quite weak.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Permissive parenting styles may be influenced by cultural norms, generational patterns,
    and lack of access to parenting resources and education. The very small effect size suggests this
    is a minor contributor compared to other structural and environmental factors.
