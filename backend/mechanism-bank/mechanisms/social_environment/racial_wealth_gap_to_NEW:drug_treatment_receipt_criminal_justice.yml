direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential treatment within criminal justice system'
- 'Step 2: African Americans on probation/parole face systemic barriers to drug treatment access'
- 'Step 3: These barriers result in 50% lower likelihood of receiving drug treatment compared to White
  individuals'
- 'Step 4: Racial disparity persists regardless of criminal justice involvement (also observed in non-supervised
  population)'

description: Being African American is associated with approximately half the likelihood (OR ~0.5) of
  receiving drug treatment compared to being White, both among those on probation/parole and those not
  under supervision. This represents a persistent structural inequity in treatment access.

  description: Racial disparity present both for those on probation/parole and those not, but criminal
    justice involvement compounds existing inequities
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding demonstrates how structural racism operates within both healthcare
    and criminal justice systems to produce treatment disparities. The disparity is not explained by criminal
    justice involvement alone, suggesting deeper systemic barriers. The mechanism avoids individual blame
    by identifying race as a structural category that shapes institutional treatment, not as an individual
    characteristic causing differential behavior.
