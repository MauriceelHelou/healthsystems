mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Older adults experience loss of meaningful social roles (work identity, parenting role)'
- 'Step 2: Role loss leads to decreased sense of purpose and social identity'
- 'Step 3: Loss of structured daily activities and social connections'
- 'Step 4: Psychological distress and increased unstructured time may increase alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: Development of late-onset alcohol use disorder or heavy drinking'

description: Role and identity loss is associated with increased risk for late-onset AUD or heavy drinking.
  Notably, the review distinguishes this from retirement per se - retirement itself was not found to increase
  risk, but the broader concept of role/identity loss was identified as a risk factor.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Role/identity loss is structurally determined by labor market structures that define
    worth through employment, lack of meaningful engagement opportunities for older adults, and inadequate
    social infrastructure for post-retirement life. This mechanism highlights how societal structures
    around aging and productivity create vulnerability. Equity implications include differential access
    to meaningful post-work roles based on socioeconomic status and social capital.
