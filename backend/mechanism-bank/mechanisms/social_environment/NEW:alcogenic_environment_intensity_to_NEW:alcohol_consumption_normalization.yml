mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased exposure to alcohol brand marketing in everyday environments'
- 'Step 2: Brand imagery becomes normalized part of visual landscape'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure creates familiarity and positive associations with alcohol brands'
- 'Step 4: Social norms shift toward viewing alcohol consumption as normal, expected behavior'
- 'Step 5: Lower perceived risk and higher social acceptability of alcohol use'

description: Alcogenic environments characterized by ubiquitous alcohol brand imagery contribute to the
  normalization of alcohol consumption by making alcohol brands a routine part of daily visual experience,
  shifting social norms toward greater acceptability of drinking.

  description: In societies with established drinking cultures, additional normalization may have stronger
    effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces how environmental exposures created by industry marketing
    shape population-level norms, not individual decisions. The inequity stems from differential exposure
    - children and those seeking recovery cannot avoid these exposures in public spaces.
