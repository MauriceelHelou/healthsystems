  description: Wealthier students had higher odds of attending open bar events, suggesting economic resources

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the failure of regulatory policy to restrict alcohol
    advertising to minors. The structural root cause is inadequate enforcement of advertising restrictions,
    not individual youth choices. Equity implications include differential vulnerability based on socioeconomic
    status.
