description: Despite high recall and some knowledge/attitude changes, there is little evidence that mass
  media campaigns reduce actual alcohol consumption. This finding held across 13 studies measuring consumption,
  though most campaigns did not explicitly aim to reduce consumption.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies primarily in developed countries; most campaigns did not explicitly aim to
    reduce consumption

  description: Most included studies were of weak quality, limiting confidence in findings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This null finding highlights a critical structural issue: information-based interventions
    that target individual decision-making fail to address the structural drivers of alcohol consumption
    including pricing policies, outlet density, marketing exposure, and social norms shaped by commercial
    interests. Effective alcohol harm reduction requires policy-level interventions (taxation, availability
    restrictions, marketing bans) rather than relying on individuals to change behavior despite unchanged
    environmental conditions.'
