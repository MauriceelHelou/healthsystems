direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adverse childhood experiences create neurobiological and psychological
  stress responses that persist into adulthood'
- 'Step 2: These stress responses and trauma-related emotional dysregulation lead
  individuals to seek maladaptive coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol becomes a preferred coping strategy, with binge drinking patterns
  emerging as a way to self-medicate and manage psychological distress'

description: Higher ACE scores are associated with increased prevalence of binge drinking
  through psychological and neurobiological stress pathways. The relationship shows
  a dose-response pattern, with odds ratios ranging from 1.09 to 3.32 depending on
  study population and ACE severity. Specific ACE domains like household substance
  use (OR=1.256) and emotional abuse show particularly strong associations with binge
  drinking behaviors.
structural_competency_notes: The ACE-binge drinking pathway is influenced by structural
  factors including healthcare access barriers, socioeconomic disparities, and inadequate
  mental health infrastructure. Individuals with higher ACE scores face compounded
  disadvantages including reduced insurance coverage and limited access to trauma-informed
  care, perpetuating cycles of substance use as maladaptive coping mechanisms.
