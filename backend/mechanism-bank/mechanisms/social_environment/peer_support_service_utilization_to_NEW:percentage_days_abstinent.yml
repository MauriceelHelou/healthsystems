description: AA/TSF interventions demonstrate superior performance for percentage days abstinent at 24-month
  follow-up compared to other clinical interventions, with a mean difference of 12.91 percentage points
  (95% CI 7.55-18.29). Effects were comparable at 12 months but diverged favorably at longer follow-up.

  equity_implications: The sustained and improving effectiveness over time highlights the importance of
    ongoing community-based social infrastructure for recovery. Unlike time-limited clinical interventions,
    AA provides perpetual access to peer support, addressing the chronic nature of AUD through structural
    rather than episodic care.
