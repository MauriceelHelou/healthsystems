description: The paper explicitly identifies the need to 'de-stigmatize and increase treatment-seeking
  for AUD' as a critical unmet need alongside expanding pharmacotherapy options. This highlights stigma
  as a structural barrier to AUD treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Stigma is a social-structural phenomenon, not an individual failing. Addressing
    stigma requires policy, education, and healthcare system changes rather than blaming individuals for
    not seeking treatment. This mechanism recognizes that severe under-treatment of AUD is driven by systemic
    barriers.
