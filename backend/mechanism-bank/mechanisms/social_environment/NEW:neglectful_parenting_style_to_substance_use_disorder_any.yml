mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neglectful parenting involves low warmth and low control/monitoring in the family environment'
- 'Step 2: Children experience reduced supervision and fewer limits on behavior'
- 'Step 3: Lack of emotional support increases vulnerability to peer influence and negative coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Reduced parental monitoring allows greater opportunity for substance experimentation'
- 'Step 5: Increased initiation and escalation of psychoactive substance use in offspring'

description: Meta-analysis found that neglectful parenting (low warmth, low control) showed the strongest
  positive association with offspring substance use among the non-authoritative parenting styles. The
  correlation of 0.10 indicates a small but consistent risk-increasing effect.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Neglectful parenting often results from structural conditions including poverty,
    parental mental health challenges, work demands requiring multiple jobs, lack of childcare support,
    and community-level adversity. Rather than blaming parents, interventions should address economic
    security, workplace policies, and social services that enable engaged parenting.
