description: Narrative synthesis from the systematic review indicated some reductions in AOD-related assault
  rates and arrests following whole-of-community interventions. However, results were equivocal, suggesting
  inconsistent effects across studies and settings.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The pathway from community intervention to reduced crime operates through structural
    changes in the alcohol environment rather than individual deterrence. By coordinating law enforcement
    with prevention efforts, these interventions aim to modify the conditions that produce AOD-related
    crime. However, the inclusion of enforcement-heavy approaches requires attention to potential equity
    implications regarding over-policing in marginalized communities.
