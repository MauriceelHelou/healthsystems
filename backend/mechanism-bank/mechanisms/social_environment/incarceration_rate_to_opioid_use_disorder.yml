description: The paper establishes that over half of the estimated 2.5 million Americans with opioid use
  disorder have had prior contact with the criminal justice system. This reflects the bidirectional relationship
  between criminal justice involvement and substance use disorder, where structural factors associated
  with incarceration increase vulnerability to continued OUD while limiting access to effective treatment.

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates the structural co-occurrence of criminal justice involvement
    and opioid use disorder. Rather than framing this as individual pathology, the structural competency
    lens recognizes that criminalization of substance use, combined with inadequate treatment access,
    creates a feedback loop that perpetuates both incarceration and addiction. Addressing this requires
    decriminalization and integration of public health approaches rather than continued reliance on punitive
    interventions.
