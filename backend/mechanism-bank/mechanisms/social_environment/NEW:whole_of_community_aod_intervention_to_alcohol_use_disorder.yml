mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Whole-of-community interventions mobilize community leaders, organizations, and policy-makers
  across multiple settings (schools, sporting clubs, police, retail premises)'
- 'Step 2: Coordinated interventions create environmental changes that reduce alcohol availability, marketing
  exposure, and social acceptability of risky drinking'
- 'Step 3: Changes in community norms and enforcement reduce opportunities for problematic drinking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Population-level reduction in risky drinking (AUDIT >8) as measured by validated screening
  tools'

description: Whole-of-community interventions that coordinate efforts across multiple settings (schools,
  sporting clubs, law enforcement, retail) to address alcohol and other drug use produce significant reductions
  in risky drinking (AUDIT >8) with a 22% relative risk reduction. This represents a structural approach
  that modifies environmental and policy factors rather than targeting individual behavior alone.

  description: High risk of bias due to lack of random allocation, selective reporting, and significant
    attrition may moderate effect estimates

  strength: moderate
  description: Interventions implemented in two or more community settings were required for inclusion,
    suggesting multi-setting approaches may enhance effectiveness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention by targeting community-level
    systems rather than individual behavior change. The approach recognizes that alcohol-related harms
    arise from complex interactions between availability, social norms, enforcement, and environmental
    factors. By mobilizing multiple stakeholders and modifying the built and social environment simultaneously,
    these interventions address root causes. However, high risk of bias limits confidence in effect estimates.
