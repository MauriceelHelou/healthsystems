mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young people from ethnic minority backgrounds experience structural barriers to mental healthcare
  including cultural incongruence of treatment approaches'
- 'Step 2: Historical and ongoing discrimination creates medical mistrust and reduces treatment engagement'
- 'Step 3: Treatment protocols developed primarily for majority populations may not address culturally-specific
  presentations or needs'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment engagement and cultural mismatch lead to poorer psychotherapy outcomes for
  mental disorders'

description: Ethnic minority status predicts poorer psychotherapy treatment outcomes for young people
  (ages 12-30) with mental disorders. This systematic review of 114 studies found that ethnic minority
  status may predict poorer outcomes, reflecting structural inequities in mental healthcare delivery and
  cultural competence of treatment approaches.

  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural racism in mental healthcare systems. The finding
    that ethnic minority youth have poorer treatment outcomes is not due to individual factors but rather
    to healthcare systems designed primarily for majority populations. Equity implications include the
    need for culturally-adapted interventions, increased diversity in mental health workforce, and addressing
    structural barriers to care engagement for minority youth.
