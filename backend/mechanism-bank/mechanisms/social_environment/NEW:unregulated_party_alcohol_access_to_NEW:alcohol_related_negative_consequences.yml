direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-campus parties operate outside institutional alcohol regulations and monitoring'
- 'Step 2: Unregulated environments lack drink-counting mechanisms and responsible service practices'
- 'Step 3: The bottomless cup model promotes higher blood alcohol concentrations through unlimited access'
- 'Step 4: Greater consumption leads to increased negative consequences including acute intoxication effects'
- 'Step 5: Maximum expenditure on cup purchase predicts alcohol-related consequences even after controlling
  for other metrics'

description: The study identifies unregulated off-campus party environments as structural contexts that
  facilitate harmful drinking patterns. Unlike regulated venues with responsible beverage service, these
  settings lack mechanisms to limit consumption. The hierarchical regression finding that maximum expenditure
  uniquely predicts alcohol-related consequences beyond standard purchase task metrics suggests the bottomless
  cup model creates distinct risk beyond general alcohol demand.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism correctly identifies the regulatory environment as the structural
    driver rather than individual decision-making. The absence of regulation at off-campus parties represents
    a policy gap that creates differential exposure to alcohol-related harms. College students in communities
    with more off-campus party cultures may face greater structural risk. Solutions should focus on environmental
    management strategies and extending harm reduction to unregulated settings.
