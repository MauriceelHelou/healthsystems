mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incarceration disparities represent structural racism that concentrates criminal justice involvement
  in Black communities'
- 'Step 2: Mass incarceration destabilizes families, reduces household income, and limits employment opportunities
  in affected communities'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to community-level trauma and economic instability elevates psychosocial stress
  and allostatic load'
- 'Step 4: Tobacco industry has historically targeted stressed communities with aggressive marketing and
  increased outlet density'
- 'Step 5: Smoking becomes more prevalent as both a stress-coping mechanism and due to increased environmental
  availability'

description: State-level incarceration disparities (a dimension of structural racism) are positively associated
  with smoking status among Black Americans. The incarceration dimension showed consistent positive associations
  with both smoking status and smoking frequency.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: State-level variation in structural racism indices drives geographic variation in smoking
    prevalence among Black Americans
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers structural racism in criminal justice as a driver of tobacco
    use, avoiding individual blame. It recognizes that smoking disparities emerge from racist policies
    that create community conditions conducive to tobacco use, not from individual choices made in a vacuum.
