mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children exposed to adverse childhood experiences (witnessing parental
  IPV, being abused as a child) develop normalized perceptions of violence in intimate
  relationships'
- 'Step 2: Early exposure to violence disrupts healthy attachment formation and emotional
  regulation development, leading to maladaptive relationship patterns'
- 'Step 3: Learned behavioral patterns and cognitive schemas about relationships increase
  likelihood of both perpetrating violence (for males) and experiencing victimization
  (for females) in adult intimate partnerships'
- 'Step 4: Intergenerational transmission of violence perpetuates cycle, with childhood
  violence exposure being a consistent risk marker across diverse populations'

description: Adverse childhood experiences, particularly witnessing parental intimate
  partner violence and experiencing child abuse, are consistent risk markers for both
  IPV perpetration (in males) and IPV victimization (in females) in adulthood. Meta-analytic
  evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates medium-to-large effect sizes for male
  perpetration and small but significant effects for female victimization. The intergenerational
  transmission of violence operates through normalized perceptions of violence in
  relationships, disrupted attachment patterns, and learned behavioral responses that
  increase vulnerability to both perpetrating and experiencing violence in intimate
  partnerships.
