to_node:
  node_id: dental_care_access
  node_name: Dental Care Access
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of awareness among caregivers, families, and the public about oral health needs of people
  with disabilities'
- 'Step 2: Dental care may be deprioritized relative to other medical needs or perceived as less urgent'
- 'Step 3: Preventive dental visits are delayed or not scheduled, leading to presentation only for emergencies'
- 'Step 4: Oral health problems advance to more severe stages requiring complex interventions'
- 'Step 5: Cycle of poor oral health perpetuates due to reactive rather than preventive care patterns'

description: The review identified lack of awareness regarding the need for dental treatment as a barrier
  for people with disabilities. This affects both self-advocacy and caregiver decision-making about prioritizing
  dental care.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this appears behavioral, the underlying cause is structural - lack of public
    health messaging targeting disability communities, insufficient integration of dental screening into
    disability services, and healthcare systems that silo oral health from overall care. Interventions
    should focus on system-level integration rather than blaming individuals for lack of awareness.
