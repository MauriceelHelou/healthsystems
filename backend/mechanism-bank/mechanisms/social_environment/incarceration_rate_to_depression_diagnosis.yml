- 'Step 1: Poverty and social marginalization in LMICs create conditions that both increase depression
  risk and criminal justice contact'
- 'Step 2: Incarceration disrupts social support networks, employment, and family connections'
- 'Step 3: Prison conditions including overcrowding, violence, and isolation exacerbate depressive symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to mental health treatment within LMIC prison systems prevents adequate care'

description: Major depression prevalence among prisoners in LMICs is 16.0% (95% CI 11.7-20.8), approximately
  6 times higher than general populations, reflecting both selection effects and the depressogenic nature
  of incarceration environments.

  description: Higher prevalence observed at prison intake suggests pre-existing conditions are concentrated
    among those entering the justice system
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The elevated depression prevalence reflects structural violence - the concentration
    of socially marginalized populations within carceral systems. Poverty, lack of mental health services,
    and criminalization of survival behaviors funnel vulnerable individuals into prisons where conditions
    worsen mental health. This is a policy failure, not individual pathology.
