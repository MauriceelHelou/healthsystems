mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness leads to inadequate access to hygiene facilities and sanitation'
- 'Step 2: Poor hygiene conditions increase exposure to body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis), the primary
  vector for Bartonella quintana'
- 'Step 3: Body lice infestation facilitates transmission of B. quintana bacteria through louse feces
  contaminating skin abrasions'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged homelessness duration increases cumulative exposure risk to infected vectors'
- 'Step 5: Resulting in higher seroprevalence rates among homeless populations compared to housed populations'

description: This systematic review of 45 articles identified homeless people as the main target population
  for Bartonella quintana infection, with seroprevalence rates varying widely (0.2%-65%) across 84 subpopulations
  globally. The structural conditions of homelessness - lack of access to hygiene, crowded shelters, and
  inability to maintain personal cleanliness - create ideal conditions for body lice transmission of this
  bacterium.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism clearly traces to structural root causes: housing policy failures,
    inadequate social safety nets, and lack of accessible hygiene infrastructure for unhoused populations.
    The infection burden reflects systemic inequities rather than individual choices. Homeless period
    duration as a risk factor emphasizes how prolonged exposure to inadequate housing conditions compounds
    health risks. Policy interventions should focus on housing-first approaches, accessible hygiene facilities,
    and healthcare outreach rather than individual behavioral change.'
