mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited substance use treatment infrastructure in LMICs results in criminalization rather than
  treatment of alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-related offenses and behaviors increase likelihood of incarceration'
- 'Step 3: Prison systems lack adequate detoxification and treatment services'
- 'Step 4: Incarceration disrupts any existing treatment relationships and support systems'

description: Alcohol use disorder prevalence among prisoners in LMICs is 3.8% (95% CI 1.2-7.6), approximately
  double that of general populations. Geographic variation shows higher rates in Southeast Asia versus
  Eastern Mediterranean regions.

  variation_notes: Prevalence of alcohol use disorders was higher in the Southeast Asian region than in
    the Eastern Mediterranean region, reflecting cultural and policy differences in alcohol availability
    and criminalization

  description: Southeast Asian region showed higher prevalence than Eastern Mediterranean region, likely
    reflecting differential alcohol policies and cultural factors

  strength: moderate
  description: Increased prevalence at prison intake suggests active alcohol use disorders are common
    among those entering the justice system
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The geographic variation in alcohol use disorder prevalence reflects differential
    alcohol policies - countries with stricter alcohol prohibition (Eastern Mediterranean) show lower
    prisoner prevalence. This demonstrates how policy environments shape both substance use patterns and
    criminalization. The treatment gap in LMICs means alcohol problems are addressed through incarceration
    rather than healthcare.
