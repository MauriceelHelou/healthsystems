mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with serious mental illness are overrepresented in criminal-legal system settings'
- 'Step 2: Jails, probation, and parole agencies have rudimentary data use capacity for mental health
  service coordination'
- 'Step 3: Limited data sharing between criminal justice and community mental health agencies disrupts
  care continuity'
- 'Step 4: Fragmented mental health care exacerbates symptoms and increases recidivism risk'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects the criminalization of mental illness as a structural phenomenon.
    The overrepresentation of individuals with SMI in jails results from inadequate community mental health
    infrastructure, not individual choices. The data infrastructure gaps identified represent actionable
    structural targets for intervention. Equity implications include disproportionate impact on communities
    of color and low-income populations.
