- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential access to healthcare resources and quality care'
- 'Step 2: Racial minorities may face implicit bias in clinical assessment and treatment recommendations'
- 'Step 3: Social and community context factors associated with race affect recovery environment and support
  systems'
- 'Step 4: Intersecting disadvantages in economic stability and education access compound healthcare barriers'
- 'Step 5: These cumulative structural factors extend the time needed for clinical recovery from concussion'

description: Race appears to have an association with the speed of concussion recovery, with racial minorities
  potentially experiencing longer recovery times. This relationship is likely mediated through structural
  factors including differential healthcare access, implicit bias in clinical care, and intersecting social
  determinants.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism fundamentally traces to structural racism rather than biological
    differences. The association between race and recovery reflects accumulated disadvantages in healthcare
    access, quality of care received, and social support systems. The review appropriately frames this
    as a social determinant rather than an individual characteristic, recognizing that race serves as
    a proxy for exposure to structural inequities.
