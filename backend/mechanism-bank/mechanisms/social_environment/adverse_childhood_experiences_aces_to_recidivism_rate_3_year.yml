mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative exposure to adverse childhood experiences (abuse, neglect, household dysfunction)
  creates toxic stress during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress dysregulates neurobiological systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  axis and prefrontal cortex development'
- 'Step 3: Impaired executive function, emotional regulation, and impulse control increase risk-taking
  and antisocial behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Structural disadvantages associated with ACE exposure (poverty, unstable housing, limited education)
  reduce access to prosocial opportunities'
- 'Step 5: These combined neurobiological and structural factors increase likelihood of reoffending among
  justice-involved individuals'

description: This meta-analysis of 16 studies (101,778 participants) found a small but significant overall
  effect where cumulative adverse childhood experiences increased the odds of reoffending among court-involved
  individuals. The effect was particularly pronounced in youth populations, with adult samples showing
  non-significant relationships. The findings support screening for ACEs in court settings, especially
  youth courts, to identify those at highest risk for recidivism and in need of trauma-informed intervention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism appropriately traces criminal justice outcomes to early life structural
    exposures rather than individual moral failings. ACEs themselves are structurally determined - children
    in poverty, unstable housing, and marginalized communities experience higher ACE exposure. The recommendation
    for court-based ACE screening represents a structural intervention that could redirect youth from
    punitive to therapeutic pathways. Equity implications are significant: communities of color and low-income
    communities experience both higher ACE prevalence and higher rates of justice involvement, creating
    compounding structural disadvantage. The finding that effects are stronger in youth suggests developmental
    windows where intervention could disrupt the ACE-to-incarceration pipeline.'
