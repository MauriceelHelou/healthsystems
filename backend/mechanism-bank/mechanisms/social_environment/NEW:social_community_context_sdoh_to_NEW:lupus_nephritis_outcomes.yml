description: Social and community context as an SDoH domain affects lupus nephritis through social support,
  stress pathways, and discrimination
moderators:
- name: Discrimination exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Experiences of discrimination amplify stress pathways and worsen outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Social context reflects structural conditions including racism, community disinvestment,
    and social exclusion. Lupus nephritis disproportionately affects Black women, and structural racism
    contributes to both disease incidence and outcomes through multiple pathways. Interventions must address
    discrimination and community-level supports.
