direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mass media campaigns (TV, radio, other channels) deliver health messages about alcohol to general
  population'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure to campaign messaging increases population-level awareness of alcohol-related
  harms'
- 'Step 3: Knowledge about alcohol consumption guidelines and health effects increases, especially where
  baseline knowledge was low'
- 'Step 4: High recall of campaigns indicates successful message penetration into public consciousness'

description: Mass media health campaigns about alcohol achieve high recall rates and successfully increase
  population knowledge about alcohol consumption, particularly in contexts where baseline knowledge was
  low. However, these knowledge gains do not necessarily translate to behavior change.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a public health information dissemination strategy. While
    it addresses population-level knowledge, it does not address structural determinants of alcohol availability,
    affordability, or marketing exposure that drive consumption patterns. The focus on individual knowledge
    change without addressing environmental factors limits structural impact.
