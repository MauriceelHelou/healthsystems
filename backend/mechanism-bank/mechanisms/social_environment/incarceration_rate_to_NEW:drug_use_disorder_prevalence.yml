- 'Step 1: Drug criminalization policies in LMICs prioritize incarceration over treatment'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with drug use disorders are disproportionately arrested and incarcerated'
- 'Step 3: Limited harm reduction and treatment services in LMIC prison systems fail to address addiction'
- 'Step 4: Prison environments may expose individuals to new substances and drug-using networks'

description: Drug use disorder prevalence among prisoners in LMICs is 5.1% (95% CI 2.9-7.8), approximately
  6 times higher than general populations. Regional variation shows higher rates in Eastern Mediterranean
  compared to European LMIC regions.

  description: Eastern Mediterranean region showed higher drug use disorder prevalence than Europe, possibly
    reflecting drug transit routes and enforcement intensity
- name: prison_intake_timing
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Increased prevalence at intake indicates drug use disorders are concentrated among those
    entering the criminal justice system
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The 6-fold prevalence ratio reflects the criminalization of drug use rather than
    its treatment as a health issue. Regional variation (Eastern Mediterranean > Europe) likely reflects
    proximity to drug production/trafficking routes and punitive drug policies. This mechanism demonstrates
    how the war on drugs concentrates vulnerable populations in prisons rather than treatment settings.
