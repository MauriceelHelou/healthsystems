description: PLWH who reported suicidal ideation were 1.83 times more likely to report HIV-related stigma.
  This reflects how structural stigma and discrimination create conditions of hopelessness and psychological
  distress that contribute to suicidal thoughts.

  description: Social support serves as protective factor against both stigma and suicidal ideation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Suicidal ideation is framed as a consequence of structural stigma and discrimination
    rather than individual mental health vulnerability. The paper emphasizes that addressing stigma at
    multiple levels - including healthcare provider discrimination and structural inequalities - is necessary
    to reduce suicide risk among PLWH.
