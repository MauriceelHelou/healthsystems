mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness exposes adolescents to chronic adversity, trauma, and unpredictable environments'
- 'Step 2: Survival in street environments may require aggressive or rule-breaking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Lack of stable adult relationships and prosocial role models disrupts behavioral development'
- 'Step 4: Untreated trauma and stress manifest as externalizing behavioral problems'
- 'Step 5: Without mental health intervention, disruptive behavior patterns become entrenched disorders'

  disorder identified. This reflects how structural housing instability creates conditions that promote
  behavioral disorders in developing youth.

  description: High prevalence of substance use disorders among this population likely exacerbates disruptive
    behavior disorder symptoms
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Disruptive behavior disorder prevalence reflects structural conditions of homelessness
    rather than individual character flaws. The chaotic, unsafe environments homeless youth navigate require
    adaptive behaviors that may be pathologized. Addressing this requires housing-first approaches and
    trauma-informed mental health services rather than punitive responses that further marginalize affected
    youth.
