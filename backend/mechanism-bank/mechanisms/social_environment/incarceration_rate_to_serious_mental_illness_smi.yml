mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate mental health infrastructure in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) leads
  to insufficient community-based treatment options'
- 'Step 2: Untreated mental illness increases vulnerability to behaviors that lead to criminal justice
  involvement'
- 'Step 3: Prison environments expose individuals to stress, trauma, and conditions that exacerbate or
  precipitate mental illness'
- 'Step 4: Lack of adequate psychiatric care within prison systems perpetuates high rates of psychosis
  and depression among incarcerated populations'

description: Non-affective psychosis prevalence among prisoners in LMICs is 16 times higher than in general
  populations (6.2% prevalence rate), reflecting the concentration of individuals with serious mental
  illness within carceral systems due to inadequate community mental health infrastructure.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects the criminalization of mental illness in resource-poor
    settings. The structural root cause is inadequate investment in community mental health services,
    leading to the prison system becoming a de facto psychiatric institution. The 16-fold prevalence ratio
    indicates massive unmet mental health needs that are being addressed through incarceration rather
    than treatment.
