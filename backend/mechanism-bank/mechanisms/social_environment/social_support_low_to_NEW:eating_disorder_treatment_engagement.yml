mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with eating disorders lack positive social support networks'
- 'Step 2: Absence of supportive family, friends, or peer relationships reduces encouragement to seek
  help'
- 'Step 3: Patients lack practical support for treatment logistics (transportation, childcare, emotional
  support)'
- 'Step 4: Without positive reinforcement from social networks, help-seeking behavior is diminished'

description: Positive social support was cited as the most prominent facilitator to promote help-seeking
  for eating disorder treatment. This finding was consistent across patient, caregiver, and clinician
  perspectives, indicating social environment plays a critical role in treatment engagement.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes the role of social capital and community networks in
    healthcare access. Social support is not merely an individual characteristic but is shaped by structural
    factors including community cohesion, family resources, and availability of peer support programs.
    Interventions such as positive peer-support programs are recommended as structural solutions.
