description: The study identified parental role modeling as an important factor influencing adolescent
  alcohol use. Adolescents recommended positive role modeling by parents as part of comprehensive strategies
  to reduce underage drinking, suggesting that family social environment shapes drinking behaviors beyond
  policy interventions.

  equity_implications: 'While this mechanism involves family dynamics, it should be understood within
    broader structural contexts: parental alcohol use patterns are themselves shaped by social stressors,
    economic conditions, and community norms. Interventions should support families rather than blame
    individual parents. Community-level and policy approaches to changing alcohol norms are more equitable
    than individual-focused interventions.'
