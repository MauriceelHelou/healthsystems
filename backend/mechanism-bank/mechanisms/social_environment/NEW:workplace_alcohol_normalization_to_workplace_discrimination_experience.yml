mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Professional networking events (''happy hours'') are structured around alcohol consumption
  as an invisible organizational norm'
- 'Step 2: This norm creates an implicit expectation of alcohol participation for career advancement'
- 'Step 3: Religious minorities who abstain from alcohol (e.g., Muslims) face exclusion from informal
  networking opportunities'
- 'Step 4: Despite physical presence at events, non-drinkers experience social marginalization within
  the group'
- 'Step 5: This structural barrier reinforces inequality regimes in organizations and limits career progression'

description: 'Organizational networking practices centered on alcohol consumption (''happy hours'') create
  structural barriers for religious minorities who abstain from drinking. British Muslim women experience
  a paradox: they feel compelled to attend these events for career advancement, but their non-participation
  in drinking results in feelings of exclusion and marginalization even when present. This demonstrates
  how seemingly neutral organizational practices can inadvertently reinforce inequality regimes.'

  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately traces workplace inequality to structural organizational
    norms rather than individual deficits. The paper identifies 'happy hours' as an invisible, legitimized
    practice (per Acker's inequality regime framework) that appears neutral but systematically disadvantages
    religious minorities. The mechanism avoids blaming Muslim women for their exclusion and instead highlights
    how alcohol-centered networking constitutes a structural barrier. Equity implications include the
    need for organizations to recognize how embedded cultural practices around alcohol create differential
    access to career advancement opportunities based on religious identity.
