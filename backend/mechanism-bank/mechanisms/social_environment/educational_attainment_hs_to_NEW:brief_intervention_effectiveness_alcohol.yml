direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with lower educational attainment may have less exposure to health education about
  alcohol risks'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions provide structured education and feedback that may be novel and impactful
  for this population'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare encounter creates unique opportunity for intervention delivery regardless of treatment-seeking
  status'
- 'Step 4: Lower baseline exposure to similar interventions may increase relative impact'
- 'Step 5: Greater reductions in alcohol consumption frequency at follow-up'

description: Brief interventions produced larger reductions in alcohol consumption frequency at 3-month
  follow-up for individuals with less than a high school education compared to those with higher educational

  equity_implications: This is a critical health equity finding. Educational attainment is a fundamental
    social determinant of health that reflects and perpetuates structural inequalities. The enhanced effectiveness
    of brief interventions among those with lower education suggests this approach may help reduce rather
    than exacerbate health disparities. This contrasts with many interventions that show greater effects
    among more advantaged populations. Investment in healthcare-based brief interventions may represent
    a strategy for achieving more equitable alcohol-related health outcomes.
