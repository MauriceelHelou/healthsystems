direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness exposes individuals to extreme psychological stressors including
  loss of stable housing, social disconnection, and daily survival challenges'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable shelter increases exposure to traumatic experiences, violence,
  and harsh environmental conditions that compound psychological distress'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to mental health services and healthy coping mechanisms
  among homeless populations increases vulnerability to self-medication with alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Street culture and social networks among homeless populations may normalize
  and facilitate alcohol use as a coping strategy'
- 'Step 5: Chronic stress, untreated mental health conditions, and environmental factors
  contribute to development and maintenance of alcohol use disorder'

description: Homeless populations show exceptionally high rates of alcohol use disorder
  (36.7% prevalence), making it the most common psychiatric diagnosis among homeless
  individuals in high-income countries. This meta-analysis of 39 studies with 8,049
  participants demonstrates that homelessness is strongly associated with alcohol
  use disorder, likely through pathways involving chronic stress, trauma exposure,
  limited healthcare access, and environmental factors unique to street living.
