  description: The authors emphasize that intersectionality of race, gender, and class must be considered
    when addressing treatment barriers, though this was not explicitly addressed in the reviewed articles
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The authors explicitly call for intersectional analysis, recognizing that African-American
    women's treatment barriers cannot be understood through single-axis frameworks. This represents a
    structural competency approach that acknowledges how multiple systems of oppression interact to produce
    health inequities in treatment access and outcomes.
