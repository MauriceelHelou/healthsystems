description: Mass media campaigns show mixed evidence of achieving changes in intentions, motivation,
  beliefs and attitudes about alcohol. The inconsistent findings suggest that attitudinal change alone
  is insufficient to drive population-level consumption reduction.

  variation_notes: Studies conducted in developed countries; cultural context likely influences attitudinal
    change

  description: Different campaign approaches may have varying effects on attitudes versus beliefs versus
    intentions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Focusing on attitude change places responsibility on individuals to change their
    thinking rather than addressing the structural conditions (pricing, availability, marketing saturation)
    that shape alcohol consumption environments. This represents a limited approach that may not address
    root causes of harmful drinking patterns.
