mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social media drinking challenges normalize extreme alcohol consumption behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Competitive escalation leads to consumption of ''deadly cocktails'' and dangerous mixtures'
- 'Step 3: Severe acute alcohol poisoning develops requiring intensive medical care'
- 'Step 4: Patients require hospitalization beyond initial ED treatment, including semi-intensive care'

description: Among the 199 patients (44.2% of total) who required immediate medical attention upon ED
  admission (red/yellow triage codes), approximately 14% required additional medical assistance or hospitalization
  beyond the ED, with some admitted to semi-intensive care units. This demonstrates the severe health
  consequences of social media-driven drinking challenges.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The escalating severity reflects structural failures in platform content moderation,
    absence of public health warnings about viral challenges, and lack of coordinated response between
    technology companies and public health authorities. Five documented deaths globally indicate this
    is a serious public health issue requiring systemic intervention.
