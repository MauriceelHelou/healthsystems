mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social drinking contexts expose individuals to peer drinking norms and behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Group drinking dynamics create social pressure to match consumption levels of others'
- 'Step 3: Larger groups or groups with heavier drinkers establish higher consumption norms'
- 'Step 4: Social facilitation effects increase individual consumption beyond solitary drinking levels'

description: Drinking group characteristics are important drivers of heavy drinking occasions. Social

  and group dynamics.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how social environments shape drinking behavior rather
    than purely individual choice. Social network structures and community drinking cultures represent
    structural factors. Interventions targeting social norms and drinking environments address upstream
    causes.
