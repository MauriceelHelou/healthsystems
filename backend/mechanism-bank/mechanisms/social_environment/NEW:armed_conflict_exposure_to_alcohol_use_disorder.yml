mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Armed conflict creates population displacement, economic destruction, and social disruption
  in low- and middle-income countries'
- 'Step 2: Conflict-affected populations experience cumulative trauma events including violence exposure,
  loss of family members, and destruction of livelihoods'
- 'Step 3: Trauma exposure leads to psychological distress, depression, and maladaptive coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Harmful alcohol use emerges as a coping response to trauma and ongoing stressors in conflict-affected
  settings'
- 'Step 5: Limited access to mental health services and alcohol treatment in conflict settings perpetuates
  harmful drinking patterns'

description: Armed conflict in low- and middle-income countries poses potential risks for harmful alcohol
  use among over 200 million affected civilians including refugees, internally displaced persons, and
  conflict-affected residents remaining in their communities. The systematic review identified associations
  between conflict exposure and harmful alcohol use, with male gender, older age, cumulative trauma exposure,
  and depression as associated risk factors.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism properly locates the root cause in structural violence (armed conflict)
    rather than individual choices. Armed conflict represents a fundamental breakdown of social, economic,
    and political structures that creates conditions for harmful alcohol use. The lack of intervention
    studies highlights the failure of health systems to address alcohol harm in conflict-affected populations.
    Equity implications include disproportionate impacts on populations in low- and middle-income countries
    with limited health infrastructure to respond to both conflict trauma and substance use disorders.
