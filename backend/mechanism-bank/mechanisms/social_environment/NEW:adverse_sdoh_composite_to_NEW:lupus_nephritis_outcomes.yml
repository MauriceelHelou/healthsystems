direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple adverse SDoH domains (economic, educational, healthcare access, social, neighborhood)
  create cumulative disadvantage'
- 'Step 2: Each additional adverse SDoH domain compounds risk through multiplicative rather than additive
  effects'
- 'Step 3: Compounded disadvantage leads to delayed diagnosis, suboptimal treatment adherence, and reduced
  access to specialist care'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress from multiple adverse SDoH triggers inflammatory pathways and immune dysregulation'
- 'Step 5: Worsened disease activity and progression to adverse outcomes including end-stage renal disease'

description: Overall burden of adverse social determinants of health demonstrates multiplicative impact
  on lupus nephritis outcomes, suggesting compounding effects across domains rather than simple additive
  risk

- name: Number of adverse SDoH domains

  description: Multiplicative effect indicates each additional adverse SDoH domain compounds rather than
    simply adds to risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately frames lupus nephritis disparities as products of
    structural inequities across multiple SDoH domains rather than individual patient behaviors. The multiplicative
    framework emphasizes how systems of disadvantage compound to produce health inequities. Interventions
    targeting single domains may be insufficient; structural approaches addressing multiple domains simultaneously
    are needed.
