direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Racial/ethnic minority status is associated with structural racism and historical discrimination
  in healthcare and housing'
- 'Step 2: These structural factors lead to reduced access to quality primary care and preventive services'
- 'Step 3: Decreased access to guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure management'
- 'Step 4: Poorer disease control and symptom management leading to acute decompensation'
- 'Step 5: Increased heart failure hospitalizations and readmissions'

description: Systematic review of 59 studies found race and ethnicity were among the most commonly examined
  SDoH variables affecting heart failure outcomes including hospitalizations and readmissions, though
  effects were inconsistent due to measurement heterogeneity
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects were inconsistent across studies due to heterogeneity of data sources and SDoH
    constructs, suggesting geographic and methodological variation

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately traces to structural racism and systemic inequities
    rather than individual behaviors. Race/ethnicity serves as a proxy for exposure to structural barriers
    including residential segregation, discriminatory healthcare practices, and differential access to
    resources. The review highlights that poor measurement of SDoH limits ability to design interventions
    addressing root causes.
