description: Adaptive digital learning environments support socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL)
  in collaborative contexts. SSRL involves group-level regulatory activities including planning, monitoring,
  controlling, and reflecting on collective learning processes. The review identifies this as a distinct
  construct from individual self-regulated learning that emerges in collaborative settings.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism examines how structural features of learning environments (technology
    design, collaborative settings) shape collective regulatory capacities. The focus on shared regulation
    recognizes learning as a social process influenced by environmental structures rather than purely
    individual traits. This has implications for designing equitable educational technologies that support
    collaborative learning across diverse groups.
