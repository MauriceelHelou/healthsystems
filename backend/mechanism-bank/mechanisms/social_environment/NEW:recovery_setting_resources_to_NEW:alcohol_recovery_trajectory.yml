  description: Spirituality and religion dimension identified as component of recovery narratives, suggesting
    faith-based resources may moderate recovery success
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Recovery settings represent a structural determinant as access to formal treatment,
    recovery housing, peer support programs, and community resources varies significantly by socioeconomic
    status, geographic location, and insurance coverage. The framework's inclusion of recovery setting
    as a dimension acknowledges that structural factors shape recovery possibilities, though the study
    does not explicitly analyze disparities in recovery setting access.
