- 'Step 1: Pandemic creates pervasive threat environment with uncertain disease transmission risks'
- 'Step 2: Information overload and misinformation amplify fear and uncertainty'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare system strain reduces access to care and increases health anxiety'
- 'Step 4: Economic precarity and job insecurity generate chronic worry about future'
- 'Step 5: Prolonged exposure to threat and uncertainty manifests as anxiety symptoms'

description: The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with elevated anxiety symptoms in the Bangladeshi population,
  with pooled prevalence estimates reported in the meta-analysis alongside depression and stress outcomes.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Bangladesh-specific findings; anxiety prevalence likely influenced by local pandemic
    severity, government response, and baseline mental health infrastructure

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Anxiety during the pandemic reflects structural determinants including inadequate
    public health communication systems, limited mental health services, economic vulnerability of informal
    workers, and healthcare system capacity constraints. The mechanism emphasizes systemic rather than
    individual factors in anxiety development.
