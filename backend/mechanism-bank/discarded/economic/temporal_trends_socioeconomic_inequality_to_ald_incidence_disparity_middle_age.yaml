  node_name: ALD Incidence Disparity in Middle-Aged Adults (55-74 years)
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic policies and austerity measures between 2001-2018 disproportionately
  affected lower socioeconomic groups, increasing material deprivation and chronic
  stress'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol industry marketing and pricing policies increased alcohol availability
  and affordability, with greater impact in deprived communities'
- 'Step 3: Cuts to social services and community support systems reduced protective
  factors against harmful alcohol use in deprived areas'
- 'Step 4: Middle-aged cohorts experienced cumulative exposure to widening economic
  inequality over their adult lives, translating to sustained harmful alcohol consumption
  patterns'
- 'Step 5: The combination of sustained exposure and aging liver vulnerability produced
  accelerating ALD incidence rates particularly in deprived populations'

- name: age_group
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The 55-74 year age group showed particularly notable increases in ALD
    incidence rates, with most deprived quintile increasing from 96.1 to 158 per 100,000
    (64% increase) and least deprived from 32.5 to 70.0 (115% increase), though absolute
    burden remained much higher in deprived groups
- name: baseline_deprivation_level
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: While all quintiles showed increases, the most deprived quintile maintained
    persistently higher absolute incidence rates throughout the study period (158
    vs 70 per 100,000 in 2018)
