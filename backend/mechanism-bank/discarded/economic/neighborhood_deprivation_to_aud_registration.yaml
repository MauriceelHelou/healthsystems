direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhood deprivation concentrates economic disadvantage, limiting access
  to protective resources including quality healthcare, recreational facilities, and
  employment opportunities'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress from living in resource-deprived environments increases
  psychological distress and reduces coping resources'
- 'Step 3: Higher density of alcohol outlets and fewer protective institutions in
  deprived areas increases environmental availability and exposure to alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Combination of heightened stress, reduced protective factors, and increased
  availability elevates risk of AUD development requiring medical or criminal system
  registration'
