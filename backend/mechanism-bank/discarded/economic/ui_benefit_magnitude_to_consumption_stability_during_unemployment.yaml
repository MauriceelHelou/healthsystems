direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Enhanced UI benefits (regular state benefits plus $600 supplement) provide
  income replacement that meets or exceeds prior wage levels'
- 'Step 2: Adequate income replacement prevents liquidity constraints and depletion
  of savings'
- 'Step 3: Unemployed households maintain purchasing power for essential goods and
  services'
- 'Step 4: Consumption patterns remain stable or increase rather than declining as
  typically occurs with unemployment'
