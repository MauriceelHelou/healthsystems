direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increase in alcohol prices reduces affordability of alcoholic beverages
  for consumers'
- 'Step 2: Reduced affordability creates economic constraint on quantity of alcohol
  that can be purchased within household budgets'
- 'Step 3: Economic constraint leads to decreased quantity of pure alcohol purchased
  and consumed from off-premises retailers'
- 'Step 4: Lower alcohol consumption reduces population-level exposure to alcohol
  and associated health harms'
