direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: DWI-convicted drivers face mandatory IID installation with associated financial
  costs (installation, maintenance, monitoring fees)'
- 'Step 2: Financial burdens create barriers to compliance, particularly for economically
  disadvantaged drivers'
- 'Step 3: Drivers unable or unwilling to pay elect license suspension/revocation
  instead of IID installation'
- 'Step 4: Non-installation perpetuates high-risk driving behaviors in this subsample'
