direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare facilities implement demanding work schedules with limited breaks
  and long shifts for nursing staff'
- 'Step 2: Time constraints and work intensity reduce available time for meal preparation,
  physical activity, and rest'
- 'Step 3: Chronic time poverty creates structural barriers to accessing healthy food
  options and engaging in regular exercise'
- 'Step 4: Nurses experience reduced capacity to maintain health promoting behaviors
  including healthy dietary patterns and physical activity'
