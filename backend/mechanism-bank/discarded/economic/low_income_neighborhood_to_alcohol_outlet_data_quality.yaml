direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-income areas experience systematic underfunding of administrative infrastructure
  and regulatory oversight capacity'
- 'Step 2: Reduced municipal resources lead to inadequate maintenance and updating
  of business licensing databases'
- 'Step 3: Lower regulatory enforcement allows unlicensed or improperly documented
  alcohol outlets to operate'
- 'Step 4: Multiple data systems fail to capture or reconcile outlet information,
  creating greater discrepancies between local, state, and national databases'
- 'Step 5: Poor data quality undermines targeted interventions and policy enforcement
  in communities that may face highest alcohol-related harms'

  description: Urban areas show fewer data discrepancies (IR=0.378, p<0.01), suggesting
    better administrative infrastructure partially protects against data quality problems
    even in low-income urban neighborhoods

  strength: strong
  description: Oregon showed minimal variation between data sources (1.09-1.22), suggesting
    state-level investment in data systems can reduce socioeconomic disparities in
    data quality
