direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol taxes raise retail prices of alcoholic beverages across
  commercial establishments'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices reduce overall alcohol consumption particularly among price-sensitive
  populations including young adults and heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Reduced drinking occasions and lower consumption per occasion decreases
  likelihood of reaching BAC levels associated with impairment'
- 'Step 4: Lower prevalence of alcohol impairment in population reduces opportunities
  and instances of impaired driving'
