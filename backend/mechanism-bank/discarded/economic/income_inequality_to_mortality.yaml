  node_id: income_inequality
  node_name: Income Inequality
to_node:
  node_id: mortality
  node_name: All-Cause Mortality
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Income inequality creates steeper social gradients and status hierarchies
  within populations'
- 'Step 2: Status hierarchies generate psychosocial stress through social comparison
  and status anxiety'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress exposure leads to physiological dysregulation and increased
  disease risk'
- 'Step 4: Unequal distribution of resources limits access to health-protective factors
  for lower-income populations'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effects of stress and resource deprivation increase mortality
  risk'
