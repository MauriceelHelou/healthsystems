direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SAWS is costly to treat in hospital settings, particularly when requiring
  critical care'
- 'Step 2: High treatment costs strain hospital resources and create financial burden
  on healthcare systems'
- 'Step 3: Despite high costs, SAWS research receives relatively low priority and
  funding compared to other conditions'
- 'Step 4: Insufficient research perpetuates suboptimal care practices and maintains
  high costs'
