- 'Step 1: Job loss in stable economic periods occurs with better prospects for re-employment
  and less severe financial consequences'
- 'Step 2: Stronger labor market conditions provide alternative employment options,
  reducing duration and intensity of stress'
- 'Step 3: Better social safety net adequacy during non-crisis periods may buffer
  psychological and financial impacts'
- 'Step 4: Reduced chronic stress from unemployment limits development of harmful
  drinking patterns'
