direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bartenders and rum shopkeepers depend on alcohol sales revenue for economic
  livelihood'
- 'Step 2: Economic pressure creates incentive to maximize sales volume including
  to already intoxicated customers'
- 'Step 3: In absence of policy mandates or enforcement, economic incentives outweigh
  moral motivations to refuse service'
- 'Step 4: Servers continue serving alcohol to visibly intoxicated patrons to maintain
  revenue'
- 'Step 5: Continued alcohol consumption among intoxicated patrons increases levels
  of disinhibition and associated harms'
