- 'Step 1: Income inequality creates stratified social environments with differential
  access to health resources and opportunities'
- 'Step 2: Greater inequality intensifies relative deprivation and social comparison
  processes'
- 'Step 3: Perception of low relative status and limited opportunities generates chronic
  psychosocial stress and reduced sense of control'

  and wellbeing'
- 'Step 5: Unequal societies may also underinvest in public health infrastructure
  affecting population health perceptions'
