direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Livestock production requires extensive land conversion for pasture and
  feed crop production, driving deforestation and habitat destruction'
- 'Step 2: Loss of biodiversity reduces ecosystem resilience and disrupts ecological
  services'
- 'Step 3: Biodiversity loss increases risk of zoonotic disease emergence through
  altered host-pathogen dynamics and increased human-wildlife contact'
- 'Step 4: Emerging infectious diseases create direct population health threats through
  novel pathogen exposure'
