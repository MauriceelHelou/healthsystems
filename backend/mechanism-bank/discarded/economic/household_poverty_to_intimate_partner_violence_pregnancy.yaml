  node_name: Intimate Partner Violence During Pregnancy
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic deprivation creates chronic household stress and resource scarcity,
  increasing interpersonal tensions'
- 'Step 2: Poverty limits women''s economic autonomy and ability to leave violent
  situations, creating structural entrapment'
- 'Step 3: Financial stress may trigger or exacerbate partner alcohol use and other
  maladaptive coping behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Lack of resources reduces access to legal protection, healthcare, and social
  support systems that could prevent or mitigate violence'
- 'Step 5: Pregnancy increases economic vulnerability and dependence, amplifying exposure
  to violence in contexts of poverty'
