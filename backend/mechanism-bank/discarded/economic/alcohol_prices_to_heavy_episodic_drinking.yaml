direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol prices reduce affordability of alcohol products for youth
  with limited financial resources'
- 'Step 2: Economic barriers delay age of alcohol use initiation among youth populations'
- 'Step 3: Later initiation occurs during periods of greater neurological maturity
  and impulse control'
- 'Step 4: Youth who initiate drinking at older ages establish less harmful consumption
  patterns'
- 'Step 5: Sustained higher prices continue to constrain purchasing power for heavy
  consumption episodes'
