  node_name: Net Societal Loss from Alcohol Use
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State governments collect excise taxes from alcohol sales as revenue source,
  creating fiscal dependence on alcohol industry'
- 'Step 2: Revenue generation priorities potentially conflict with public health objectives
  to reduce alcohol consumption through higher taxation'
- 'Step 3: Lower taxation maintains alcohol affordability and market access, generating
  tax revenue but enabling higher consumption'
- 'Step 4: Health costs from alcohol-attributable disease burden (valued at 6.2 trillion
  INR) substantially exceed tax revenue collected (1.8 trillion INR)'
- 'Step 5: Net societal loss of 4.4 trillion INR represents the economic shortfall
  where health externalities are not captured through fiscal policy'
