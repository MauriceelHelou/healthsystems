direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical policies and practices (redlining, discriminatory lending, reduced
  public investment) create systematically disinvested neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Disinvestment results in lower property values, reduced economic opportunity,
  and deteriorated infrastructure in these neighborhoods'
- 'Step 3: Lower property values and ''development potential'' make these neighborhoods
  attractive targets for capital investment and speculation'
- 'Step 4: Areas become classified as ''gentrifiable'' - neighborhoods with low socioeconomic
  status that become targets for influx of higher-SES residents and capital'
