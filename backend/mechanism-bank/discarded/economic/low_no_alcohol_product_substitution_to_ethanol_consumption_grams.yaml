direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low and no-alcohol products enter the beverage market as alternatives to
  regular-strength products'
- 'Step 2: Market data from Great Britain suggests these products replace rather than
  supplement higher-strength beer sales'
- 'Step 3: Replacement purchases reduce the total grams of ethanol purchased at population
  level'
- 'Step 4: Reduced ethanol purchases translate to decreased ethanol consumption and
  associated health risks'
