direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Meat consumption taxes increase the price of meat products at point of
  purchase'
- 'Step 2: Higher meat prices create economic incentive to reduce meat consumption
  and shift toward alternative protein sources'
- 'Step 3: Reduced meat consumption decreases exposure to adverse health effects associated
  with high meat intake (cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, metabolic disorders)'
- 'Step 4: Population-level dietary shifts toward less meat consumption improve aggregate
  public health outcomes'
