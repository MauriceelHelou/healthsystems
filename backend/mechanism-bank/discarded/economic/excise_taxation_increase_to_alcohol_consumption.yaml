  node_name: Increase in Alcohol Excise Taxation
to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_consumption
  node_name: Alcohol Consumption
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased excise taxation raises the retail price of alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices reduce affordability of alcohol, particularly for price-sensitive
  consumers'
- 'Step 3: Reduced affordability leads to decreased purchasing and consumption of
  alcohol at population level'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption decreases overall alcohol exposure and related health
  harms'

  description: Political resistance to large tax increases limits the magnitude of
    taxation that can be implemented, reducing potential public health impact
