direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower income creates chronic economic stress and reduces access to health-promoting
  resources'
- 'Step 2: Economic disadvantage increases exposure to cardiovascular risk factors
  including poor nutrition, environmental hazards, and occupational stressors'
- 'Step 3: Lower-income neighborhoods have reduced access to preventive cardiology
  services and cardiac rehabilitation'
- 'Step 4: Financial barriers delay cardiac care-seeking and reduce medication adherence
  for cardiovascular conditions'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative cardiovascular damage and inadequate treatment increase ischemic
  heart disease mortality'
