direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low socioeconomic status creates chronic financial stress, housing instability,
  and limited access to resources'
- 'Step 2: Economic hardship increases maternal psychological distress and reduces
  capacity for emotional regulation'
- 'Step 3: Stress and resource scarcity may impair cognitive functioning and emotion
  processing abilities'
- 'Step 4: However, the study found no significant moderation effect of SES on the
  relationship between emotion recognition and maltreatment, suggesting other factors
  may be more proximal'
