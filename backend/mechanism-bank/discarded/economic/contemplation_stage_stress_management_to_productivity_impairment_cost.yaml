direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workplace conditions create stress levels sufficient that employees recognize
  need for stress management and contemplate behavior change'
- 'Step 2: Contemplation stage indicates current stress levels are not being adequately
  addressed by existing workplace supports or personal resources'
- 'Step 3: Unmanaged stress during contemplation period continues to impair cognitive
  function and work performance'
- 'Step 4: Ongoing productivity deficits accumulate to economic costs exceeding $50,000
  annually per employee in contemplation stage'
