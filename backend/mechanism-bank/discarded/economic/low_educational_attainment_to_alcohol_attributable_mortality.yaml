direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low educational attainment limits access to stable, well-paying employment
  and creates economic precarity'
- 'Step 2: Limited socioeconomic resources reduce access to quality healthcare, alcohol
  treatment services, and supportive social networks'
- 'Step 3: Economic stress and limited resources increase vulnerability to alcohol-related
  health conditions and reduce capacity for harm reduction'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative disadvantage leads to higher rates of alcohol-attributable mortality
  through chronic disease burden and acute alcohol-related deaths'
