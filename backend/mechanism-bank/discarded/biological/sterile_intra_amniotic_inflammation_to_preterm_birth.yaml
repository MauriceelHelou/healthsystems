  node_id: preterm_birth
  node_name: Preterm Birth
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alarmins (danger signals) are released in the intra-amniotic cavity without
  microbial infection'
- 'Step 2: Alarmins trigger inflammatory immune responses similar to but distinct
  from infection-driven inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory cascade activates preterm labor mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Labor processes lead to preterm delivery and associated neonatal outcomes'
