  node_id: alcohol_related_dementia
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Dementia
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive alcohol exposure causes direct neurotoxic effects on
  brain tissue'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts thiamine metabolism and absorption, leading to nutritional
  deficiencies'
- 'Step 3: Sustained neurotoxicity and thiamine deficiency result in progressive cognitive
  impairment and dementia symptoms'

  strength: strong
  description: Older people with long histories of heavy drinking are specifically
    noted as having difficulty with abstinence, suggesting cumulative exposure strengthens
    the mechanism
- name: thiamine_treatment
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Thiamine treatment may prevent or improve symptoms, indicating that
    addressing nutritional deficiency can moderate the pathway
- name: alcohol_abstinence
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Abstinence from alcohol is noted as critical, suggesting cessation
    of exposure can prevent progression or improve outcomes
