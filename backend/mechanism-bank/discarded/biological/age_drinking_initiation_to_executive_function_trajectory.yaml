direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure beginning at age 13 occurs during critical prefrontal
  cortex development and executive function maturation'
- 'Step 2: Early initiation extends total duration of alcohol exposure during vulnerable
  developmental period'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged exposure during brain development disrupts normal trajectory
  of executive function improvement that occurs naturally through adolescence'
- 'Step 4: While control subjects show stable and robust improvement in executive
  performance with age, BD subjects show less stable improvement patterns'
