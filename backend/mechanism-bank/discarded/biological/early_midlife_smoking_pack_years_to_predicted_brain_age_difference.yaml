  node_id: predicted_brain_age_difference
  node_name: Predicted Brain Age Difference (Advanced Brain Aging)
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavier cigarette smoking in early mid-life (age 40) creates cumulative
  toxic exposures affecting cerebrovascular integrity'
- 'Step 2: Chronic nicotine and tobacco toxin exposure causes oxidative stress and
  inflammation in brain tissue'
- 'Step 3: Vascular damage and neuroinflammation accelerate brain atrophy and structural
  deterioration'
- 'Step 4: By age 56 (16 years later), measurable brain aging advancement is detected
  via structural MRI as older predicted brain age relative to chronological age'
