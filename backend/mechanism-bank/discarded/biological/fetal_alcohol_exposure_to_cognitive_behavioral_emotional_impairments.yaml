category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during fetal development disrupts neurodevelopmental processes
  including neuronal migration, synaptic formation, and brain structure development'
- 'Step 2: Teratogenic effects on developing central nervous system alter neural circuitry
  and brain function'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted neurodevelopment persists postnatally as structural and functional
  brain alterations'
- 'Step 4: Brain alterations manifest as life-long cognitive, behavioral, and emotional
  impairments characteristic of FASD'
