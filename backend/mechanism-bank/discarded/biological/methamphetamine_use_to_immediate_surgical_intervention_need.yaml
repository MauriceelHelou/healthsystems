direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Methamphetamine use increases likelihood of penetrating trauma from gun
  and knife violence, which typically causes severe tissue damage'
- 'Step 2: Penetrating injuries to vital organs, major vessels, or body cavities require
  urgent surgical exploration and repair'
- 'Step 3: Time-sensitive nature of hemorrhage control and definitive treatment necessitates
  immediate operative intervention'
