  node_id: alcohol_abuse_dependence
  node_name: Alcohol Abuse or Dependence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute ischemic stroke creates neuropsychiatric vulnerability through damage
  to reward circuits and impulse control regions'
- 'Step 2: Stroke-induced changes in neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, GABA) may
  unmask or exacerbate alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol abuse/dependence may represent pre-existing condition that contributed
  to stroke risk (bidirectional relationship)'
- 'Step 4: Post-stroke distress and disability may trigger maladaptive coping including
  problematic alcohol use'
