to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Specific genetic variants exert direct biological effects on neurobiological
  pathways involved in alcohol dependence and addiction'
- 'Step 2: These genetic effects operate independently of alcohol consumption levels,
  affecting reward pathways, craving mechanisms, or metabolic responses to alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with these genetic variants experience increased susceptibility
  to transition from heavy drinking to clinically significant alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: The genetic architecture creates biological vulnerability that interacts
  with environmental exposures to produce differential risk of AUD across populations'

- name: ancestry
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Study identifies ancestry-specific loci (5 for AUD, 3 for AUDIT-C),
    indicating genetic effects vary by ancestral background and may interact with
    population-specific environmental or structural factors
- name: abstinence_status
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Exclusion of abstinent individuals reveals additional genetic loci
    (7 additional for AUD, 8 for AUDIT-C), suggesting heterogeneity in the abstinent
    group affects genetic signal detection
