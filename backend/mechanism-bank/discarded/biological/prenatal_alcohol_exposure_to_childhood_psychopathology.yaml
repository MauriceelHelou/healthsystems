direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy exposes developing fetus
  to ethanol'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol crosses placental barrier and disrupts fetal neurodevelopment'
- 'Step 3: Altered brain structure development (increased cerebral and regional volume)
  occurs'
- 'Step 4: Structural brain differences partially mediate increased psychopathological
  symptoms in childhood'
