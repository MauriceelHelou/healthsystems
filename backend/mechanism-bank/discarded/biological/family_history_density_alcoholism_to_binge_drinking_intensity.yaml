to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking_intensity
  node_name: Binge and High-Intensity Drinking Behavior
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of family history of alcoholism (FHD) creates genetic and
  epigenetic predisposition to altered alcohol metabolism and reward processing'
- 'Step 2: This biological predisposition influences individual patterns of alcohol
  self-administration, particularly the rate at which alcohol concentration is increased'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with higher FHD demonstrate faster rates of reaching target
  breath alcohol concentrations (80 mg/dl) in controlled settings'
- 'Step 4: This faster rate of alcohol self-administration translates to higher multiples
  of binge drinking definition in real-world drinking contexts'
