mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<30%) indicates compromised
  cardiac pump function and reduced cardiac output'
- 'Step 2: Diminished cardiac output leads to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen
  delivery to vital organs'
- 'Step 3: Chronic hypoperfusion results in multi-organ dysfunction and hemodynamic
  instability'
- 'Step 4: Progressive cardiac decompensation and organ failure increase risk of death'

  description: The relationship between LVEF and death differed significantly by HF
    etiology (interaction p=0.0010). In ischemic HF and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy,
    there was a continuous inverse association between LVEF and mortality, but in
    hypertensive, valvular and other HF types, no association was found.
