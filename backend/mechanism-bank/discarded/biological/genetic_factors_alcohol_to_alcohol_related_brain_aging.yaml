  node_name: Alcohol-Related Advanced Brain Aging
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heritable genetic factors influence individual vulnerability to neurotoxic
  effects of alcohol on brain structure'
- 'Step 2: Genetic variations affecting alcohol metabolism, neurotransmitter systems,
  or neuroplasticity modulate the brain''s response to alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 3: Within-twin-pair analyses reveal that genetic factors partially explain
  why some individuals experience greater alcohol-related brain aging than others
  with similar exposure levels'
- 'Step 4: Gene-environment interactions determine magnitude of brain aging advancement
  following alcohol consumption'
