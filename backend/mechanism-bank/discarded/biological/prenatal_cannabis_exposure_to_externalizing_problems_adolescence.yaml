direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis exposure during prenatal period disrupts fetal neurodevelopmental
  processes through effects on endocannabinoid system'
- 'Step 2: Altered brain development affects regulatory systems involved in impulse
  control and behavioral inhibition'
- 'Step 3: Developmental changes persist through childhood without observable differences
  in response inhibition on fMRI Stop Signal Task'
- 'Step 4: By early adolescence, exposed children show significantly elevated externalizing
  behaviors including aggression, rule-breaking, and impulsivity'
