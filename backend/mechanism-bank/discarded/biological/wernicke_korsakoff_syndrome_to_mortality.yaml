mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome causes severe cognitive impairment affecting
  memory, executive function, and judgment'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive deficits impair self-care capacity and ability to manage comorbid
  medical conditions'

  cardiovascular events leads to elevated mortality risk'
