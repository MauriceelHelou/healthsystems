direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: TNF inhibitors reduce innate immune system magnitude and responsiveness'
- 'Step 2: Dampened immune surveillance increases vulnerability to environmental bacterial
  pathogens'
- 'Step 3: Legionella pneumophila infections occur at 13-21 times the rate of the
  general population among TNF inhibitor recipients'
