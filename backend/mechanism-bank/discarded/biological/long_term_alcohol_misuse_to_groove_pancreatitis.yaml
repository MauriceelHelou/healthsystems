  node_id: groove_pancreatitis

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes repeated toxic injury to pancreatic acinar
  cells in the periampullary region'
- 'Step 2: Inflammation concentrates in the groove area between the pancreatic head
  and duodenal C loop'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis and scarring develop in the groove area, leading to
  chronic focal pancreatitis'
- 'Step 4: Structural changes result in main pancreatic duct dilatation, cyst formation,
  and biliary tract enlargement'
