direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: A single binge drinking episode during gestational weeks 3-4 creates acute
  high-dose alcohol exposure during a critical window of embryonic development'
- 'Step 2: High blood alcohol concentration during this period disrupts neural crest
  cell migration and facial primordium formation'
- 'Step 3: Even brief exposure during this sensitive developmental window can permanently
  alter craniofacial morphogenesis'
- 'Step 4: Resulting facial dysmorphology manifests as measurable FAS/PFAS phenotypic
  features by age 5 years'

  description: Binge episodes during gestational weeks 3-4 appear particularly harmful
    as this is a critical period for facial development; many women may not yet know
    they are pregnant during this window
