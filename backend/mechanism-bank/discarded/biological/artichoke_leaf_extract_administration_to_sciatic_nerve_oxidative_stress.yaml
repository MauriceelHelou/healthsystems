direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Artichoke leaf extract (800 mg/kg) is administered orally for 21 days following
  chronic constriction injury'
- 'Step 2: Bioactive compounds in the extract decrease lipid peroxidation in sciatic
  nerve tissue'
- 'Step 3: The extract restores antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and GPx) in the
  sciatic nerve'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced antioxidant capacity reduces overall oxidative stress in damaged
  nerve tissue'

- name: dose_level
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Only the 800 mg/kg dose showed significant effects; 200 and 400 mg/kg
    doses did not affect oxidative stress markers or behavioral outcomes
- name: treatment_duration
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Significant effects emerged at day 7 for mechanical allodynia and day
    14 for thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia, suggesting time-dependent accumulation
    of antioxidant benefits
