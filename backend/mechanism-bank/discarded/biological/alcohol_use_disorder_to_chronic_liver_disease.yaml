direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol use disorder engage in chronic excessive alcohol
  intake'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes hepatotoxicity through oxidative stress
  and inflammatory pathways'
- 'Step 3: Progressive liver damage manifests as steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis,
  and/or hepatocellular carcinoma'
- 'Step 4: Approximately 35% of patients with AUD will develop some degree of chronic
  liver disease'
