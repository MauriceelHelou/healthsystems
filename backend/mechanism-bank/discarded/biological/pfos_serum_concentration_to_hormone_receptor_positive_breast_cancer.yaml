  node_id: hormone_receptor_positive_breast_cancer
  node_name: Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer (ER+/PR+)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PFOS acts as an endocrine-disrupting chemical that interferes with hormonal
  signaling pathways'
- 'Step 2: Disruption of estrogen and progesterone receptor pathways promotes cellular
  proliferation in hormone-sensitive breast tissue'
- 'Step 3: Persistent exposure to PFOS through contaminated water, food, and consumer
  products leads to sustained endocrine disruption'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated endocrine disruption increases risk of hormone receptor-positive
  tumor development in postmenopausal women'

- name: hormone_receptor_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: PFOS association specifically elevated for ER+/PR+ tumors (OR=2.19,
    95% CI 1.21-3.98) but not for overall breast cancer risk, suggesting hormonal
    pathway-specific mechanism
- name: exposure_quartile
  direction: u_shaped
  strength: moderate
  description: Third quartile showed strongest association with ER+/PR+ tumors (OR=2.19),
    while fourth quartile showed elevated but non-statistically significant ORs, suggesting
    possible non-linear dose-response
