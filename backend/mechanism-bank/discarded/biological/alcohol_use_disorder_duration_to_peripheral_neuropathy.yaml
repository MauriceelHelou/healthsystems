  node_id: peripheral_neuropathy
  node_name: Peripheral Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prolonged alcohol exposure leads to accumulation of toxic metabolites and
  nutritional deficiencies (particularly thiamine)'
- 'Step 2: Chronic toxicity causes progressive damage to both small and large nerve
  fibers through oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Axonal degeneration occurs in a length-dependent pattern, affecting distal
  nerves first'
- 'Step 4: Nerve damage manifests as measurable reductions in sensory nerve action
  potentials and sympathetic skin responses'
