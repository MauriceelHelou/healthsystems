mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of regular or problematic alcohol use (reported by 21% of
  participants) creates genetic predisposition and environmental modeling'
- 'Step 2: Familial alcohol use patterns contribute to higher Transmissible Liability
  Index scores in offspring'
- 'Step 3: Higher TLI scores are associated with earlier age of onset of drinking'
- 'Step 4: Earlier drinking initiation increases risk for alcohol use and problems
  during late adolescence and college transition'
