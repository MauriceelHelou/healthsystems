  node_id: th1_cell_differentiation
  node_name: Type 1 T Helper (Th1) Cell Differentiation
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PEA lipid mediator is administered as a therapeutic intervention'
- 'Step 2: PEA inhibits expression of master transcription factors crucial for Th1
  cell differentiation'
- 'Step 3: Reduced transcription factor expression suppresses Th1 cell development'
- 'Step 4: Decreased Th1 cells reduces pathogenic T cell responses associated with
  autoimmune diseases'
