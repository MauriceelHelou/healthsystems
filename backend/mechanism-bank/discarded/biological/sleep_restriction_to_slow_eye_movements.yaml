direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep restriction reduces total sleep time to 3 hours in laboratory setting'
- 'Step 2: Reduced sleep creates physiological sleepiness markers'
- 'Step 3: Circadian misalignment (later DLMO relative to wake time) exacerbates physiological
  sleepiness'
- 'Step 4: Increased slow eye movements measured by electrooculography indicate physiological
  sleepiness state'

  description: More slow eye movements were significantly associated with later DLMO
    (r = 0.375, p = 0.022), indicating that circadian phase moderates physiological
    sleepiness responses to sleep restriction
