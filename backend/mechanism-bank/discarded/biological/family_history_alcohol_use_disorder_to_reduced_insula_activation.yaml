direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heritable risk for AUD affects brain regions involved in interoception,
  emotion processing, and salience detection'
- 'Step 2: Family history-positive individuals show reduced activation in the left
  insula across both safe and threat conditions'
- 'Step 3: Diminished insula function may impair awareness of internal states and
  emotional processing regardless of environmental context'
- 'Step 4: This altered interoceptive processing may contribute to difficulty recognizing
  early warning signs of problematic alcohol use'
