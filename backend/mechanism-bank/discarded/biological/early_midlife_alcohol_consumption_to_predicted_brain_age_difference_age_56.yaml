direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol consumption at age 40 creates neurotoxic exposures affecting
  brain structure and function'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes direct neurotoxicity, oxidative stress,
  and disruption of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related metabolic and vascular changes accelerate brain tissue
  atrophy and white matter deterioration'
- 'Step 4: By age 56, accumulated structural brain damage manifests as advanced predicted
  brain age relative to chronological age'

  description: Within-twin-pair analyses suggested genetic mechanisms partially underlie
    the effects of alcohol (but not smoking) on predicted brain age difference, indicating
    heritable vulnerability factors moderate the alcohol-brain aging relationship
