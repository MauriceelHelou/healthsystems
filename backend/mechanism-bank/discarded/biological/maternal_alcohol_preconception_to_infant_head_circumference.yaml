direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption before pregnancy may affect oocyte quality
  and maternal physiological conditions'
- 'Step 2: Pre-conception alcohol exposure could potentially influence early embryonic
  development conditions'
- 'Step 3: However, no consistent pattern of association was found in this study,
  suggesting limited or no causal effect on head circumference development'
