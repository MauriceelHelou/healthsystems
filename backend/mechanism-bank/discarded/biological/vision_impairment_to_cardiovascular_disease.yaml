direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vision impairment creates structural barriers to physical activity, access
  to healthy food, and preventive healthcare engagement'
- 'Step 2: These barriers lead to higher prevalence of multiple CVD risk factors including
  obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, and excessive alcohol
  intake'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to vision-adapted healthcare interventions means risk factors
  are less effectively managed in people with VI'
- 'Step 4: Accumulation of poorly controlled risk factors increases cardiovascular
  disease incidence through biological pathways (atherosclerosis, hypertension, metabolic
  dysfunction)'

  description: The presence of multiple elevated risk factors (smoking aPR=1.40, physical
    inactivity aPR=1.14, excessive alcohol aPR=1.29, obesity aPR=1.28, hypertension
    aPR=1.29, high cholesterol aPR=1.21, diabetes aPR=1.54) creates synergistic effects
    that amplify CVD risk
