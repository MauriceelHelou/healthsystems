to_node:
  node_id: pro_inflammatory_cytokine_production
  node_name: Pro-inflammatory Cytokine Production
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure triggers immune system activation and T cell differentiation
  imbalance'
- 'Step 2: CD4+ T cells predominate over CD8+ T cells, favoring Th1, Th17, Tfh, and
  Tc subsets while reducing Treg cells'
- 'Step 3: Anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-2) decrease while pro-inflammatory
  cytokines are upregulated'
- 'Step 4: Increased synthesis of IL-2, IL-12, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, interferon-gamma
  (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)'
- 'Step 5: IFN-γ and TNF-α specifically trigger pyroptosis pathway through inflammasome
  activation'
