direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Positive family history indicates genetic predisposition affecting cardiovascular
  pathophysiology'
- 'Step 2: Inherited genetic variants promote unstable atherosclerotic plaque formation
  and thrombotic tendency'
- 'Step 3: Genetic influence on inflammatory responses and endothelial dysfunction
  increases plaque vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced plaque instability elevates risk of acute coronary events including
  ACS'
