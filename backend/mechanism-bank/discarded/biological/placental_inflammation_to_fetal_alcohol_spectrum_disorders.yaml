direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased Hofbauer cells and inflammatory gene expression create pro-inflammatory
  placental environment'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory cytokines and mediators cross placental barrier or alter placental
  function'
- 'Step 3: Fetal exposure to inflammatory signals disrupts normal neurodevelopment
  and organogenesis'
- 'Step 4: Inflammatory cascade contributes to spectrum of birth defects and neurodevelopmental
  disorders characteristic of FASD'
