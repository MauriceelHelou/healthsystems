direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: DMS facilitates increased binding affinity between NGF ligand and trkA
  receptor on peripheral nerve fibers'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced NGF-trkA complex formation triggers increased receptor phosphorylation'
- 'Step 3: Phosphorylated trkA activates downstream signaling cascades promoting neuronal
  growth'
- 'Step 4: Activated signaling pathways stimulate neurite extension and epidermal
  nerve fiber outgrowth'
