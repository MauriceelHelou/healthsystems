direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive hepatic encephalopathy stages represent worsening neuropsychiatric
  dysfunction and hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 2: Higher consumption of alcohol drives continued hepatocyte destruction and
  prevents liver regeneration'
- 'Step 3: Advanced HE stages are associated with severe metabolic derangements, cerebral
  edema, and multi-organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Increased progression through HE stages leads to rising mortality rates
  due to hepatic failure and neurological complications'
