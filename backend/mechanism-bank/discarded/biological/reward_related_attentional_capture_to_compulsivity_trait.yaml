direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Enhanced attentional bias toward reward-associated stimuli reflects altered
  reward processing'
- 'Step 2: Value-modulated attentional capture increases salience of rewarding stimuli
  including substances'
- 'Step 3: Heightened reward sensitivity contributes to repetitive habitual acts and
  compulsive symptomatology'
