direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated plasma triglyceride levels, even when only mildly elevated, create
  metabolic stress on pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Triglyceride accumulation and lipolysis release free fatty acids that are
  toxic to pancreatic acinar cells'
- 'Step 3: Free fatty acid-induced cellular injury triggers acute inflammatory cascades'
- 'Step 4: Severe inflammation results in acute pancreatitis, with risk present even
  at moderately elevated triglyceride levels'
