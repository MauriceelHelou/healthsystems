direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic inheritance and familial environment create neurobiological vulnerability
  in reward processing systems'
- 'Step 2: Young adults with family history of AUD show altered neural response patterns
  in the right nucleus accumbens during reward anticipation'
- 'Step 3: Family history-positive individuals demonstrate less differentiation between
  gaining $5 and losing $5 relative to gaining $0 in nucleus accumbens activation'
- 'Step 4: This blunted neural response to reward and threat cues may represent an
  early biomarker of AUD risk before problematic drinking develops'

    response (p > 0.70), suggesting threat may not be a contributing factor to risk
