direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated BAC impairs neurological function including reaction time, judgment,
  and motor coordination'
- 'Step 2: Impaired cognitive and physical function reduces ability to perceive hazards
  and respond appropriately'
- 'Step 3: Decreased hazard perception and response capacity increases probability
  of crash involvement'
- 'Step 4: Relative risk increases systematically with BAC level'

  description: Chronic alcohol users may show reduced impairment at given BAC levels,
    though still at elevated crash risk
