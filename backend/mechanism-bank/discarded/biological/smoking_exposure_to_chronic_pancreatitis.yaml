direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains toxic compounds that reach the pancreas through
  systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine and other tobacco toxins promote oxidative stress and inflammatory
  responses in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Smoking compounds the toxic effects of alcohol on pancreatic acinar cells'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative damage leads to chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and morphological
  changes characteristic of chronic pancreatitis'
