direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Untreated alcohol use disorder leads to progression of alcohol-related
  cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Advanced cirrhosis results in liver failure, portal hypertension, and associated
  complications'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol exposure in cirrhotic patients accelerates disease progression
  and decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate access to multidisciplinary treatment including behavioral and
  pharmacological interventions leads to alcohol relapse and increased mortality'
