  node_id: bacterial_infection_susceptibility

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Changes in gut microbial community structure alter the balance between
  commensal and pathogenic bacteria'
- 'Step 2: Disrupted microbiome reduces colonization resistance against opportunistic
  pathogens'
- 'Step 3: Loss of beneficial microbial functions (e.g., competitive exclusion, production
  of antimicrobial compounds) weakens defense'
- 'Step 4: Increased susceptibility manifests as higher infection rates and disease
  severity with conditional pathogens'
