direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Palmitoylethanolamide modulates altered nociceptive processing associated
  with central sensitization syndromes'
- 'Step 2: The combination reduces hyperalgesia and allodynia through anti-inflammatory
  and neuromodulatory effects'
- 'Step 3: Melatonin provides additional pain-relieving effects through antioxidant
  and sleep-enhancing properties'
- 'Step 4: Combined therapy reduces pain intensity as measured by VAS scores and tender
  point counts'
