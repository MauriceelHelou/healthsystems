direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption causes direct toxic effects on pancreatic
  acinar cells'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced cellular damage leads to abnormal activation and dysregulation
  of pancreatic lipase enzyme activity'
- 'Step 3: Altered pancreatic lipase activity contributes to pancreatic inflammation
  and autodigestion'
- 'Step 4: Progressive inflammatory cascade results in severe acute pancreatitis with
  high mortality risk'
