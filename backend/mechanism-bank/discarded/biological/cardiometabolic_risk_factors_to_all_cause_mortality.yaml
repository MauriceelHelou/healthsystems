- 'Step 1: Presence of cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension)
  creates systemic metabolic dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic dysfunction contributes to hepatic steatosis and progression
  of liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Combined burden of cardiometabolic conditions and liver disease increases
  overall mortality risk through cardiovascular events, liver-related complications,
  and metabolic sequelae'
