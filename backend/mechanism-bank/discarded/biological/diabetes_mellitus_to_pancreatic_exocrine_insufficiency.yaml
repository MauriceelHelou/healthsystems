- 'Step 1: Diabetes mellitus involves pancreatic dysfunction affecting both endocrine
  and exocrine components'
- 'Step 2: Chronic metabolic dysregulation and inflammation affect pancreatic acinar
  cells'
- 'Step 3: Progressive pancreatic insufficiency develops with reduced digestive enzyme
  production'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate enzyme secretion results in clinical pancreatic exocrine insufficiency'
