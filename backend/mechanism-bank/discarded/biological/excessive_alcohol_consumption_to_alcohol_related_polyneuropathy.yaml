direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption causes progressive accumulation of
  nerve damage over time'
- 'Step 2: Microstructural nerve alterations (elevated T2-relaxation time and proton
  spin density) progress from subclinical to clinically detectable levels'
- 'Step 3: Morphometric changes (increased nerve cross-sectional area) become pronounced
  enough to cause functional impairment'
- 'Step 4: Clinical polyneuropathy manifests with detectable electrophysiologic abnormalities
  and neurologic symptoms'
