direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-to-moderate alcohol consumption (1-4 drinks/week) during early pregnancy
  exposes the developing fetus to ethanol and its metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol crosses the placental barrier and interferes with cellular proliferation
  and migration during critical periods of craniofacial development'
- 'Step 3: Disruption of facial morphogenesis results in characteristic FAS facial
  features including smooth philtrum, thin vermilion border, and short palpebral fissures'
- 'Step 4: These facial features become measurable and identifiable by age 5 years
  through standardized photographic analysis'
