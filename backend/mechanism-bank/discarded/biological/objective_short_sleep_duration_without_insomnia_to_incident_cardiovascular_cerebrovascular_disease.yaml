direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Objectively measured short sleep duration (<6 hours on polysomnography)
  in normal sleepers reflects insufficient sleep time regardless of sleep complaints'
- 'Step 2: Chronic sleep restriction activates sympathetic nervous system and inflammatory
  pathways'
- 'Step 3: Sustained cardiovascular and metabolic stress accumulates over years of
  follow-up'
- 'Step 4: Increased physiological burden manifests as incident heart disease and/or
  stroke'
