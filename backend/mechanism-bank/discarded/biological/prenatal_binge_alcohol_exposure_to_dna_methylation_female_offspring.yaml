direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal binge-level alcohol consumption during pregnancy exposes the developing
  fetus to elevated blood alcohol concentrations'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and disrupts normal epigenetic programming
  during critical developmental windows'
- 'Step 3: Sex-specific epigenetic modifications occur, with female offspring showing
  differential DNA methylation patterns at specific gene loci'
- 'Step 4: These epigenetic changes alter gene expression patterns that persist at
  birth and may affect long-term development'

moderators:
- name: offspring_sex
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Evidence for DNA methylation changes was found specifically in female
    offspring but not in the overall sample, indicating sex-specific vulnerability
    to prenatal alcohol exposure
- name: tissue_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effects were tissue-specific, measured in both placental cells and
    buccal (cheek) cells, suggesting differential epigenetic responses across tissue
    types
- name: trimester_of_exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Drinking levels were measured across all trimesters, suggesting timing
    of exposure may moderate epigenetic effects
