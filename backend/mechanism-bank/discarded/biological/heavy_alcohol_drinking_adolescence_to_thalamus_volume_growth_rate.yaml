direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure during adolescent/young adult neurodevelopment
  when subcortical structures including thalamus are actively growing'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol neurotoxicity preferentially affects developing subcortical regions,
  particularly thalamus which shows age-dependent volume increases in controls'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol disrupts normal developmental processes specific to thalamic growth
  and maturation'
- 'Step 4: Attenuation of thalamic growth rate occurs while other subcortical structures
  (globus pallidus, brainstem, cerebellum) maintain normal developmental trajectories'
- 'Step 5: Region-specific growth impairment in thalamus may compromise functions
  including sensory processing, sleep regulation, and cognitive coordination'
