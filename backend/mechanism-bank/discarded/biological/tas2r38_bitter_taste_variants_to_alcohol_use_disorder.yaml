to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants in TAS2R38 gene alter bitter taste receptor function and
  perception of bitterness'
- 'Step 2: Modified bitter taste perception affects palatability and subjective experience
  of alcoholic beverages, which contain bitter compounds'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with reduced bitter taste sensitivity may find alcohol more
  palatable and consume greater quantities'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol consumption patterns combined with other genetic and
  environmental vulnerabilities lead to development of alcohol use disorder'
