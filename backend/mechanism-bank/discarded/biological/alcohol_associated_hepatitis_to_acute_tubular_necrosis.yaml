direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-associated hepatitis causes severe hepatic inflammation and dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Hepatic dysfunction leads to altered hemodynamics and increased circulating
  inflammatory mediators'
- 'Step 3: These systemic changes result in renal tubular damage and acute tubular
  necrosis'
- 'Step 4: ATN occurs more frequently compared to other AKI phenotypes in cirrhosis
  patients'
