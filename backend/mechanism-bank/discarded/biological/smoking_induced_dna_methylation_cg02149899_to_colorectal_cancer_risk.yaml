direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoking exposure induces aberrant methylation at CpG site cg02149899'
- 'Step 2: Altered methylation at this site disrupts normal gene regulation and cellular
  homeostasis'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulated gene expression creates pro-tumorigenic cellular environments
  in colorectal tissue'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated epigenetic alterations increase susceptibility to colorectal
  carcinogenesis'
