direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression symptoms trigger chronic activation of stress hormones and inflammatory
  pathways over decades'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress and inflammation contribute to endothelial dysfunction and
  reduced nitric oxide bioavailability'
- 'Step 3: Vascular health deteriorates progressively affecting penile blood flow'
- 'Step 4: Combined vascular and neurological changes result in erectile dysfunction
  diagnosis by late adulthood'
