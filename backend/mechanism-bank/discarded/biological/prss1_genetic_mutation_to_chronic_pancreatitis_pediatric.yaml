direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PRSS1 mutation alters pancreatic trypsinogen structure and function'
- 'Step 2: Mutated trypsinogen leads to premature or inappropriate activation of digestive
  enzymes within the pancreas'
- 'Step 3: Activated enzymes cause autodigestion of pancreatic tissue and inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Repeated inflammatory episodes lead to progressive fibrosis and chronic
  pancreatitis'
