direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis creates baseline pancreatic inflammation
  and architectural disruption'
- 'Step 2: Acute exacerbations on this chronic background lead to more severe inflammatory
  responses'
- 'Step 3: Severe inflammation progresses to pancreatic and extra-pancreatic necrosis
  in 49% of cases'
- 'Step 4: Necrotizing pancreatitis requires invasive interventions (11% needed percutaneous
  catheter drainage) and carries higher risk of organ failure'
