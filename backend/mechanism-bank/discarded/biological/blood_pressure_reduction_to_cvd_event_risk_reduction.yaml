direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) through lifestyle modifications
  including alcohol moderation decreases mechanical stress on arterial walls'
- 'Step 2: Lower blood pressure reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial
  oxygen demand, decreasing heart failure risk'
- 'Step 3: Decreased arterial pressure reduces endothelial injury and slows atherosclerotic
  plaque progression, lowering coronary heart disease risk'
- 'Step 4: Reduced vascular wall stress and improved cerebral perfusion regulation
  decrease stroke risk'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects result in 20-30% reduction in overall cardiovascular disease
  morbidity and mortality'
