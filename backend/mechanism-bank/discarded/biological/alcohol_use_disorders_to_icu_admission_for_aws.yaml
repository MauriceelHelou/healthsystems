  node_name: ICU Admission for Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to neuroadaptive changes including upregulation
  of excitatory neurotransmitter systems and downregulation of inhibitory GABA systems'
- 'Step 2: Abrupt cessation or reduction in alcohol intake causes unopposed excitatory
  neurotransmission'
- 'Step 3: Autonomic hyperactivity and CNS excitation manifest as alcohol withdrawal
  syndrome with potential for severe complications (seizures, delirium tremens, hemodynamic
  instability)'
- 'Step 4: Severity of withdrawal symptoms and risk of life-threatening complications
  necessitates ICU-level monitoring and treatment'
