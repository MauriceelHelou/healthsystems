direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children have greater numbers of naive and regulatory T cells compared
  to adults due to age-related immune system development'
- 'Step 2: These naive cells provide a broader immunological repertoire without pre-existing
  inflammatory priming'
- 'Step 3: Regulatory cells actively suppress excessive inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 4: This balanced immune profile prevents hyperinflammatory cytokine release
  during SARS-CoV-2 infection'
