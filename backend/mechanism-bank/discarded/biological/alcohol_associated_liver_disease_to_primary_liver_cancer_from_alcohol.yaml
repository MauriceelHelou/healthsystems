direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ALD-induced cirrhosis creates a pro-carcinogenic liver microenvironment
  with chronic inflammation and hepatocyte regeneration'
- 'Step 2: Repeated cycles of cell injury and regeneration in cirrhotic liver tissue
  lead to accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic changes'
- 'Step 3: Transformed hepatocytes develop into hepatocellular carcinoma in the context
  of ongoing alcohol exposure and cirrhotic architecture'

  description: Older adults show the steepest increase in liver cancer from alcohol
    (APC 2.93%), suggesting cumulative exposure time and age-related biological factors
    amplify cancer development from ALD
- name: us_versus_global_context

  strength: strong
  description: US trends show increases while global trends decline, suggesting structural
    and policy environments in the US create conditions that accelerate the ALD-to-cancer
    progression
