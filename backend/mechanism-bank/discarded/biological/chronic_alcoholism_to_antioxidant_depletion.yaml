to_node:
  node_id: antioxidant_depletion
  node_name: Antioxidant System Depletion
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure and metabolites (acetaldehyde) damage hepatocytes
  where detoxification occurs'
- 'Step 2: Hepatocyte damage impairs synthesis and activity of antioxidant enzymes
  (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase)'
- 'Step 3: Chronic endogenous intoxication exhausts body''s compensatory antioxidant
  capabilities'
- 'Step 4: Depleted antioxidant defenses persist through day 7 of intensive care despite
  therapy'
