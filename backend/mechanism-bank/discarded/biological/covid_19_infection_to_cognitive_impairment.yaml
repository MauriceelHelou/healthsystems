mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 infection causes persistent dysgeusia in vulnerable populations'
- 'Step 2: Taste disturbance leads to reduced nutritional intake and thiamine deficiency'
- 'Step 3: Thiamine deficiency produces Wernicke encephalopathy with neuronal damage'
- 'Step 4: Progression to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome results in persistent cognitive
  impairment and neurological disability requiring rehabilitation'
