direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts axonal development and myelination in
  the superior longitudinal fasciculus during fetal and early postnatal periods'
- 'Step 2: Altered white matter microstructure in SLF affects connectivity between
  frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted developmental trajectories in SLF impact language processing,
  memory, and executive function pathways'
- 'Step 4: These structural alterations contribute to cognitive, language, and social-emotional
  difficulties observed in children with PAE'
