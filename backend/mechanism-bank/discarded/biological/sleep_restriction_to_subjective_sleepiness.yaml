  node_id: subjective_sleepiness
  node_name: Subjective Sleepiness
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep opportunity restricted to 5 hours at home and 3 hours in laboratory
  creates sleep debt'
- 'Step 2: Sleep restriction interacts with circadian timing to produce sleepiness'
- 'Step 3: Later circadian phase (later DLMO) relative to wake time increases circadian
  misalignment'
- 'Step 4: Circadian misalignment leads to increased subjective sleepiness measured
  by Karolinska Sleepiness Scale'

  description: Greater subjective sleepiness was significantly associated with later
    DLMO (r = 0.510, p < 0.0001), indicating stronger effects for individuals waking
    at earlier circadian phases
