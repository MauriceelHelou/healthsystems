direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal consumption of Western-style diet during critical developmental
  periods affects fetal immune programming'
- 'Step 2: Dysregulation of innate immunity through changes in gut microbiota, metabolites,
  and epigenetic modifications'
- 'Step 3: Abnormal immune tolerance or trained immunity patterns established in offspring'
- 'Step 4: Early-life immune dysregulation has long-term consequences on neurodevelopmental
  pathways'
- 'Step 5: Behavioral disorders emerge in later life as result of immune-mediated
  developmental programming'
