direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure and liver disease disrupt immune system regulation
  and inflammatory homeostasis'
- 'Step 2: Neutrophils release excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in
  response to broad-spectrum infections and sterile triggers'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulated NET formation and inflammatory responses impair effective
  pathogen clearance'
- 'Step 4: Compromised immune function increases vulnerability to infections despite
  heightened inflammatory activation'
