direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Untreated or inadequately treated Wernicke''s encephalopathy causes permanent
  neuronal damage'
- 'Step 2: Chronic neurological dysfunction develops, particularly affecting memory
  and cognitive processing'
- 'Step 3: Persistent cognitive deficits emerge as the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff
  syndrome'
- 'Step 4: Long-term cognitive impairment results in dementia-like symptoms and functional
  disability'
