  node_id: ald_mortality_risk
  node_name: ALD Mortality Risk
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated PAD4 expression indicates increased neutrophil extracellular trap
  (NET) formation and severe inflammatory dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: High PAD4 levels correlate with greater liver dysfunction severity and
  development of ALD complications'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation marked by PAD4 contributes to multi-organ dysfunction
  and infection susceptibility'
- 'Step 4: Combined inflammatory burden and liver failure increase mortality risk
  in ALD patients'
