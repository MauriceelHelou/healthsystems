direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-existing health conditions create biological vulnerability through
  compromised organ function and metabolic capacity'
- 'Step 2: Chronic diseases reduce physiological reserve needed to metabolize and
  eliminate alcohol safely'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol consumption may interact with medications or exacerbate underlying
  disease processes'
- 'Step 4: Even low levels of alcohol consumption in the context of existing health
  conditions can precipitate acute events or accelerate disease progression'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative burden of health conditions and alcohol exposure exceeds compensatory
  capacity, increasing mortality risk'
