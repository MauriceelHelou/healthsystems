direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early pancreatic injury triggers recruitment of circulating monocytes to
  inflamed tissue'
- 'Step 2: Macrophages undergo classical M1 activation in response to proinflammatory
  signals (cytokines, DAMPs)'
- 'Step 3: Activated macrophages produce inflammatory mediators that amplify tissue
  damage and recruit additional immune cells'
- 'Step 4: Progressive accumulation of proinflammatory macrophage signals drives transition
  from acute to recurrent to chronic pancreatitis'
- 'Step 5: Sustained macrophage activation contributes to fibrosis and irreversible
  pancreatic damage in chronic disease'
