to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_administration_rate
  node_name: Rate of Alcohol Self-Administration
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predisposition from family history of alcoholism alters neurobiological
  sensitivity to alcohol''s rate of concentration change in the brain'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with higher FHD demonstrate different pharmacodynamic responses
  to the rate-dependent effects of alcohol'
- 'Step 3: These altered responses manifest as faster self-administration patterns,
  with shorter time to reach 80 mg/dl breath alcohol concentration'
- 'Step 4: The brain''s sensitivity to rate of change in alcohol concentration may
  represent a biological marker of risk for alcohol use disorder development'
