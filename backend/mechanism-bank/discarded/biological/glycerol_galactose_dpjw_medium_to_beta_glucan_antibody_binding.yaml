  node_id: beta_glucan_antibody_binding
  node_name: β-(1,3)-Glucan Antibody Binding Intensity
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Specific culture medium composition (glycerol/galactose with DPJW) modifies
  cell wall architecture and component distribution'
- 'Step 2: Modified cell wall structure results in increased surface exposure or accessibility
  of β-(1,3)-glucan epitopes'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced epitope accessibility allows stronger interaction with monoclonal
  antibodies specific to β-(1,3)-glucan'
- 'Step 4: Greater antibody binding suggests improved potential for immune system
  recognition and activation'
