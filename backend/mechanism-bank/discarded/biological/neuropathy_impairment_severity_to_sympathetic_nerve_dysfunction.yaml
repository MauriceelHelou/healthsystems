to_node:
  node_id: sympathetic_nerve_dysfunction
  node_name: Sympathetic Skin Response Amplitude Reduction
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive nerve fiber damage increases clinical impairment (weakness,
  sensory loss, reflex abnormalities)'
- 'Step 2: Autonomic nerve fibers are damaged concurrently with somatic nerve fibers'
- 'Step 3: Sympathetic dysfunction manifests as reduced or absent sympathetic skin
  responses'
- 'Step 4: Higher NIS scores correlate with lower sympathetic skin response amplitudes
  through shared nerve damage pathology'
