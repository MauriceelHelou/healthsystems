to_node:
  node_id: psychotic_disorder_schizophrenia
  node_name: Psychotic Disorder with Negative Symptoms
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oxidative phosphorylation deficiency acts as a trigger factor for psychotic
  events'
- 'Step 2: Mitochondrial dysfunction disrupts dopaminergic and other neurotransmitter
  systems'
- 'Step 3: Energy metabolism impairment in prefrontal and limbic circuits leads to
  psychotic symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Predominantly negative symptoms and further cognitive deterioration develop'
