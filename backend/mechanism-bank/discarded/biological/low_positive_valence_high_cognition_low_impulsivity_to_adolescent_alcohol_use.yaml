direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low reward responsivity in positive valence systems at ages 9-10 creates
  altered neural processing of reward stimuli'
- 'Step 2: High cognitive functioning combined with low impulsivity may not provide
  protective buffering when reward systems are dysregulated'
- 'Step 3: Altered reward processing patterns increase vulnerability to seeking external
  rewards through substance use'
- 'Step 4: By ages 11-12, these neural profiles predict increased likelihood of early
  alcohol experimentation and use'
