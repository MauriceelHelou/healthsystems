to_node:
  node_id: compulsive_alcohol_seeking_behavior
  node_name: Compulsive Alcohol-Seeking Behavior
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic liability for alcohol dependence creates neurobiological predisposition
  for heightened motivated responding to alcohol-related cues'
- 'Step 2: Genetically vulnerable individuals (modeled by alcohol-preferring P rats)
  demonstrate faster learning of discriminative stimuli that predict alcohol availability'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced discrimination learning and cue reactivity drives increased alcohol-seeking
  behaviors that persist even when alcohol is adulterated with aversive substances'
- 'Step 4: Neural systems governing seeking behavior operate independently from those
  controlling consumption, maintaining compulsive seeking despite reduced drinking'
