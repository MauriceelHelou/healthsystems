  node_id: wernicke_korsakoff_syndrome
  node_name: Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption severely disrupts thiamine (vitamin
  B1) absorption and metabolism'
- 'Step 2: Severe thiamine deficiency causes acute Wernicke''s encephalopathy with
  neurological damage'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate thiamine replacement, acute Wernicke''s encephalopathy
  progresses to chronic Korsakoff syndrome with permanent memory impairment'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related dementia may evolve into the more severe Wernicke-Korsakoff
  syndrome in some cases'
