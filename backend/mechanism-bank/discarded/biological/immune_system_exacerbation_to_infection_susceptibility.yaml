  node_name: Increased Infection Susceptibility
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic immune system exacerbation during obesity impairs normal immune
  regulation'
- 'Step 2: Dysregulated immune function reduces capacity to mount effective pathogen
  response'
- 'Step 3: Increased susceptibility to infections develops'
- 'Step 4: Higher risk of severe illness or death from infections occurs'
