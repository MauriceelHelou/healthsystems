direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Biofilm extracellular matrix creates physical barrier preventing immune
  cell contact with bacteria'
- 'Step 2: Biofilm structure inhibits recognition of bacterial antigens by host immune
  surveillance'
- 'Step 3: Protected microorganisms evade phagocytosis and antibody-mediated immune
  responses'
- 'Step 4: Chronic biofilm infections persist due to ineffective immune clearance'
