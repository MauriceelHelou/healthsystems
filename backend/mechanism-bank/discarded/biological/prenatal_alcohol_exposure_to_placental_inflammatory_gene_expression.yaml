mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol exposure during pregnancy induces oxidative stress and cellular
  damage in placental tissue'
- 'Step 2: Damaged cells release inflammatory signals and damage-associated molecular
  patterns'
- 'Step 3: Placental cells upregulate inflammatory response genes to address tissue
  stress'
- 'Step 4: Among 652 inflammatory genes examined, 35 showed differential expression
  with FDR p<0.05'
