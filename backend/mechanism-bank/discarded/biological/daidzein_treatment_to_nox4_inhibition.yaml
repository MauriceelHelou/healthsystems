to_node:
  node_id: nox4_inhibition
  node_name: NOX-4 Enzyme Inhibition
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Daidzein administration reduces NOX-4 overexpression in sciatic nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: Reduced NOX-4 activity decreases reactive oxygen species generation'
- 'Step 3: Enhancement of antioxidant enzyme levels further protects against oxidative
  damage'
