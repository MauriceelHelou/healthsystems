direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Some mothers abstain from alcohol completely during pregnancy but their
  children still present with FAS phenotypes'
- 'Step 2: Previous medical understanding exclusively attributed FAS to maternal drinking,
  creating diagnostic inconsistency'
- 'Step 3: Paternal preconception alcohol exposure represents alternative causal pathway
  through epigenetic transmission'
- 'Step 4: Recognition of paternal contribution explains previously unexplained FAS
  cases (e.g., 41 children diagnosed by CoFASP whose mothers denied alcohol use)'
