direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to nutritional deficiencies, particularly
  thiamine (vitamin B1) depletion'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency disrupts cellular metabolism and energy production
  in brain tissue'
- 'Step 3: Neuronal damage occurs particularly in mammillary bodies, thalamus, and
  cerebellum'
- 'Step 4: Acute Wernicke encephalopathy develops, which can progress to chronic Korsakoff
  syndrome with severe memory impairment'
