direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD has demonstrated heritability, transmitted through genetic and potentially
  epigenetic mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Genetic risk manifests as altered neurodevelopment in reward and interoceptive
  processing systems'
- 'Step 3: These neural alterations create differential vulnerability to substance
  use even before problematic drinking emerges'
- 'Step 4: Young adults with positive family histories represent an identifiable at-risk
  group for targeted prevention efforts'
