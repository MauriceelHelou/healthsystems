direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive ROS and oxidative stress cause direct damage to DNA, proteins,
  and lipids in developing fetal cells'
- 'Step 2: Oxidative damage disrupts gene expression patterns critical for normal
  neurodevelopment'
- 'Step 3: Lipid peroxidation impairs cell membrane integrity and cellular signaling
  in developing brain tissue'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated oxidative damage across multiple cellular systems contributes
  to the constellation of physical and neurological abnormalities in fetal alcohol
  syndrome'
