direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Endotoxin tolerance is appropriately induced following immune activation'
- 'Step 2: Tolerance creates a refractory immunosuppressive state in myeloid cells
  with reduced inflammatory capacity'
- 'Step 3: Reduced inflammatory activity prevents excessive tissue damage from prolonged
  inflammation'
- 'Step 4: The tolerant state promotes cellular repair mechanisms and tissue healing'
