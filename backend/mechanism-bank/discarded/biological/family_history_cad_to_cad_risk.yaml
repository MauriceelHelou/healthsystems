direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic inheritance from first-degree relatives transmits polymorphisms
  affecting cardiovascular health'
- 'Step 2: Inherited genetic factors influence cholesterol metabolism, blood pressure
  regulation, and inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 3: These biological processes accelerate coronary atherosclerosis formation
  and progression'
- 'Step 4: Increased atherosclerotic burden elevates risk of coronary artery disease
  manifestation'

  description: Early age of CAD onset in relatives significantly increases relative
    risk, suggesting stronger genetic contribution and earlier disease manifestation

  strength: moderate
  description: First-degree relatives show stronger correlation with CAD risk compared
    to more distant relatives, reflecting closer genetic similarity
