  node_id: neural_network_damage
  node_name: Neural Network Damage
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine deficiency compromises cellular energy production in neurons through
  impaired oxidative metabolism'
- 'Step 2: Energy-deprived neurons undergo oxidative stress and excitotoxicity'
- 'Step 3: Selective vulnerability of specific brain regions (mammillary bodies, thalamus,
  cerebellum) leads to structural damage'
- 'Step 4: Disruption of neural networks manifests as cognitive, motor, and psychiatric
  impairments'
