  node_id: alcohol_detection_latency
  node_name: Alcohol Detection Latency
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: New-generation wrist-worn transdermal sensors (Skyn) measure transdermal
  alcohol concentration (TAC) through skin contact at the wrist location'
- 'Step 2: Wrist placement provides faster transdermal alcohol detection compared
  to ankle placement, with Skyn TAC lagging BrAC by only 24 minutes on average'
- 'Step 3: Reduced detection latency (24 minutes vs 69 minutes for ankle monitors)
  enables more timely identification of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Faster detection allows for more immediate intervention opportunities to
  prevent alcohol-impaired driving and related traffic deaths'
