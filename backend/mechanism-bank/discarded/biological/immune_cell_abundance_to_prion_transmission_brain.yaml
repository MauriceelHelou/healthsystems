  node_id: prion_transmission_brain

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Specific immune cell populations in secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes
  and spleen) serve as sites for prion targeting'
- 'Step 2: Changes in abundance of these immune cells affect the efficiency of prion
  replication in lymphoid tissues'
- 'Step 3: Altered prion accumulation in secondary lymphoid organs modifies the rate
  of neuroinvasion'
- 'Step 4: Efficient transmission of prions from lymphoid organs to the brain determines
  disease susceptibility'
