direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy causes structural and functional damage
  to peripheral nerve fibers'
- 'Step 2: Damaged nerves develop abnormal electrical activity and altered pain signal
  transmission'
- 'Step 3: Chronic pain develops as a primary symptom of neuropathy, affecting quality
  of life and functional capacity'
- 'Step 4: Pain symptoms may become refractory to standard pharmacologic treatments,
  requiring alternative interventions'

  description: Access to neuromodulatory techniques (frequency rhythmic electrical
    modulated systems, dorsal root ganglion stimulation, spinal cord stimulation)
    may reduce chronic pain burden in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
    though access to these interventions is likely stratified by healthcare coverage
    and regional availability
