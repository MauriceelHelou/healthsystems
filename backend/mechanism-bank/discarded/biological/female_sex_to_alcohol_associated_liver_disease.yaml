mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young women display higher biological susceptibility to alcohol-related
  complications compared with male counterparts'
- 'Step 2: Differential metabolism and hormonal factors increase hepatotoxicity from
  alcohol exposure in females'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced vulnerability leads to accelerated progression of alcohol-associated
  cirrhosis and liver cancer at lower exposure levels'
