direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Steroid therapy is administered as first-line medical treatment for severe
  acute alcoholic hepatitis'
- 'Step 2: Non-response to steroids indicates more severe disease with uncontrolled
  hepatic inflammation and progression'
- 'Step 3: Patients without steroid response lack alternative effective medical treatments'
- 'Step 4: Progressive liver failure in steroid non-responders leads to significantly
  higher mortality without transplantation'
