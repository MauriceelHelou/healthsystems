direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: F10 diagnosis indicates more severe alcohol use disorder with psychiatric
  manifestations'
- 'Step 2: Severe alcohol use disorder associated with higher cumulative alcohol exposure
  and continued drinking'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol consumption accelerates liver injury, inflammation, and
  fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Psychiatric comorbidity may reduce treatment adherence and health-seeking
  behavior'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects result in poorer survival outcomes in ALD patients with
  F10 codes'
