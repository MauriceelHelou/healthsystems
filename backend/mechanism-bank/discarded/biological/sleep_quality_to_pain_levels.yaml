category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor sleep quality disrupts restorative physiological processes during
  sleep'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate sleep impairs central pain modulation and increases inflammatory
  markers'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulated pain processing systems lower pain thresholds'
- 'Step 4: Individuals experience elevated daily pain levels'
