mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to progressive alcohol-related liver
  disease'
- 'Step 2: Continued heavy alcohol use causes hepatocyte injury and inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Severe inflammatory response develops into alcohol-associated hepatitis'
- 'Step 4: Advanced disease manifests as acute hepatitis with high short-term mortality
  risk'
