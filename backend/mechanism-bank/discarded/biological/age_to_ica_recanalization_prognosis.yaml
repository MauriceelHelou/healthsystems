direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advanced age is associated with decreased vascular regenerative capacity
  and impaired endothelial repair mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Older patients have reduced physiological reserve and increased burden
  of comorbid conditions affecting procedural tolerance'
- 'Step 3: Age-related changes in vessel wall compliance and calcification increase
  technical difficulty of recanalization procedures'
- 'Step 4: Diminished neuroplasticity in older patients limits functional recovery
  potential after stroke-related injury'
