direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advanced age leads to immunosenescence - decline in immune cell numbers
  and immune organ structure'
- 'Step 2: Immunosenescence reduces immune defense capacity of the organism'
- 'Step 3: Reduced immune defense increases susceptibility to infections, particularly
  emerging and reemerging microorganisms'
- 'Step 4: Increased susceptibility translates to dramatically higher mortality rates
  from infectious diseases'
