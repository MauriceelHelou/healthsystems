direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD increases mortality through multiple pathways including liver disease
  progression, cardiovascular complications, and alcohol poisoning'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure in older adults compounds age-related physiological
  decline and comorbidity burden'
- 'Step 3: Increased prevalence of AUD translates to increased age-standardized mortality
  rates among older adults'
