direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Serum uric acid provides antioxidant protection specifically to peripheral
  nerve motor fibers'
- 'Step 2: Motor neurons in the tibial nerve are particularly vulnerable to oxidative
  stress damage'
- 'Step 3: Adequate uric acid levels protect motor nerve myelin and axonal structures
  from oxidative damage'
- 'Step 4: Preserved nerve integrity maintains faster motor conduction velocity in
  the tibial nerve'
