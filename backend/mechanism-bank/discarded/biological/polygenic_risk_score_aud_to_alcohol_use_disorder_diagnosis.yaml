direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Polygenic risk scores derived from European ancestry populations reflect
  genetic architecture specific to this population group'
- 'Step 2: Genetic variants affecting AUD risk operate through biological pathways
  including dopaminergic reward systems and alcohol metabolism'
- 'Step 3: In individuals with positive family history (FH+), PRS captures additional
  genetic risk beyond family environmental factors'
- 'Step 4: Independent association suggests genetic risk contributes to AUD even among
  those already exposed to familial environmental risk'
