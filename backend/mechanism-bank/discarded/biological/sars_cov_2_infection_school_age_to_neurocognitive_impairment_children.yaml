direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in children aged 6-11 years triggers neuroinflammatory
  processes and potential direct viral effects on developing neural tissue'
- 'Step 2: Persistent neurological changes disrupt cognitive processing, attention,
  memory, and executive function during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 3: Neurocognitive symptoms become prominent features of the PASC research
  index for this age group, distinguishing them from adolescent presentation patterns'
- 'Step 4: Impaired neurocognitive function contributes to decreased quality of life
  and overall health status, with potential impacts on educational attainment'

  description: Neurocognitive symptoms are emphasized in the PASC research index specifically
    for school-age children (6-11 years) but not as prominently in adolescents (12-17
    years), suggesting age-related vulnerability during critical neurodevelopmental
    periods

  strength: moderate
  description: School-age children showed 4 distinct PASC symptom phenotypes with
    neurocognitive features as key clustering components alongside pain and gastrointestinal
    symptoms
