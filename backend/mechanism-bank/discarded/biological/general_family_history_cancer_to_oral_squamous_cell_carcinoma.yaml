mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of cancer indicates potential inherited genetic susceptibility
  through germline mutations'
- 'Step 2: Genetic variants may affect DNA repair mechanisms, tumor suppressor genes,
  or oncogene regulation'
- 'Step 3: Inherited susceptibility interacts with environmental carcinogens to increase
  cancer risk'
- 'Step 4: Shared family environmental exposures and health behaviors may compound
  genetic risk'
