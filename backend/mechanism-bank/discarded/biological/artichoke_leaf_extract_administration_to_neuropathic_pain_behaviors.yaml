direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Artichoke leaf extract (800 mg/kg) administered for 21 days delivers antioxidant
  compounds to nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: Antioxidant activity decreases lipid peroxidation and restores SOD and
  GPx enzyme function in the sciatic nerve'
- 'Step 3: Reduced oxidative stress protects nerve tissue structure and function,
  reducing aberrant pain signaling'
- 'Step 4: Improved nerve function reduces thermal hyperalgesia (from day 14) and
  mechanical allodynia (from day 7)'

moderators:
- name: dose_threshold
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Only 800 mg/kg dose significantly reduced neuropathic pain behaviors;
    lower doses (200, 400 mg/kg) were ineffective, indicating a threshold effect
- name: pain_symptom_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Mechanical allodynia responded earlier (day 7) than thermal hyperalgesia
    and allodynia (day 14), suggesting differential sensitivity of pain modalities
    to antioxidant intervention
- name: treatment_timing
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effects became significant only after 7-14 days of treatment, suggesting
    cumulative antioxidant benefits over time
