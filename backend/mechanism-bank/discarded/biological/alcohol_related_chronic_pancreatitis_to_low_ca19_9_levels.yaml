direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis primarily causes inflammatory rather
  than malignant cellular changes'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory mass formation does not trigger the same oncogenic signaling
  pathways as malignancy'
- 'Step 3: CA 19-9 tumor marker remains low in inflammatory conditions compared to
  malignant transformation'
- 'Step 4: Patients with alcohol-related IMP demonstrate significantly lower CA 19-9
  levels compared to pancreatic carcinoma'
