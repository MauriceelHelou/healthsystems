  node_name: Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chemotherapy agents (particularly neurotoxic compounds) are administered
  as cancer treatment'
- 'Step 2: Neurotoxic chemotherapy drugs damage peripheral nerve fibers through mitochondrial
  dysfunction and axonal degeneration'
- 'Step 3: Nerve damage manifests as sensory and motor dysfunction in peripheral nervous
  system'
- 'Step 4: Peripheral neuropathy symptoms develop including numbness, tingling, pain,
  and functional impairment'
