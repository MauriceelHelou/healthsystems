direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic caffeinated soda intake during preadolescence disrupts normal neurodevelopmental
  processes'
- 'Step 2: Caffeine interferes with adenosine receptor function critical for synaptic
  plasticity and memory consolidation'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted neural development in hippocampal and prefrontal regions impairs
  working memory circuits'
- 'Step 4: Children exhibit lower working memory performance on cognitive assessments'
