  node_name: Korsakoff Syndrome (Disproportionate Memory Impairment)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency through
  malabsorption and poor nutritional intake'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency causes damage to specific brain structures including
  mammillary bodies and thalamic nuclei'
- 'Step 3: Structural brain damage results in severe and disproportionate impairment
  in memory formation and recall'
- 'Step 4: Memory deficits present as core feature of Korsakoff syndrome, distinguishable
  from other cognitive impairments'
