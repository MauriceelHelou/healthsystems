direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: β-carotene acts as an antioxidant compound when supplemented during ethanol
  exposure'
- 'Step 2: Antioxidant properties reduce oxidative stress induced by ethanol metabolism
  in pancreatic cells'
- 'Step 3: Protection of acinar cells, ductal epithelium, and stellate cells from
  alcohol-induced damage'
- 'Step 4: Improved cellular integrity leads to better pancreatic morphology and functional
  capacity'
