direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use disrupts normal sleep architecture, particularly REM
  sleep and sleep continuity'
- 'Step 2: Even after cessation, alcohol-related sleep disturbances can persist due
  to neuroadaptive changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic systems'
- 'Step 3: History of alcohol addiction may contribute to ongoing insomnia symptoms
  requiring targeted intervention'
- 'Step 4: Poor sleep quality may increase vulnerability to relapse and transfer of
  addiction to other substances or behaviors (e.g., binge eating)'
