direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inherited germline mutations in cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1/2, PALB2,
  Lynch syndrome genes, familial pancreatitis genes) are transmitted through families'
- 'Step 2: These genetic variants impair DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle regulation,
  or increase susceptibility to pancreatic inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Carriers have reduced capacity to repair spontaneous DNA damage or damage
  from environmental exposures'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic damage over time significantly increases lifetime risk
  of pancreatic malignancy'
