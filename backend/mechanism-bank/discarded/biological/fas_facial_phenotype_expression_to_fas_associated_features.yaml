direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure affects multiple developing organ systems simultaneously
  during embryonic and fetal development'
- 'Step 2: Severity of facial dysmorphology reflects the dose, timing, and duration
  of alcohol exposure and individual fetal vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Greater alcohol-induced teratogenic effects manifest across multiple systems
  including brain development, growth parameters, and craniofacial structures'
- 'Step 4: Correlation between facial phenotype severity and other diagnostic features
  reflects shared underlying pathophysiology of alcohol''s teratogenic effects'
