direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High alcohol intake causes direct toxic injury to pancreatic acinar cells'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to inflammatory changes and fibrosis in
  pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Progressive pancreatic damage reduces production and secretion of digestive
  enzymes'
- 'Step 4: Insufficient enzyme levels result in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency'
