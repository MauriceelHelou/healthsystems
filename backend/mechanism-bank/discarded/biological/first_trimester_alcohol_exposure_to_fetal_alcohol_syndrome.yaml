direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: First trimester represents period of organogenesis when major organ systems
  and craniofacial structures are forming'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure during this critical window disrupts cellular differentiation
  and migration patterns'
- 'Step 3: Teratogenic effects are particularly pronounced for facial development
  and neural tube formation occurring in weeks 3-8'
- 'Step 4: First trimester exposure, even if discontinued, can result in permanent
  structural abnormalities characteristic of FAS'

  description: Most drinking occurred in first trimester only (n=491), likely because
    many women discontinue upon pregnancy recognition. Earlier recognition enables
    earlier cessation, reducing exposure duration.
