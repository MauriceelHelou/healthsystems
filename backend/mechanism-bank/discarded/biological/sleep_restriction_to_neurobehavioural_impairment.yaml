direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep opportunity restricted to 5 hours at home and 3 hours in laboratory
  creates acute sleep deprivation'
- 'Step 2: Sleep restriction interacts with individual circadian rhythm phase timing'
- 'Step 3: Earlier wake times relative to circadian phase (later DLMO) produce circadian
  misalignment'
- 'Step 4: Circadian misalignment leads to increased attentional lapses on psychomotor
  vigilance task'

  description: Later DLMO (dim light melatonin onset) is associated with increased
    PVT lapses (r = -0.468, p < 0.01), indicating that individuals with later circadian
    phases experience greater neurobehavioural impairment following sleep restriction
- name: dlmo_to_sleep_onset_interval
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: When the difference between DLMO and sleep onset was less than 2 hours,
    individuals were significantly more likely to have at least three attentional
    lapses the following morning
