category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate or low levels of prenatal alcohol exposure occur during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Analysis controlled for multiple confounding factors affecting sleep'
- 'Step 3: No significant negative associations between moderate/low PAE and child
  sleep outcomes were detected'
- 'Step 4: Dose-response relationship suggests threshold effect where only heavy exposure
  produces measurable sleep problems'
