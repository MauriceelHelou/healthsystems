direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peripheral nerve injury (unilateral sciatic chronic constriction injury)
  initiates neuroinflammatory processes at multiple sites along the neuraxis'
- 'Step 2: Injury activates NLRP3 inflammasomes and consequent inflammatory cascades
  through TLR4 and P2X7 receptor signaling'
- 'Step 3: Neuroinflammation at the injured scionic nerve, dorsal root ganglia, spinal
  cord, and potentially higher levels creates sustained neuropathic pain'
- 'Step 4: Persistent neuropathic pain and inflammatory processes suppress active
  phase voluntary wheel running distance and speed throughout the 7-week observation
  period'
