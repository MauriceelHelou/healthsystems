to_node:
  node_id: neonatal_withdrawal_syndrome
  node_name: Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Drugs of abuse cross the placenta during pregnancy exposing the fetus to
  substances'
- 'Step 2: Chronic fetal exposure leads to physiological adaptation and physical dependence'
- 'Step 3: At birth, cessation of maternal drug supply triggers withdrawal in the
  newborn'
- 'Step 4: Withdrawal manifests as neonatal syndrome requiring pharmacological management
  to improve sleep, eating, and comfort'
