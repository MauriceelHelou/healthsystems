direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated serum IL-10 levels indicate activated anti-inflammatory pathways
  in response to diabetic nerve injury'
- 'Step 2: IL-10 elevation serves as a biomarker for extent of ongoing motor nerve
  damage in diabetic neuropathy'
- 'Step 3: Despite anti-inflammatory properties, elevated IL-10 correlates with more
  severe motor axonal injury'
- 'Step 4: Motor nerve axons demonstrate degeneration with reduced conduction parameters
  on electrodiagnostic testing'
