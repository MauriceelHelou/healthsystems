direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal age influences physiological factors including metabolic capacity,
  placental function, and overall pregnancy health'
- 'Step 2: Age-related changes in alcohol metabolism, oxidative stress responses,
  and cellular repair mechanisms may alter fetal vulnerability to alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Younger maternal age may correlate with less prenatal care access and health
  literacy, while advanced maternal age brings physiological vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 4: Age-dependent biological and social factors combine to modify risk of alcohol-related
  teratogenic effects'
