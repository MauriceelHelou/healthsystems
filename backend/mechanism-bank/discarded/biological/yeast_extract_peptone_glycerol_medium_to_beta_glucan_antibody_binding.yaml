  node_id: beta_glucan_antibody_binding
  node_name: β-(1,3)-Glucan Antibody Binding Intensity
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cultivation in yeast extract plus peptone with glycerol modifies cell wall
  composition and surface architecture'
- 'Step 2: This medium composition leads to increased production of masking molecules
  (potentially trehalose and glycogen)'
- 'Step 3: Surface molecules shield or hide β-(1,3)-glucan epitopes from antibody
  recognition'
- 'Step 4: Reduced epitope accessibility decreases antibody binding despite presence
  of β-(1,3)-glucan'
