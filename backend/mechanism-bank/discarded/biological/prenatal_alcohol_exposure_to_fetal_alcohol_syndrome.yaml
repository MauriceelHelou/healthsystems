  node_id: fetal_alcohol_syndrome
  node_name: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High levels or chronic maternal alcohol consumption during critical developmental
  periods exposes fetus to teratogenic effects'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in
  developing brain and craniofacial structures'
- 'Step 3: Severe teratogenic damage results in characteristic facial dysmorphology
  (smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures)'
- 'Step 4: Growth restriction and significant central nervous system impairment produce
  full clinical syndrome of FAS'
