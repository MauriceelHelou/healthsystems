direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorders represent a non-psychotic disorder (NPD) context
  examined alongside mood, anxiety, and drug use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol use disorders co-occur with attenuated psychotic symptoms creating
  a PE+NPD clinical state'
- 'Step 3: This combination state is associated with poor functioning and increased
  clinical service utilization'
- 'Step 4: The PE+NPD state represents the true ''clinical high risk'' phenotype rather
  than psychotic experiences alone'
