- 'Step 1: Absence of addiction treatment allows continued risky alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Ongoing alcohol exposure maintains chronic hepatic inflammation and injury
  in HCV-infected liver'
- 'Step 3: Uninterrupted fibrogenesis progresses from early to advanced stages'
- 'Step 4: Disease advances to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma without intervention
  on alcohol-related hepatotoxicity'

    (SVR p=0.319), it does not mitigate the ongoing hepatotoxic effects of continued
    alcohol consumption on liver disease progression
