mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children mount a rapid innate immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 2: Type I interferons are produced quickly at the site of infection'
- 'Step 3: Type I IFN inhibits viral replication in early stages of infection'
- 'Step 4: Early viral containment prevents progression to severe disease and systemic
  complications'
