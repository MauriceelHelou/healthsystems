direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive fibrosis destroys pancreatic acinar cells responsible for enzyme
  production'
- 'Step 2: Loss of pancreatic parenchyma reduces digestive enzyme secretion capacity'
- 'Step 3: Insufficient enzyme production leads to maldigestion and malabsorption'
- 'Step 4: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency develops with clinical manifestations'
