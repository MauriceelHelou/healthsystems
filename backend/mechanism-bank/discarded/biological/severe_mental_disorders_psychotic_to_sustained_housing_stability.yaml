direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychotic disorders and mood disorders with psychotic features involve
  cognitive impairments, perceptual disturbances, and difficulties with reality testing'
- 'Step 2: These symptoms may interfere with maintaining housing-related tasks (paying
  rent, communicating with landlords, maintaining unit) even when housing is provided'
- 'Step 3: Social isolation and stigma associated with psychotic symptoms may lead
  to conflict with neighbors or housing providers'
- 'Step 4: Standard Housing First support services may lack sufficient intensity or
  specialization to address complex needs of individuals with psychotic disorders,
  leading to lower rates of sustained housing'
