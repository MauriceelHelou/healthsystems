direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-associated hepatitis combined with hepatorenal syndrome represents
  the most severe form of hepatorenal interaction'
- 'Step 2: AH-driven hepatic inflammation exacerbates the functional renal failure
  characteristic of HRS'
- 'Step 3: The combination creates a synergistic effect on mortality risk beyond what
  MELD-Na captures'
- 'Step 4: AH independently predicts mortality in HRS patients even after adjusting
  for standard prognostic factors'

  description: The presence of hepatorenal syndrome specifically creates a context
    where AH becomes an independent predictor of mortality, suggesting synergistic
    pathophysiology between AH-driven inflammation and HRS-driven functional renal
    failure
