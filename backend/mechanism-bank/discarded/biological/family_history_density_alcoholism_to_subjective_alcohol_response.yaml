  node_id: subjective_alcohol_response
  node_name: Rate-Dependent Subjective Response to Alcohol (Intoxication and Stimulation)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic loading for alcohol dependence alters neurochemical systems involved
  in processing alcohol''s subjective effects'
- 'Step 2: These alterations specifically affect rate-dependent pharmacodynamic responses,
  including subjective intoxication and stimulation'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with higher family history density experience different patterns
  of subjective response as alcohol concentration changes'
- 'Step 4: These differential subjective responses may reinforce patterns of rapid
  alcohol consumption and contribute to risk for developing alcohol use disorder'
