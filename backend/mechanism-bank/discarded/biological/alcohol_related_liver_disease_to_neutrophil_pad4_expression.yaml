  node_id: neutrophil_pad4_expression
  node_name: Neutrophil PAD4 Expression
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related liver disease triggers inflammatory dysregulation and increased
  susceptibility to infections'
- 'Step 2: Neutrophils respond to sterile inflammatory triggers and infection risk
  by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)'
- 'Step 3: NET formation involves increased expression and release of peptidyl arginine
  deiminase type 4 (PAD4)'
- 'Step 4: PAD4 concentrations become significantly elevated in systemic circulation
  as a marker of NET release'

    more severe liver disease amplifies PAD4 expression

  strength: moderate
  description: PAD4 levels correlate with standard markers of inflammation, indicating
    broader inflammatory state enhances PAD4 release
