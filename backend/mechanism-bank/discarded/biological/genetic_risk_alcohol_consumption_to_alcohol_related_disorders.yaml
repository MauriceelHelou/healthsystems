to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_related_disorders
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Disorders
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants identified through GWAS influence individual susceptibility
  to alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 2: Polygenic risk scores aggregate multiple genetic variants to predict overall
  genetic liability for alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Higher genetic predisposition increases probability of developing clinical
  alcohol-related disorders beyond consumption levels alone'
- 'Step 4: Genetic architecture operates through multiple biological pathways including
  neurotransmitter systems and metabolic processes'
