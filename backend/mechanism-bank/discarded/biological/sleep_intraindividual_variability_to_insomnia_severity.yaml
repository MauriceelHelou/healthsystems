direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Irregular sleep-wake patterns disrupt circadian rhythm stability and homeostatic
  sleep drive regulation'
- 'Step 2: Inconsistent sleep timing creates maladaptive conditioning where sleep
  becomes unpredictable and anxiety-provoking'
- 'Step 3: Greater night-to-night variability perpetuates hyperarousal and cognitive
  distortions about sleep'
- 'Step 4: This cycle intensifies subjective perception of insomnia severity and sleep-related
  distress'
