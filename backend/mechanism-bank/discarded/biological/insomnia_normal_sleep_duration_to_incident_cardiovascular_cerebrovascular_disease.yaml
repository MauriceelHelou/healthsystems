direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insomnia complaints with objectively normal sleep duration (≥6 hours on
  polysomnography) represents sleep misperception or less severe biological disruption'
- 'Step 2: Despite subjective complaints, adequate objective sleep duration maintains
  physiological recovery processes'
- 'Step 3: Cardiovascular and metabolic systems experience less chronic stress compared
  to short sleep phenotypes'
- 'Step 4: Risk of incident cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease is not significantly
  elevated over follow-up period'
