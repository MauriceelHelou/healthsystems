direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Episodic future thinking intervention enhances cognitive engagement with
  potential negative consequences of heavy drinking'
- 'Step 2: Future-oriented thinking about academic goals increases awareness of risks
  associated with uncontrolled alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced risk awareness and future goal salience motivates adoption of
  harm reduction strategies'
- 'Step 4: Participants increase use of protective drinking strategies such as pacing,
  alternating drinks, or setting limits'
