direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption influences platelet activation and HDL-C metabolism,
  potentially affecting PHR levels'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-related changes in PHR contribute to inflammatory and metabolic
  dysregulation'
- 'Step 3: Metabolic and inflammatory pathways mediated by altered PHR increase vascular
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Vascular dysfunction and direct alcohol effects on blood pressure regulation
  increase hypertension risk'
