mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco consumption exposes oral mucosa to carcinogenic compounds including
  nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons'
- 'Step 2: Carcinogens cause DNA damage and mutations in oral epithelial cells'
- 'Step 3: Accumulation of genetic mutations leads to dysplasia and malignant transformation'
- 'Step 4: Progression to oral squamous cell carcinoma occurs'
