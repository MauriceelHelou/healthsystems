direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High night-to-night variability creates unpredictable sleep experiences
  that challenge expectations of sleep consistency'
- 'Step 2: Inconsistent sleep outcomes reinforce maladaptive cognitive patterns about
  sleep unreliability and uncontrollability'
- 'Step 3: Variable sleep performance strengthens catastrophic thinking about consequences
  of poor sleep'
- 'Step 4: Accumulation of unpredictable sleep experiences solidifies dysfunctional
  beliefs measured by DBAS-16'
