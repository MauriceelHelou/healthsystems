direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use leads to intoxication states that alter cognitive and emotional
  regulation'
- 'Step 2: Intoxication, along with withdrawal states, acquisition behaviors, and
  substance use lifestyle factors, create contexts associated with IPA'
- 'Step 3: These substance-related states interact with pre-existing pathway vulnerabilities
  (rule-breaking, entrenched use, or relationship insecurity)'
- 'Step 4: The combination increases both the frequency of IPA incidents and the severity
  of abuse perpetrated'
