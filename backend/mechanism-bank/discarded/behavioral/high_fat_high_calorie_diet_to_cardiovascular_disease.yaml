direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-fat and high-calorie dietary patterns act as modifiable cardiovascular
  risk factors'
- 'Step 2: These dietary patterns contribute to metabolic abnormalities including
  hypercholesterolemia and potentially diabetes'
- 'Step 3: Metabolic dysregulation leads to increased probability of cardiovascular
  events including myocardial infarction and stroke'
