mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy episodic alcohol consumption during adolescence exposes developing
  neural systems to neurotoxic effects'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure affects specific neuropsychological domains that are most
  sensitive during neurodevelopmental periods'
- 'Step 3: Impaired neuropsychological domain functioning results from disrupted neurodevelopment
  in adolescent brain regions'
- 'Step 4: The NCANDA 8-Factor Model demonstrates discriminant capacity for detecting
  these domain-specific impairments'
