- 'Step 1: Students employ protective strategies such as pacing drinking, alternating
  with water, or setting limits'
- 'Step 2: These strategies reduce peak blood alcohol concentration and overall alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower intoxication levels decrease risk exposure to harmful situations'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption and safer drinking contexts lead to fewer negative
  consequences'
