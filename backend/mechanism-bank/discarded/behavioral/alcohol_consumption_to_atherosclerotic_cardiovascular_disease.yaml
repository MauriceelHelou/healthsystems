direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption was included as a covariate in the analysis, suggesting
  it contributes to ASCVD risk'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol may contribute to cardiovascular risk through multiple pathways
  including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and direct myocardial toxicity'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol exposure can promote inflammatory processes and metabolic
  dysregulation'
- 'Step 4: These combined effects contribute to atherosclerotic disease development'
