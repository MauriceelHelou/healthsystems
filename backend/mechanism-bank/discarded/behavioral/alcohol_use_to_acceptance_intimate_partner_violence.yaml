direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use is socially patterned and normalized through broader cultural
  and economic systems that regulate substance availability and marketing'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption may be associated with social contexts and peer networks
  that normalize or minimize violence'
- 'Step 3: Individuals who use alcohol show significantly higher acceptance of male
  violence, potentially through reduced perception of harm or altered social norms'
- 'Step 4: Higher acceptance of violence creates permissive attitudes that fail to
  recognize intimate partner violence as harmful behavior'
