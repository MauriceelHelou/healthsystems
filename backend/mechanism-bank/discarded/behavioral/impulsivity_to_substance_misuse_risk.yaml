direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated impulsivity reflects poor executive function and behavioral inhibition
  deficits'
- 'Step 2: Impulsive children have difficulty resisting immediate rewards despite
  long-term consequences'
- 'Step 3: Reduced impulse control increases likelihood of experimenting with substances
  when opportunities arise'
- 'Step 4: Higher impulsivity scores predict escalation to progressively stronger
  psychotropic substances over time'
