mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol problems reduce cognitive capacity for conflict resolution and
  increase aggression potential'
- 'Step 2: Cyber monitoring creates continuous exposure to partner activities and
  potential jealousy triggers'
- 'Step 3: Information obtained through cyber monitoring acts as instigatory cues
  that provoke emotional arousal'
- 'Step 4: The combination of alcohol-impaired judgment and emotionally-charged information
  from monitoring escalates conflict to physical violence'
