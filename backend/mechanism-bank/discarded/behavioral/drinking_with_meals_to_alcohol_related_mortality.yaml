to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_related_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Mortality
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Consuming alcohol with food slows gastric emptying and reduces peak blood
  alcohol concentration'
- 'Step 2: Food intake provides nutrients and substrates that support alcohol metabolism
  and reduce oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Meal-centered drinking typically involves slower consumption rates and
  lower total alcohol volume per occasion'
- 'Step 4: Regular meal patterns with alcohol may reflect more stable social and economic
  circumstances that support health'
- 'Step 5: The combination of moderated absorption, nutritional support, and controlled
  drinking pace reduces physiological stress and mortality risk'
