direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural conditions (homelessness, social precariousness) limit access
  to hygiene resources, creating context for unhygienic injection practices'
- 'Step 2: Injection without proper hand-washing or site preparation allows bacteria
  from hands and skin to enter tissue during needle insertion'
- 'Step 3: Bacterial contamination at injection site triggers inflammatory response
  and infection'
- 'Step 4: Infection progresses to abscess formation and other soft tissue infections
  requiring medical treatment'
