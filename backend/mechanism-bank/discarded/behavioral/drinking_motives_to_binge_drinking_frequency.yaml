  node_name: Binge Drinking Frequency
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individual psychological motivations for drinking (coping, social, enhancement)
  develop in response to college social environment and stress'
- 'Step 2: These motivations drive initial patterns of alcohol consumption behavior
  in early college years'
- 'Step 3: Stronger drinking motives lead to increased frequency of binge drinking
  episodes'
- 'Step 4: Over time, the causal direction reverses as established drinking patterns
  begin to reinforce and shape subsequent drinking motivations'

  description: The causal effect of drinking motives on binge drinking is strongest
    in early college but reverses direction later, indicating developmental shift
    where established drinking patterns begin to drive motives rather than vice versa
