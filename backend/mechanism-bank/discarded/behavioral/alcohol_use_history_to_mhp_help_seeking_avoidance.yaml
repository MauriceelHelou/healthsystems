- 'Step 1: History of alcohol use among medical students in Thailand may reflect coping
  mechanisms for stress or indicate underlying mental health concerns'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol use carries social stigma in medical professional contexts and
  may compound fears of judgment from mental health professionals'
- 'Step 3: Students with alcohol use history may fear documentation of substance use
  in medical records and professional consequences'
- 'Step 4: These compounded stigma concerns create avoidance of formal mental health
  professional consultation'
