direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Even low frequency ENDS use involves periodic hand-to-mouth contact and
  device handling that creates exposure pathways'
- 'Step 2: Intermittent aerosol inhalation causes respiratory epithelial irritation
  and may reduce local immune function'
- 'Step 3: Social contexts of occasional vaping still involve proximity to other users
  and potential device sharing'
- 'Step 4: Even reduced exposure to vaping-related respiratory compromise increases
  SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility'
