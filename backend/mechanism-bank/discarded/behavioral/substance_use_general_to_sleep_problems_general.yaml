- 'Step 1: Substance use alters neurotransmitter systems involved in sleep-wake regulation
  (dopamine, GABA, serotonin)'
- 'Step 2: Chronic substance use disrupts homeostatic sleep drive and circadian rhythm
  synchronization'
- 'Step 3: Withdrawal states and substance craving interfere with sleep initiation
  and maintenance'
- 'Step 4: Interaction between psychotic disorder pathophysiology and substance-induced
  neurobiological changes exacerbates sleep dysregulation'
