  node_id: alcohol_consumption

to_node:
  node_id: colorectal_cancer
  node_name: Colorectal Cancer
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol and acetaldehyde directly contact colonic mucosa, causing DNA damage
  and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol alters gut microbiome composition, increasing production of carcinogenic
  metabolites'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol consumption increases colonic inflammation and disrupts
  intestinal barrier function'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol interferes with folate absorption and metabolism, impairing DNA
  synthesis and repair in rapidly dividing colonic cells'
