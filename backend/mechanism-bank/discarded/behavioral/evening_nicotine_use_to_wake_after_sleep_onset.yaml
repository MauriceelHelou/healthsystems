direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nicotine consumed within 4 hours of bedtime acts as a central nervous system
  stimulant with prolonged effects'
- 'Step 2: The stimulant properties of nicotine increase cortical arousal and disrupt
  sleep maintenance mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: This increased arousal leads to more frequent nighttime awakenings and/or
  longer periods of wakefulness during the sleep period'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative wakefulness after initial sleep onset increases measurably
  on that night'
