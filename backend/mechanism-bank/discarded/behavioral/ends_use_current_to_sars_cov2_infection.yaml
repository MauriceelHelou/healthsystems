  node_id: sars_cov2_infection
  node_name: SARS-CoV-2 Infection
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ENDS use involves repeated hand-to-mouth contact and touching of vaping
  devices, increasing potential exposure to contaminated surfaces and aerosols'
- 'Step 2: Inhalation of aerosols may compromise respiratory epithelial barrier function
  and immune response in the respiratory tract'
- 'Step 3: Social behaviors associated with ENDS use (device sharing, proximity to
  other users) may increase exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory droplets'
- 'Step 4: Compromised respiratory immunity combined with increased exposure pathways
  elevates susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection'
