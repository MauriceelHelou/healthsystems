direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Despite caffeine''s known stimulant properties, evening caffeine use within
  4 hours of bedtime did not show significant associations with sleep outcomes in
  this sample'
- 'Step 2: Possible explanations include caffeine tolerance among regular users, timing
  of consumption relative to individual metabolism rates, or lower doses consumed
  in the evening'
- 'Step 3: Individual variation in caffeine metabolism (influenced by genetic factors
  and habitual use) may buffer effects on sleep architecture'
- 'Step 4: The null finding suggests caffeine timing may be less critical than nicotine
  or alcohol timing for sleep disruption in this population'
