direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-installers face license suspension/revocation but continue to need
  transportation for employment, healthcare, and daily needs'
- 'Step 2: Lack of viable alternative transportation options forces continued driving
  without license or IID'
- 'Step 3: Fear of detection leads to ''driving cautiously'' behaviors to avoid law
  enforcement contact'
- 'Step 4: Unlicensed driving perpetuates traffic safety risks without technological
  monitoring or intervention'
