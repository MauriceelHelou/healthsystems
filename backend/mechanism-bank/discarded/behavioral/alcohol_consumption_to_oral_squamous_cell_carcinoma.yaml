  node_id: oral_squamous_cell_carcinoma
  node_name: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption leads to direct exposure of oral mucosa to ethanol
  and its metabolite acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde acts as a carcinogen causing DNA damage and disrupting DNA
  repair mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol increases permeability of oral mucosa to other carcinogens'
- 'Step 4: Chronic cellular damage and genetic alterations lead to malignant transformation
  and oral squamous cell carcinoma'
