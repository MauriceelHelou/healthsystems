direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hazardous alcohol consumption disrupts normal sleep architecture and circadian
  rhythm regulation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolites interfere with REM sleep and cause sleep fragmentation'
- 'Step 3: Repeated alcohol-induced sleep disruption reduces overall sleep quality
  in patients with psychotic disorders'
- 'Step 4: Psychotic disorders may amplify vulnerability to alcohol''s effects on
  sleep regulation'
