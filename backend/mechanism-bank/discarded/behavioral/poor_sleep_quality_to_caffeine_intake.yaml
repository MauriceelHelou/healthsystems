to_node:
  node_id: caffeine_intake
  node_name: Caffeine Intake
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor sleep quality results in daytime fatigue, slowed responses, and reduced
  alertness that impair functional capacity'
- 'Step 2: To compensate for fatigue and maintain work/social performance, individuals
  increase caffeine consumption'
- 'Step 3: Increased caffeine intake provides temporary alertness but may interfere
  with subsequent sleep initiation and quality'
- 'Step 4: This creates a bidirectional cycle where caffeine use perpetuates sleep
  disruption while being used to manage its consequences'
