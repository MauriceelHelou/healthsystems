direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder causes neurocognitive impairments affecting memory
  formation and recall'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure damages hippocampal structures critical for episodic
  memory consolidation'
- 'Step 3: Impaired memory processes reduce ability to accurately recall specific
  ED visit events over 12-month period'
- 'Step 4: Patients with alcohol use problems demonstrate both under-reporting and
  over-reporting of ED visits compared to objective health information exchange data'
