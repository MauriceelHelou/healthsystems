  node_id: chronic_pancreatitis_progression
  node_name: Progression to Chronic Pancreatitis
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Continued alcohol consumption after acute pancreatitis episode causes repeated
  pancreatic injury and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolites (acetaldehyde, fatty acid ethyl esters) directly damage
  pancreatic acinar cells and induce oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Recurrent injury triggers pancreatic stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis and atrophy lead to irreversible structural changes
  characteristic of chronic pancreatitis'
