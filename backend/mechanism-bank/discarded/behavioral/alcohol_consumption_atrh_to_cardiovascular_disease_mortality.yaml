direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Not consuming alcohol is identified as a healthy lifestyle factor for managing
  apparent treatment-resistant hypertension'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption can elevate blood pressure and interfere with antihypertensive
  medication effectiveness'
- 'Step 3: Among Black adults with aTRH, suboptimal adherence to alcohol abstinence
  (as evidenced by only 14.5% meeting 3 of 4 lifestyle factors and 1.2% meeting all
  4) contributes to poor blood pressure control'
- 'Step 4: Uncontrolled blood pressure in resistant hypertension population increases
  cardiovascular disease risk and mortality'
