to_node:
  node_id: youth_heavier_drinking
  node_name: Youth Heavier Drinking Patterns
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Positive attitudes toward alcohol increase intention to consume and lower
  perceived risks of alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Youth with favorable alcohol attitudes are more likely to initiate alcohol
  use at earlier ages'
- 'Step 3: Positive attitudes facilitate progression from experimental use to regular
  consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Heavier drinking patterns develop as attitudes normalize higher consumption
  levels'
