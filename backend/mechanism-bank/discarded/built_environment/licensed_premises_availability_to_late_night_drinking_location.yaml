mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensed premises provide commercial venues for alcohol consumption with
  extended operating hours'
- 'Step 2: While general drinking peaks similarly across settings around 8-9pm, licensed
  premises maintain service later into night'
- 'Step 3: Larger proportion of drinking occasions in licensed premises occur in later
  hours compared to home surroundings'
- 'Step 4: This shifts late-night drinking from private to public settings where assault
  risk is concentrated'
