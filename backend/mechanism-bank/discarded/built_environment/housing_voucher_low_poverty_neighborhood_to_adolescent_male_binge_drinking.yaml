direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing vouchers enable families to relocate from public housing to lower-poverty
  neighborhoods (tract poverty <10%)'
- 'Step 2: Relocation disrupts established social networks and peer relationships,
  with differential impacts by gender on adolescent boys'
- 'Step 3: Boys may face increased social stress, identity challenges, or need to
  establish status in new neighborhood contexts where different drinking norms or
  peer pressures exist'
- 'Step 4: Loss of familiar protective social structures in origin neighborhoods combined
  with challenges integrating into new neighborhoods increases vulnerability to binge
  drinking among male adolescents'

  description: The adverse effect of housing vouchers on binge drinking was specific
    to boys, with treatment-gender interaction P=0.002. Male adolescents showed 137%
    increase in binge drinking odds with housing voucher intervention, demonstrating
    strong gender modification of neighborhood mobility effects.
