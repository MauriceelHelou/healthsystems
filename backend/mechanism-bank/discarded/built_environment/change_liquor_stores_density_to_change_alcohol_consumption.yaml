mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increase in liquor store density over time expands the off-premise retail
  alcohol environment'
- 'Step 2: Expansion of retail outlets creates new purchase opportunities and reduces
  acquisition barriers'
- 'Step 3: New outlets may also increase price competition and promotional activities,
  further lowering barriers'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated reduction in barriers drives incremental increases in alcohol
  consumption over time'
