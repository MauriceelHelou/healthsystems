direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher outlet density increases local alcohol consumption and concentration
  of intoxicated individuals in specific geographic areas'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol intoxication reduces inhibition and impairs judgment, increasing
  likelihood of interpersonal conflict'
- 'Step 3: Outlets serve as congregation points that bring together individuals under
  conditions of impaired decision-making'
- 'Step 4: Clustering of outlets amplifies these effects by concentrating both alcohol
  availability and social interactions in high-density areas'

  description: The abstract specifically notes that clustering is 'particularly important
    when assessing the relationship between density and alcohol-related harms, such
    as violent crime,' indicating clustering amplifies the violence risk
