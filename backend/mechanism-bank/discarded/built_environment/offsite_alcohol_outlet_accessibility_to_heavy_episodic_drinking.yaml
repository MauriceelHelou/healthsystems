direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medium accessibility to offsite alcohol outlets (e.g., liquor stores, convenience
  stores) in British Columbia neighborhoods creates spatial arrangements that influence
  purchasing patterns'
- 'Step 2: Moderate spatial distribution may reflect regulated retail environments
  with controlled outlet placement that reduces convenience-based impulsive purchasing'
- 'Step 3: Reduced ease and convenience of alcohol access limits opportunities for
  heavy episodic drinking occasions among young adults'
- 'Step 4: Regulatory frameworks governing alcohol outlet placement create neighborhood-level
  protective factors against binge drinking behaviors'

  description: Provincial alcohol control policies and retail licensing systems create
    fundamentally different retail environments that moderate the relationship between
    outlet availability and binge drinking patterns. British Columbia's regulatory
    framework appears protective while Quebec's does not show the same effect.
- name: accessibility_level
  direction: u_shaped
  strength: moderate
  description: Medium accessibility (compared to low) showed protective effects, suggesting
    optimal spatial distribution of outlets may exist between very low and very high
    accessibility levels.
