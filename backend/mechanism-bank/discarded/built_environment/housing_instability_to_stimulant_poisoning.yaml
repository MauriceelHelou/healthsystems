direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates chronic stress and sleep deprivation that may
  increase stimulant use for functioning'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing environments increase exposure to polysubstance use and
  contaminated stimulant supplies'
- 'Step 3: Lack of stable housing disrupts access to mental health treatment that
  might reduce stimulant dependence'
- 'Step 4: Housing instability increases likelihood of using stimulants in unsafe
  quantities or contexts without medical monitoring'
