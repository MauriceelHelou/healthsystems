direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rapid increase in vehicle numbers creates higher traffic density on existing
  road infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Higher traffic density increases exposure risk and potential points of
  contact between vehicles'
- 'Step 3: Combined with inadequate enforcement, dense traffic creates more opportunities
  for crashes when drivers make errors'
- 'Step 4: Increased crash frequency leads to higher rates of traffic-related fatalities'
