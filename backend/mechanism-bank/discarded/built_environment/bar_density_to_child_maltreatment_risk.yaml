mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: In Mediterranean/South-European drinking culture, bars serve as social
  gathering spaces integrated into community life rather than primarily alcohol-focused
  venues'
- 'Step 2: Higher bar density in neighborhoods may indicate greater community social
  cohesion, informal social networks, and collective efficacy'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced social connections and community surveillance create protective
  factors that reduce family isolation and stress'
- 'Step 4: Increased social support and community monitoring reduce risk factors for
  child maltreatment'

    is integrated into social and family life, contrasting with Anglo-Saxon drinking
    patterns. This cultural context transforms bars from risk factors to potential
    protective community spaces.
