- 'Step 1: Ignition interlock devices are installed in vehicles to detect alcohol
  on driver''s breath'
- 'Step 2: Device prevents vehicle ignition when alcohol is detected above preset
  threshold'
- 'Step 3: Physical separation of alcohol consumption from vehicle operation eliminates
  opportunity for impaired driving'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in impaired driving incidents decreases alcohol-related crash
  occurrences and associated fatalities'
