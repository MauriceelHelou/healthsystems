direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different buffering methods (crow flies vs street network distances) capture
  different aspects of spatial exposure to alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 2: Crow flies method produces higher density estimates by including outlets
  that may not be easily accessible via actual walking routes'
- 'Step 3: Street network method provides more realistic measure of functional accessibility
  but may underestimate visual exposure and proximity effects'
- 'Step 4: Methodological choice affects exposure misclassification and subsequent
  epidemiological analyses of alcohol availability impacts'
