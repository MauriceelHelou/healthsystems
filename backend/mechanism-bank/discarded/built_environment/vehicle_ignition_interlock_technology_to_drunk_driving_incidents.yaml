mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multi-sensor IoT system (MQ-3 breath sensor, heartbeat sensor, facial recognition)
  continuously monitors driver''s alcohol level, physiological state, and alertness'
- 'Step 2: When alcohol level exceeds government-prescribed threshold AND either heartbeat
  is abnormal OR driver shows drowsiness, system automatically disables vehicle ignition'
- 'Step 3: System simultaneously sends alerts via Wi-Fi/TCP-IP to family, friends,
  or law enforcement to provide assistance'
- 'Step 4: Physical prevention of vehicle operation by intoxicated drivers reduces
  drunk driving incidents and associated mortality'
