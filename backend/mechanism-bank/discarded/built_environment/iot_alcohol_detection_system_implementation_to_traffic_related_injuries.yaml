- 'Step 1: IoT alcohol detection system prevents intoxicated individuals from operating
  vehicles by cutting off ignition'
- 'Step 2: Reduction in drunk driving incidents decreases likelihood of impaired driving
  accidents'
- 'Step 3: Fewer alcohol-related vehicle collisions result in reduced traffic-related
  injuries to drivers, passengers, and other road users'
