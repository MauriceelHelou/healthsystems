mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of on-premise licences (bars, restaurants) increases social
  drinking venues in neighborhood environment'
- 'Step 2: Greater density of drinking venues normalizes alcohol consumption as part
  of social and recreational activities'
- 'Step 3: Increased opportunities for social drinking create more frequent consumption
  occasions'
- 'Step 4: More frequent consumption occasions lead to higher overall alcohol intake'
