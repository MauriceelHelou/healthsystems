mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: System activates audible buzzer warning when drunk driving is detected'
- 'Step 2: Simultaneous automatic vehicle deceleration reduces speed of impaired driver''s
  vehicle'
- 'Step 3: Warning signals alert surrounding drivers to maintain safe distance from
  potentially impaired vehicle'
- 'Step 4: Reduced vehicle speed and increased awareness by surrounding traffic decreases
  collision probability and injury severity for bystanders'
