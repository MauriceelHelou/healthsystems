mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Autonomous (self-driving) vehicle technology removes or minimizes human
  driver role in vehicle operation'
- 'Step 2: Elimination of driver control removes the pathway through which alcohol
  impairment affects driving performance'
- 'Step 3: Vehicle navigation and safety decisions are transferred to automated systems
  unaffected by substance use'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related crash risk is fundamentally eliminated through technological
  replacement of human driving function'
