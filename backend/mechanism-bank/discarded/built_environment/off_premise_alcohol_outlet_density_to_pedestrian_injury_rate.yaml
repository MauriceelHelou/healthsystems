  node_id: pedestrian_injury_rate

direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores selling
  alcohol) concentrate in neighborhoods, often due to zoning and licensing policies
  that permit higher density in lower-income areas'
- 'Step 2: These outlets increase local alcohol availability and consumption in the
  immediate neighborhood environment'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol consumption leads to more intoxicated pedestrians and
  potentially impaired drivers in the area'
- 'Step 4: Intoxication impairs motor coordination, judgment, and reaction time, increasing
  collision risk and injury severity when pedestrians interact with vehicular traffic'

  description: The effect persisted even when controlling for convenience and corner
    stores, suggesting alcohol outlets contribute unique risk beyond general retail
