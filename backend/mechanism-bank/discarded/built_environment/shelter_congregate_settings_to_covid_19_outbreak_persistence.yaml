direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing policy results in congregate shelter and supportive housing as
  primary housing option for people experiencing homelessness'
- 'Step 2: Congregate settings create structural constraints including limited personal
  space, shared resources, and high-density living'
- 'Step 3: Standard outbreak control measures fail to address context-specific transmission
  routes such as drink sharing driven by resource scarcity'
- 'Step 4: COVID-19 spread continues at affected sites despite implementation of standard
  public health controls'
