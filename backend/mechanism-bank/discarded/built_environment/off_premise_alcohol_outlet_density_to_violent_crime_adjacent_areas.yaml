direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores) concentrate
  in specific geographic areas, creating spatial clustering of alcohol availability'
- 'Step 2: These outlets increase alcohol consumption and congregation patterns that
  extend beyond the immediate block group into adjacent neighborhoods'
- 'Step 3: Greater alcohol availability and consumption in surrounding areas increases
  intoxication-related conflict and violence spillover'
- 'Step 4: Violence manifests in adjacent block groups rather than solely in the block
  group containing the outlet, creating geographic redistribution of harm'
