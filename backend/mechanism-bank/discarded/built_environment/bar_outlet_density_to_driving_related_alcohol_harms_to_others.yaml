direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher bar density increases spatial clustering of alcohol establishments
  in communities'
- 'Step 2: Greater concentration of on-premise drinking locations increases local
  alcohol consumption and frequency of drinking occasions'
- 'Step 3: More bar patrons must travel from drinking locations to other destinations,
  increasing exposure to impaired driving'
- 'Step 4: Higher volume of alcohol-impaired drivers on roads increases risk of drink-driving
  incidents affecting passengers and other road users'
