mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bar settings normalize alcohol consumption and create environments where
  multiple individuals are intoxicated simultaneously'
- 'Step 2: Convivial drinking contexts reduce social monitoring and increase ambiguity
  around consent'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-rich environments provide opportunities for perpetrators to target
  intoxicated victims with reduced detection risk'
- 'Step 4: Impaired bystander capacity due to ambient intoxication reduces intervention
  likelihood, enabling sexual assault completion'

    likely amplifies risk by creating more contexts where intoxicated bystanders are
    present

  description: Prevention programs may be limited in addressing bystander intoxication,
    suggesting training alone cannot overcome structural barriers
