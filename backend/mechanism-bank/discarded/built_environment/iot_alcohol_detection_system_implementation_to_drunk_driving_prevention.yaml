mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IoT-based alcohol detection system uses sensors and microprocessor to continuously
  monitor driver''s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in real-time'
- 'Step 2: When system detects BAC levels indicating intoxication, it automatically
  cuts off vehicle ignition preventing vehicle operation'
- 'Step 3: Communication module sends real-time BAC data to remote server for monitoring
  and analysis, enabling intervention'
- 'Step 4: Physical barrier to drunk driving reduces instances of impaired vehicle
  operation'
