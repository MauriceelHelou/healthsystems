direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased density of all alcohol outlet types (on-premise, off-premise,
  combined) creates ubiquitous alcohol availability'
- 'Step 2: Multiple outlet types provide diverse purchasing contexts (bars, restaurants,
  bottle shops) increasing consumption opportunities'
- 'Step 3: Saturation of retail alcohol environment normalizes alcohol as routine
  commodity across social contexts'
- 'Step 4: Combined effect across outlet types increases overall population-level
  harmful consumption'
