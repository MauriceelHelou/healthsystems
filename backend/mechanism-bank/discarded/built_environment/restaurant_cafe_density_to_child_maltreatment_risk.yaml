- 'Step 1: Restaurants and cafes that serve alcohol provide additional points of alcohol
  access in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: These venues may contribute to overall neighborhood alcohol availability
  and consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: However, in Mediterranean culture, restaurants/cafes are primarily social
  and dining establishments rather than drinking-focused venues'
- 'Step 4: After controlling for neighborhood characteristics in Valencia, restaurant/cafe
  density showed no significant relationship with child maltreatment risk'

  description: In Mediterranean countries, restaurants and cafes function primarily
    as family dining and social spaces where alcohol is ancillary to food consumption,
    weakening any potential relationship to problematic drinking and child maltreatment.
