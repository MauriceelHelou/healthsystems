mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fuzzy logic-based alcohol detection system (FAADM) is installed in vehicles
  with sensors that detect alcohol in driver''s breath'
- 'Step 2: When alcohol is detected above threshold, the system prevents vehicle ignition
  and immobilizes the vehicle engine'
- 'Step 3: System includes rolling retests during operation to verify driver remains
  alert and sober throughout journey'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of intoxicated drivers from operating vehicles reduces drunk
  driving incidents on roads'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in drunk driving directly decreases traffic collision rates and
  associated fatalities'
