direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: System integrates three independent detection methods: breath alcohol sensor
  (MQ-3), heart rate monitoring, and facial recognition for drowsiness'
- 'Step 2: Multi-modal sensing reduces false positives by requiring alcohol detection
  PLUS either cardiac abnormality OR drowsiness before intervention'
- 'Step 3: Higher accuracy prevents inappropriate vehicle disabling while ensuring
  intervention when genuine impairment exists'
- 'Step 4: Improved detection accuracy increases system acceptability and effectiveness
  as a public health intervention'
