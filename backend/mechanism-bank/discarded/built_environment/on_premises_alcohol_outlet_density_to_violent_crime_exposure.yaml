direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of on-premises alcohol outlets concentrates alcohol availability
  in specific geographic areas'
- 'Step 2: Concentrated alcohol availability increases nighttime foot traffic and
  congregation of intoxicated individuals in public spaces'
- 'Step 3: Increased presence of intoxicated individuals in concentrated areas creates
  opportunities for interpersonal conflicts and aggression'
- 'Step 4: Geographic concentration of these interactions increases the spatial exposure
  to violent crime incidents in the neighborhood'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The effect appears strongest in areas with initially high density of
    alcohol outlets, as evidenced by the more dramatic impact in Buckhead which had
    high baseline density compared to areas with lower baseline density
- name: policy_intervention_timing
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Active regulatory efforts to reduce outlet density (as occurred in
    Buckhead 2003-2007) appear to strengthen the protective effect compared to passive
    density changes
