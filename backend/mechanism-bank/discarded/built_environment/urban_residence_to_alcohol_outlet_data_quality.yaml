mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban areas have more developed administrative infrastructure and centralized
  regulatory systems'
- 'Step 2: Higher population density justifies investment in sophisticated business
  licensing and tracking systems'
- 'Step 3: Greater density of outlets makes them more visible and easier to survey
  systematically'
- 'Step 4: Urban areas typically have stronger interagency coordination between local,
  state, and national databases'
- 'Step 5: Better data infrastructure enables more accurate documentation of alcohol
  outlets across multiple systems'

  description: The urban data quality advantage is strongest when combined with high
    income (>200% poverty), suggesting both urbanicity and economic resources contribute
