mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Built environment features including more non-profits, churches, and alcohol
  outlets combined with less agriculture and fewer vacant properties create a specific
  neighborhood physical context'
- 'Step 2: This built environment configuration shapes daily activity patterns, social
  interactions, and exposure to institutional and commercial influences'
- 'Step 3: The physical infrastructure determines opportunities for supervision, exposure
  to prosocial versus antisocial modeling, and accessibility of resources'
- 'Step 4: Children exposed to this built environment configuration develop conduct
  problems through cumulative environmental influences on behavior'
