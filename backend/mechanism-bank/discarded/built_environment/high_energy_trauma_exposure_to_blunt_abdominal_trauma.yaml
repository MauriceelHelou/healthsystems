direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-energy mechanisms including motor vehicle accidents (64.2%) and falls
  from height (26%) create biomechanical forces on the body'
- 'Step 2: These forces transmit energy to the abdominal cavity and internal organs'
- 'Step 3: Energy transfer can cause organ contusion, laceration, or rupture resulting
  in intra-abdominal injury'
