direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets increases physical availability and accessibility
  of alcohol products in the community'
- 'Step 2: Increased accessibility reduces travel time and effort required to obtain
  alcohol, lowering barriers to purchase'
- 'Step 3: Greater availability normalizes alcohol consumption through increased exposure
  to marketing and social cues'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects of accessibility and normalization lead to increased frequency
  and quantity of alcohol consumption'

  description: The abstract notes that clustering is 'an amplifier of certain alcohol-related
    harms,' suggesting that concentrated outlets in close proximity amplify the relationship
    between density and consumption
