direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-premise outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores) allow alcohol purchase
  for consumption elsewhere without on-site supervision'
- 'Step 2: Lack of effective measures to maintain order in and around off-premise
  outlets creates ungoverned spaces'
- 'Step 3: These outlets attract congregation and loitering without built-in social
  control mechanisms present in on-premise establishments'
- 'Step 4: Portable alcohol consumption disperses intoxicated individuals into public
  spaces with minimal guardianship, multiplying opportunities for violent encounters'
