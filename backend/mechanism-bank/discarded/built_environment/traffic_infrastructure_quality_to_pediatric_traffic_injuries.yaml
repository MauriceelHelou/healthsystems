mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Improved traffic infrastructure (e.g., pedestrian crossings, traffic signals,
  speed bumps, separated bike lanes) creates physical barriers and designated safe
  zones'
- 'Step 2: Infrastructure modifications reduce vehicle speeds and separate pedestrian/cyclist
  traffic from motor vehicles'
- 'Step 3: Reduced exposure to high-speed vehicle traffic decreases collision risk
  for children and adolescents'
- 'Step 4: Lower collision rates result in fewer physical injuries, fractures, and
  hospitalizations among pediatric populations'
