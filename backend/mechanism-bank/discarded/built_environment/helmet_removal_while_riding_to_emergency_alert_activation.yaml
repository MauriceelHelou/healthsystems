- 'Step 1: Touch sensor in smart helmet detects when helmet is removed while vehicle
  is in motion'
- 'Step 2: System automatically locks ignition to prevent continued riding without
  protection'
- 'Step 3: Cloud-based communication system sends automated alerts to designated emergency
  contacts and authorities'
- 'Step 4: GPS location data is transmitted to enable tracking and rapid response'
