direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic exposure to PM2.5 pollution damages cardiovascular, respiratory,
  and other organ systems over time'
- 'Step 2: Accumulated physiological damage increases risk of acute cardiovascular
  events (myocardial infarction, stroke) and chronic diseases'
- 'Step 3: Higher incidence of fatal cardiovascular and respiratory events leads to
  premature deaths before expected life expectancy'
- 'Step 4: Premature deaths result in years of life lost (YLLs) at the population
  level'
