direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher accessibility to offsite alcohol outlets in Quebec neighborhoods
  reflects a different provincial regulatory framework with potentially less restrictive
  retail policies'
- 'Step 2: Increased spatial availability of outlets where alcohol can be purchased
  for offsite consumption creates greater convenience and ease of access'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced convenience reduces barriers to alcohol procurement, enabling
  more frequent purchasing opportunities'
- 'Step 4: Greater ease of access facilitates heavy episodic drinking behaviors among
  young adults through increased alcohol availability in residential areas'

  description: Quebec's alcohol retail system differs from British Columbia's, potentially
    allowing greater outlet density or fewer restrictions on placement, which may
    strengthen the positive relationship between accessibility and consumption.

  description: Provincial cultural contexts around alcohol consumption may interact
    with retail availability to produce different patterns of use and heavy episodic
    drinking behaviors.
