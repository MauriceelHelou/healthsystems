mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NO2 exposure occurs disproportionately in communities affected by systemic
  racism due to historical residential segregation and proximity to traffic-heavy
  areas'
- 'Step 2: NO2 causes airway inflammation and oxidative stress in developing respiratory
  systems'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure leads to airway hyperresponsiveness and increased asthma
  incidence in children'
- 'Step 4: Racial disparities in NO2-attributable pediatric asthma have increased
  by 19% between 2010 and 2019 despite overall pollution reductions'
