mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: On-premise alcohol outlets (bars, restaurants) are licensed for alcohol
  consumption at the establishment'
- 'Step 2: Patrons consume alcohol at these locations before walking or driving in
  the surrounding area'
- 'Step 3: However, the effect was not statistically significant in multivariable
  models, suggesting different mechanisms or confounding factors compared to off-premise
  outlets'
