direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PM2.5 exposure occurs disproportionately in communities affected by systemic
  racism due to historical residential segregation and proximity to pollution sources'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 particles penetrate deep into lung tissue and enter the bloodstream'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular dysfunction
  result from chronic PM2.5 exposure'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and premature
  death'
- 'Step 5: Racial disparities in PM2.5-attributable premature mortality have increased
  by 16% between 2010 and 2019 despite overall pollution reductions'
