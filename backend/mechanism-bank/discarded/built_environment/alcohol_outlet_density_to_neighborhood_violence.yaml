direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets increases alcohol availability and accessibility
  in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Greater alcohol availability leads to increased alcohol consumption and
  congregation of intoxicated individuals in public spaces'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol intoxication impairs judgment and increases aggression, while congregation
  creates more opportunities for interpersonal conflict'
- 'Step 4: These conditions elevate the probability of assault events occurring in
  the neighborhood'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Areas with higher existing densities of alcohol outlets show stronger
    associations between additional outlets and increased violence. Sparse outlet
    areas show weaker or negligible effects.
- name: spatial_location
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Local spatial context and neighborhood characteristics modify the strength
    of the outlet-violence relationship, with certain locations identified as more
    likely to 'tip' into more violent conditions.
