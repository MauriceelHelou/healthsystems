mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) provides stable housing for chronically
  homeless individuals with substance use disorders (SUD)'
- 'Step 2: PSH reduces housing instability and removes survival-focused stressors
  that exacerbate substance use'
- 'Step 3: Access to on-site or coordinated services in PSH facilitates treatment
  engagement and recovery support'
- 'Step 4: Stable housing environment enables consistent access to healthcare, case
  management, and harm reduction services'

  description: Individuals with SUD were more likely to be placed in higher intensity
    service programs, which may improve outcomes through increased support

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Those with dual diagnosis (co-occurring SMI and SUD) were more likely
    to receive higher intensity services, potentially improving both mental health
    and substance use outcomes
