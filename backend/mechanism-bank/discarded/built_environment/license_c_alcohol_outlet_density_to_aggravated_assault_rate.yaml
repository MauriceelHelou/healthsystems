direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of combined on and off premises alcohol establishments increases
  alcohol availability and consumption in geographically concentrated areas'
- 'Step 2: Establishments become congregation points that increase population density
  and social interactions involving alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and increases aggressive behavior,
  while congregation points create more opportunities for interpersonal conflict'
- 'Step 4: These factors combine to increase the rate of aggravated assaults in areas
  with higher License C outlet density'

    affected, suggesting the relationship between alcohol outlets and assault may
    be stronger in geographically dense, poor, and socially isolated communities
