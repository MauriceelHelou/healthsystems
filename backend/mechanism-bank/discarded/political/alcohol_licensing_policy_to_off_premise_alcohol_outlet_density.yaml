direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Municipal zoning laws and liquor licensing policies determine where and
  how many alcohol outlets can operate in specific areas'
- 'Step 2: Historical discriminatory zoning practices and weaker enforcement in lower-income
  neighborhoods allow higher concentrations of off-premise outlets'
- 'Step 3: Economic pressures and lack of alternative retail development in disinvested
  areas further concentrate liquor stores'
- 'Step 4: Once established, outlets create economic and political constituencies
  that resist policy changes, perpetuating high-density areas'
