mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Outsourcing creates multilateral relationships between primary employers,
  subcontractors, and workers that fragment organizational responsibility'
- 'Step 2: Poor coordination between supervisors in the subcontract chain emerges
  due to diffused accountability structures'
- 'Step 3: Smaller size and private ownership of outsourcers lack resources and capacity
  for policy enforcement'
- 'Step 4: Management responsibilities become unclear and diluted across the subcontract
  chain, hampering policy implementation'
