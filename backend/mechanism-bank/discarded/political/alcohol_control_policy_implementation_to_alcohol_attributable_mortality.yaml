mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Russia implements multiple alcohol control measures including pricing policies,
  sales hour restrictions, advertisement bans, and controls on unrecorded alcohol'
- 'Step 2: These structural policies reduce population-level alcohol consumption and
  irregular heavy episodic drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Reduced heavy episodic drinking decreases acute cardiovascular events and
  chronic cardiovascular disease burden'
- 'Step 4: Population-level reductions in alcohol-attributable cardiovascular mortality
  and improvements in life expectancy'
