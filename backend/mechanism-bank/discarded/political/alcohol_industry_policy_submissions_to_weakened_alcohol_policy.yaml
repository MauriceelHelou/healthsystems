mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry actors submit policy recommendations to government consultations
  for national alcohol strategies'
- 'Step 2: Industry systematically manipulates, misuses, and ignores evidence to make
  assertions that oppose effective public health interventions (e.g., minimum unit
  pricing, advertising restrictions, population-level policies)'
- 'Step 3: Government policy makers may accept industry submissions at face value
  without adequate scrutiny of evidentiary practices'
- 'Step 4: Industry assertions undermine support for evidence-based alcohol policies,
  creating barriers to implementation of effective population-level interventions'
