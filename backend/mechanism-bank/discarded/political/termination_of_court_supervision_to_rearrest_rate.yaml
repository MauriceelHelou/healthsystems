direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court supervision termination (restoration to sanity) removes legal mandate
  for ongoing treatment participation'
- 'Step 2: Without court oversight, treatment disengagement becomes more likely due
  to reduced monitoring and accountability structures'
- 'Step 3: Treatment discontinuation leads to mental health symptom recurrence or
  destabilization'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or undertreated mental illness increases risk of behaviors leading
  to criminal justice contact'

  description: Those restored to sanity had previously been under conditional release,
    suggesting some protective benefit persists (25% rearrest) compared to those never
    supervised (43.8%), though substantially higher than those with ongoing supervision
    (8.2%)
