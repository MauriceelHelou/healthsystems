direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Warning labels frame alcohol consumption in terms of obesity risk by displaying
  caloric content equivalents in food images'
- 'Step 2: Obesity risk activates existing concerns and negative emotions about weight
  gain and body image'
- 'Step 3: This framing creates a salient, personally relevant deterrent that differs
  from traditional alcohol-specific health warnings'
- 'Step 4: Increased salience of obesity risk strengthens the deterrent effect on
  alcohol purchase and consumption intentions'
