direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus and state policies regulate whether firearms can be stored on campus
  or in proximity to student housing'
- 'Step 2: Restrictive policies increase physical and temporal barriers between students
  and firearms'
- 'Step 3: Greater distance and time required to access firearms reduces impulsive
  access during crisis moments or intoxication'
- 'Step 4: Reduced rapid access decreases risk of violence and self-harm particularly
  among students engaging in substance use'
