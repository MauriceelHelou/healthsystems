direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry asserts that targeted initiatives rather than population-level
  policies are needed to address alcohol harms'
- 'Step 2: This framing shifts focus from structural/environmental interventions to
  individual-level or high-risk group interventions'
- 'Step 3: Population-level policies that would reduce overall consumption and normalize
  lower-risk drinking patterns are not implemented'
- 'Step 4: Existing social gradients in alcohol harm are maintained or widened as
  structural determinants remain unaddressed'
