direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unlike other consumer products with health risks (tobacco, alcohol), gambling
  products lack standardized risk communication systems'
- 'Step 2: Absence of regulatory requirements for risk labeling creates information
  vacuum for consumers'
- 'Step 3: Consumers are unable to distinguish between low-risk and high-risk gambling
  products'
- 'Step 4: Poor risk assessment ability leads to uninformed product selection and
  exposure patterns'
