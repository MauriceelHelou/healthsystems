- 'Step 1: Same lobbyists and agencies concurrently represent alcohol, tobacco, and
  cannabis industries'
- 'Step 2: Shared representation facilitates coordination and information-sharing
  across industries with aligned interests'
- 'Step 3: Industries coordinate lobbying strategies when interests align, amplifying
  collective influence on policy'
- 'Step 4: Coordinated multi-industry pressure increases likelihood of pro-industry
  policy outcomes and weakens public health protections'
