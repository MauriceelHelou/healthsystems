mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Provincial governments enact alcohol control policies including licensing
  restrictions, zoning regulations, and outlet density limits'
- 'Step 2: These regulatory frameworks determine where, how many, and what types of
  alcohol outlets can operate in residential areas'
- 'Step 3: Restrictive policies reduce the spatial density and accessibility of both
  onsite and offsite alcohol outlets at the neighborhood level'
- 'Step 4: Controlled outlet availability creates built environment conditions that
  limit ease and convenience of alcohol access for residents'

    versus private licensing) fundamentally alter the intensity and nature of retail
    regulation, creating stronger or weaker restrictions on outlet availability.

  description: Local government authority to implement additional zoning restrictions
    on alcohol outlets can strengthen or weaken provincial-level regulations, creating
    within-province variation.
