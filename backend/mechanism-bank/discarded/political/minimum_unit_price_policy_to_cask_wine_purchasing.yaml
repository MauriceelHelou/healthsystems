direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit price policy sets floor price for alcohol per standard drink'
- 'Step 2: All cask wine purchases currently occur under $1.30 per standard drink,
  making them vulnerable to minimum pricing'
- 'Step 3: Pricing intervention would disproportionately affect cask wine relative
  to bottled wine'
- 'Step 4: Economic accessibility of cheapest alcohol format reduced, potentially
  decreasing high-volume consumption patterns'
