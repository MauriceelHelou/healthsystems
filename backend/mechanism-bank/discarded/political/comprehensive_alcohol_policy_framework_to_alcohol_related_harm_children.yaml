- 'Step 2: Price increases reduce household alcohol consumption particularly among
  heavy drinkers and those with limited resources'
- 'Step 3: Availability restrictions limit opportunities for impulsive alcohol purchases
  and excessive consumption'

  of alcohol-related violence and neglect'
- 'Step 5: Children experience fewer assault, maltreatment, and sentinel injury events'
