  node_id: enforcement_intensity
  node_name: Police Checkpoint Enforcement Intensity
to_node:
  node_id: drunk_driving_deterrence
  node_name: Drunk Driving Deterrence
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher enforcement intensity increases probability of detection for drunk
  drivers at checkpoint locations'
- 'Step 2: Increased detection probability raises expected costs of drunk driving
  behavior'
- 'Step 3: Higher expected costs create stronger deterrent effect through rational
  decision-making'
- 'Step 4: Deterrent effect is modulated by enforcement pattern predictability and
  learning dynamics'

- name: checkpoint_rotation_strategy
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Rotating checkpoints amplify intensity effects by preventing strategic
    avoidance, while fixed locations enable displacement that nullifies intensity
    benefits
- name: baseline_enforcement_level
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Intensity increases have larger marginal effects in contexts with low
    baseline enforcement where detection probability starts near zero
