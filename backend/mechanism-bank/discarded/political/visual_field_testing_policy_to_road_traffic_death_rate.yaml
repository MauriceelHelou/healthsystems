mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensing authorities mandate visual field testing to assess peripheral
  vision capacity'
- 'Step 2: Visual field assessments identify drivers with restricted peripheral vision
  who may miss hazards outside central gaze'
- 'Step 3: License restrictions for drivers with inadequate visual fields reduce on-road
  presence of drivers with compromised hazard detection'
- 'Step 4: Improved population-level hazard detection capacity theoretically reduces
  collision rates'
