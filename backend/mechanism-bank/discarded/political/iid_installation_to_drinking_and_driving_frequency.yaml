mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IID installation creates physical technological barrier that prevents vehicle
  ignition if alcohol is detected on breath'
- 'Step 2: Device removes possibility of impaired driving in interlock-equipped vehicle,
  regardless of offender''s intentions or judgment'
- 'Step 3: Real-time monitoring and data recording capability deters attempts to circumvent
  restrictions due to detection risk'
- 'Step 4: Mandatory compliance requirements and potential sanctions for violations
  reinforce behavioral modification during installation period'
