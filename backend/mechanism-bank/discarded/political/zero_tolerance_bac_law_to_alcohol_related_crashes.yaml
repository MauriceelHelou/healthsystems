mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zero tolerance law decreases legal blood alcohol concentration threshold'
- 'Step 2: Lower threshold increases enforcement opportunities and detection of impaired
  drivers'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced deterrence reduces alcohol-impaired driving prevalence'
- 'Step 4: Decreased overall frequency of alcohol-related crashes'
