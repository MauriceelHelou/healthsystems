direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry engages in direct lobbying through formal policy submissions
  to government agencies'
- 'Step 2: Industry submissions employ strategic framing (claims of regulatory redundancy,
  insufficient evidence, unintended consequences, legal barriers, and corporate social
  responsibility) to oppose evidence-based regulations'
- 'Step 3: These claims, though contrary to scientific evidence base, create political
  barriers and delay or prevent implementation of effective marketing restrictions'
- 'Step 4: Weakened or absent marketing regulations allow continued exposure to alcohol
  marketing that promotes harmful drinking'

  description: Industries facing less existing regulation (alcohol) emphasize different
    frames (regulatory redundancy, insufficient evidence) compared to more heavily
    regulated industries (tobacco, which emphasize legal/economic barriers)
