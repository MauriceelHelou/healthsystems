mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low and variable state drug testing rates (ranging from 10.0% to 70.8%
  depending on driver type) result in incomplete surveillance data'
- 'Step 2: Missing data is not random but systematically biased toward certain driver
  types (surviving, not-at-fault drivers tested less frequently)'
- 'Step 3: Biased testing creates systematic underestimation of drugged driving prevalence,
  particularly among certain driver populations'
- 'Step 4: Underestimated prevalence leads to inadequate policy responses and resource
  allocation for drugged driving prevention'

  description: Bias is most severe for surviving drivers not transported to hospital
    (14.0% tested) and not-at-fault drivers (10.0% tested), creating the greatest
    potential for underestimation in these populations

  strength: moderate
  description: States with fewer testing resources likely have more incomplete data,
    potentially correlating with other social and economic disadvantages
