direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Curfew policies restrict hours when individuals can be outside their homes,
  limiting opportunities for social interactions and public activities'
- 'Step 2: Reduced time in public spaces decreases exposure to high-risk environments
  and situations where violence and accidents occur'
- 'Step 3: Limited nighttime mobility constrains alcohol consumption opportunities
  in social settings and reduces late-night risky behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Decreased exposure to risk environments results in fewer unnatural deaths'
