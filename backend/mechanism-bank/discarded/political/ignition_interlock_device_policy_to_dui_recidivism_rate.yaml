direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IID policy mandates device installation for DUI offenders, creating continuous
  monitoring period'
- 'Step 2: Physical requirement to pass breath test before vehicle operation creates
  behavioral conditioning and consequences awareness'
- 'Step 3: Extended period of supervised driving with IID reduces opportunities for
  repeat DUI offenses during high-risk period'
- 'Step 4: Lower recidivism rates among IID-equipped offenders reduce overall population
  of repeat DUI offenders'
