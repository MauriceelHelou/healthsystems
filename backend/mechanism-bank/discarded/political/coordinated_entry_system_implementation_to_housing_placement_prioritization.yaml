mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HUD mandates implementation of coordinated entry systems (CES) in major
  metropolitan areas to standardize and prioritize PSH access'
- 'Step 2: CES creates systematic assessment and prioritization protocols to identify
  those with greatest housing need and service requirements'
- 'Step 3: Standardized entry processes aim to reduce arbitrary barriers and improve
  equity in housing placement for vulnerable populations including those with SMI,
  SUD, and dual diagnosis'
- 'Step 4: Policy creates infrastructure for matching individuals with appropriate
  housing intensity based on clinical and social needs'
