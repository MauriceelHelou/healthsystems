- 'Step 1: Legal driving access expands teenagers'' geographic mobility and independence
  from parental supervision'
- 'Step 2: Increased mobility enables access to drug markets, peer networks engaged
  in substance use, and unsupervised locations for drug consumption'

  use increases overdose risk'
- 'Step 4: Poisoning deaths from drug overdoses rise at the age threshold when driving
  becomes legally permitted'
