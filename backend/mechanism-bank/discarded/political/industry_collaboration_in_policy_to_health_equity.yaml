  fundamental conflicts of interest between profit motives and public health goals'
- 'Step 2: Industry collaboration leads to policy compromises that prioritize industry
  interests over evidence-based harm reduction measures'
- 'Step 3: Weakened policies fail to address structural determinants of alcohol harm,
  particularly in populations already experiencing health inequities'
- 'Step 4: Health inequities widen as vulnerable populations bear disproportionate
  burden of alcohol-related harms'
