- 'Step 1: Image-and-text health warning labels depicting disease consequences (e.g.,
  bowel cancer, heart disease) are applied to alcoholic drink packaging'
- 'Step 2: Visual exposure to graphic images showing health harms triggers affective
  processing and negative emotional responses'
- 'Step 3: Heightened negative emotional arousal increases salience of health risks
  associated with alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Particularly effective for labels depicting bowel cancer, which generated
  highest negative emotional arousal'
