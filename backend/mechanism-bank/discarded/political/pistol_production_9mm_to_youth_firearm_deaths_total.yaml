direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: 9mm pistol manufacturing increased 1298% from 2001-2020, dramatically expanding
  availability of this specific weapon type'
- 'Step 2: 9mm pistols are concealable, affordable, and widely distributed in communities,
  increasing youth exposure'
- 'Step 3: Higher magazine capacity and stopping power of 9mm ammunition increases
  lethality of violent encounters'
- 'Step 4: Weak regulation of specific caliber production allows market flooding with
  weapons particularly suited for interpersonal violence'
