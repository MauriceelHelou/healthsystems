mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State laws prohibit alcohol sales to visibly intoxicated customers, establishing
  legal liability for establishments and servers'
- 'Step 2: Prohibition policies create enforcement mechanisms through liquor control
  boards and potential penalties for violations'
- 'Step 3: When combined with RBS training, prohibition laws provide both legal framework
  and practical tools for refusing service'
- 'Step 4: Establishments in states with prohibition policies demonstrate lower rates
  of alcohol service to intoxicated patrons'
