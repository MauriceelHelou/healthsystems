category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: National maximum trading hour restrictions limit take-away alcohol outlets
  (shops, supermarkets) to between 7am and 11pm'
- 'Step 2: However, only 1% of alcohol shops and 9% of supermarkets were affected
  because most did not trade as long as their licensed hours permitted'
- 'Step 3: Minimal actual change in take-away alcohol availability during night-time
  hours due to very low proportion of affected outlets'
- 'Step 4: Insufficient reduction in take-away alcohol access to impact alcohol consumption
  patterns and related violence'
- 'Step 5: No measurable change in night-time assault calls attributable to take-away
  outlet restrictions'

  description: Only 1% of alcohol shops and 9% of supermarkets were actually affected
    by the restrictions. This extremely low proportion of affected outlets was insufficient
    to produce measurable changes in night-time violence.
