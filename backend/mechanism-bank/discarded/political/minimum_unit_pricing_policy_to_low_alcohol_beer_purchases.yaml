direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing increases the floor price of alcoholic beverages proportional
  to their alcohol content'
- 'Step 2: Higher-strength beers become relatively more expensive compared to lower-strength
  alternatives'
- 'Step 3: Price differential creates economic incentive for consumers to shift purchasing
  patterns'
- 'Step 4: Consumers substitute higher-strength beers with lower-strength beer products
  to maintain affordability'
