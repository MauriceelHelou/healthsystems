direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legalization of medical/recreational marijuana increases prevalence of
  marijuana use in population'
- 'Step 2: Increased marijuana use leads to greater likelihood of driving under the
  influence of marijuana'
- 'Step 3: Existing surveillance systems (EARS) lack capacity to capture biological
  sample types and toxicology results'
- 'Step 4: Absence of mandatory drug testing and reporting policies prevents effective
  monitoring of marijuana-involved crashes'
