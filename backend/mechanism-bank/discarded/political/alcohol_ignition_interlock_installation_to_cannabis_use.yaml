mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol ignition interlock devices are installed as a DUI intervention,
  physically preventing vehicle operation when alcohol is detected on the driver''s
  breath'
- 'Step 2: The interlock device creates a structural barrier to alcohol use before
  driving, leading to decreased alcohol consumption among some participants'
- 'Step 3: Among those who reduce alcohol use, substance substitution occurs as cannabis
  becomes an alternative psychoactive substance'
- 'Step 4: Cannabis use increases among the subgroup that decreased alcohol use, representing
  adaptation to the technology-based intervention'
