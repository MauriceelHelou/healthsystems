direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: WHO establishes recommended legal BAC limit of 0.05 g/dL for driving as
  a policy standard to address alcohol-related road harm'
- 'Step 2: Technology enables detection of alcohol intoxication at this critical threshold
  through real-time monitoring of physiological manifestations'
- 'Step 3: Enforcement of legal BAC limits through automated detection creates consequences
  for impaired driving at safety-critical thresholds'
- 'Step 4: Consistent enforcement of lower BAC thresholds reduces instances of drunk
  driving behavior'
