direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local licensing authorities actively review and deny applications for new
  alcohol premises licenses'
- 'Step 2: License denials prevent expansion of alcohol retail infrastructure and
  limit commercial availability'
- 'Step 3: Regulatory enforcement signals policy priorities and creates deterrent
  effects for potential applicants'
- 'Step 4: The number and types of alcohol outlets in the area remain stable or decrease
  rather than expanding'
- 'Step 5: Limited commercial availability reduces population-level alcohol access
  and consumption, decreasing health harms'
