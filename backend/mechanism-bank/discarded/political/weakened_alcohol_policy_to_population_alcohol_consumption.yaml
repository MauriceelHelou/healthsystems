direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry lobbying succeeds in excluding specific policy provisions (e.g.,
  pricing measures, advertising restrictions) or weakening their implementation through
  amendments'
- 'Step 2: Weakened policies create regulatory gaps that maintain easier alcohol availability,
  lower prices, and continued marketing exposure'
- 'Step 3: Population continues to face environmental conditions that promote alcohol
  consumption including widespread availability and marketing'
- 'Step 4: Overall population alcohol consumption remains elevated compared to what
  would occur under stronger policy measures'

    policy levers can still achieve population-level reductions in consumption

  description: Lower socioeconomic groups may be more sensitive to policy changes
    around pricing and availability, making weakened provisions particularly impactful
    for these populations
