direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: States with stronger alcohol policy environments implement comprehensive
  regulatory frameworks that constrain alcohol availability and marketing'
- 'Step 2: These structural constraints may differentially reduce male binge drinking
  rates which are typically higher at baseline'
- 'Step 3: Policies that reduce overall alcohol availability create ceiling effects
  that compress variation between demographic groups'
- 'Step 4: Gender disparities in binge drinking narrow as male rates decrease more
  substantially or female rates are prevented from increasing'
