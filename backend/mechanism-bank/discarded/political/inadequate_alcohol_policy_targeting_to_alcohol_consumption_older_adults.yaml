direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current alcohol policies in Norway do not specifically target or address
  older adult populations'
- 'Step 2: Absence of age-specific interventions creates regulatory gaps in monitoring
  and controlling alcohol consumption patterns in older adults'
- 'Step 3: Policy vacuum allows structural factors (marketing, availability, social
  norms) to operate without age-appropriate constraints'
- 'Step 4: Older adults experience increasing alcohol consumption without corresponding
  policy responses to mitigate public health consequences'
