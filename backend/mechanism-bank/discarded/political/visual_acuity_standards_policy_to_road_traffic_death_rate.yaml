mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensing authorities establish minimum visual acuity requirements (ranging
  from 6/6 to 6/18 in most jurisdictions)'
- 'Step 2: Visual acuity testing screens drivers for capacity to perceive critical
  visual details while driving'
- 'Step 3: Drivers with inadequate visual acuity are restricted from licensing or
  required to use corrective measures'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prevalence of drivers with poor distance vision theoretically decreases
  collision risk'
