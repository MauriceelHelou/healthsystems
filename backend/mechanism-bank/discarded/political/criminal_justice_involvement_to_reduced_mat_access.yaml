direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with opioid use disorder are criminalized and enter the justice
  system through drug-related charges'
- 'Step 2: Drug treatment courts impose structural requirements and supervision that
  may limit healthcare autonomy and treatment choice'
- 'Step 3: Court system policies and staff attitudes create barriers to MAT access,
  with less than half of opioid-involved participants accessing medications'
- 'Step 4: Justice involvement disrupts community-based healthcare relationships and
  creates additional obstacles to evidence-based addiction treatment'
