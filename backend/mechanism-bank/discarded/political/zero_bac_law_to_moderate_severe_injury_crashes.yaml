mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zero-BAC law eliminates legal threshold for alcohol consumption before
  driving'
- 'Step 2: Stricter legal standard theoretically reduces alcohol-impaired driving
  through deterrence'
- 'Step 3: Reduced drunk driving would decrease crash frequency and severity'
- 'Step 4: Fewer alcohol-related crashes would result in lower rates of moderate/severe
  injury crashes'

  description: Policy showed significant effects for fatal crashes but not for moderate/severe
    injury crashes, suggesting the mechanism may operate differently across severity
    levels. Fatal crashes may be more strongly associated with high BAC levels.
- name: time_since_implementation
  direction: u_shaped
  strength: weak
  description: Effect at 12 months was -10.2% and at 24 months was -9.4%, showing
    minimal change over time but remaining non-significant at both time points
