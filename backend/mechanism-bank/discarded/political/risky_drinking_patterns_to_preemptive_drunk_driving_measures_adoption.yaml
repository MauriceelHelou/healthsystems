direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Countries with risky drinking patterns have cultural and political normalization
  of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: This normalization reduces political will and public support for strict
  enforcement measures'
- 'Step 3: Policymakers face less pressure to implement comprehensive preemptive measures
  (random breath testing, BAC limits, sobriety checkpoints)'
- 'Step 4: Result is lower adoption and internal consistency of preemptive drunk-driving
  policies'
