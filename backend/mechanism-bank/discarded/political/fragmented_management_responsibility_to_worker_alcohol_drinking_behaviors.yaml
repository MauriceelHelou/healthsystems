- 'Step 1: Outsourcing dilutes and fragments management responsibility for worker
  health and safety across multiple entities'
- 'Step 2: Lack of consolidated accountability means no single entity takes ownership
  of alcohol policy enforcement'
- 'Step 3: Absent or weak enforcement creates permissive environments where workplace
  drinking is tolerated'
- 'Step 4: Workers receive inconsistent messages about alcohol policies, leading to
  increased drinking behaviors at or around work'
