mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower BAC limit establishes stricter legal threshold for impaired driving'
- 'Step 2: Drivers modify behavior to avoid legal consequences, reducing driving at
  BAC levels between 0.05% and 0.08%'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving decreases crash risk and severity'
- 'Step 4: Fewer and less severe crashes result in reduced fatalities'

- name: driver_compliance_behavior
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Wide difference between outcomes (4-16% vs 71-99% reductions) reflects
    sensitivity of BAC policy benefits to driver compliance. Greater compliance produces
    substantially larger reductions in fatalities.
- name: enforcement_infrastructure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effectiveness depends on enforcement capacity to detect and penalize
    violations at lower BAC thresholds
- name: driver_bac_distribution
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Scenario 3 assumed decreases limited to drivers near previous legal
    limit, producing smaller effects than scenarios assuming broader behavioral change
