direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis policy liberalization during 2000-2018 increased cannabis availability
  in contexts where alcohol was already widely available'
- 'Step 2: Concurrent availability of both substances facilitated polysubstance use
  patterns, particularly in social settings and among populations with access to both
  substances'
- 'Step 3: Increased co-use of cannabis and alcohol led to more drivers operating
  vehicles under combined impairment, resulting in higher co-involved fatality rates'
