mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry actors participate in government policy consultations
  and submit formal responses'
- 'Step 2: Industry actors systematically misuse scientific evidence (66% of submissions)
  and deny effectiveness of evidence-based strategies (91% of submissions)'
- 'Step 3: Industry submissions make unsubstantiated claims about adverse policy effects
  (76%) and promote alternatives without evidence (71%)'
- 'Step 4: Government decision-makers are exposed to industry-generated misinformation
  that obscures scientific consensus'
- 'Step 5: Policy adoption is delayed, weakened, or blocked due to manufactured controversy
  and perceived uncertainty about evidence-based interventions'
