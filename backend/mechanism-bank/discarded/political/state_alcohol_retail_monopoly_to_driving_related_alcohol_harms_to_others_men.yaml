direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State monopoly control restricts hours of alcohol sales and reduces total
  number of retail outlets compared to private markets'
- 'Step 2: Limited availability reduces convenience and accessibility of alcohol purchases,
  particularly for late-night drinking'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption and delayed drinking patterns decrease rates
  of impaired driving among male drinkers'
- 'Step 4: Fewer alcohol-impaired male drivers reduces risk to passengers, pedestrians,
  and other road users'
