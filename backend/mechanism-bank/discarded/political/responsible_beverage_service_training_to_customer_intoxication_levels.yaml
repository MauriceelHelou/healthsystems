mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandated responsible beverage service training provides standardized education
  on identifying intoxication and intervention techniques'
- 'Step 2: Trained servers gain knowledge and skills to consistently recognize signs
  of intoxication earlier'
- 'Step 3: Training legitimizes server role in encouraging responsible drinking and
  provides tools for effective intervention'
- 'Step 4: Servers more effectively limit alcohol service to intoxicated patrons through
  trained techniques'
- 'Step 5: Reduced alcohol consumption among highly intoxicated patrons decreases
  overall levels of intoxication attained by customers'
