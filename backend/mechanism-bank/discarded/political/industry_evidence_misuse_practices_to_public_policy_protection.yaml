direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry actors systematically deploy evidence misuse strategies including
  unsubstantiated claims (76% of submissions) and promotion of ineffective alternatives
  (71%)'
- 'Step 2: These practices create appearance of scientific controversy and undermine
  perceived policy effectiveness'
- 'Step 3: Policy makers face manufactured uncertainty and political pressure from
  industry stakeholders'
- 'Step 4: Democratic policy processes become vulnerable to capture by commercial
  interests rather than public health evidence'
- 'Step 5: Public health protection mechanisms are weakened, leaving populations exposed
  to preventable harms'
