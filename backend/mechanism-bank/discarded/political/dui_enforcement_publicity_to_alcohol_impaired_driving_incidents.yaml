mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public communication campaigns about DUI enforcement activities increase
  community awareness of enforcement presence beyond those directly stopped'
- 'Step 2: Heightened awareness amplifies the perceived risk of apprehension across
  the entire population, not just those who encounter checkpoints'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced general deterrence effect reduces impaired driving decisions at
  population scale, lowering overall incident rates'
