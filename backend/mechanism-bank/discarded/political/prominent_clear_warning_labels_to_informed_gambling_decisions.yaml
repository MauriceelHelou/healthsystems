- 'Step 1: Warning labels are designed as nudges with prominent placement, clear language,
  and explicit odds information'
- 'Step 2: Gamblers can easily access, read, and understand the probability of winning
  and risk of financial loss'
- 'Step 3: Clear information enables informed decision-making without restricting
  choice'
- 'Step 4: Individuals can assess whether the risk of losing money exceeds their acceptable
  threshold and make beneficial decisions (such as deciding risk is too high)'
