direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MLDA establishes age-based legal restrictions on alcohol purchase and possession'
- 'Step 2: Legal restrictions reduce opportunities for alcohol acquisition among underage
  youth through retail controls and enforcement'
- 'Step 3: Limited alcohol availability particularly constrains high-volume purchasing
  and consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Young men below the legal age experience substantial reductions in extreme
  drinking episodes'
