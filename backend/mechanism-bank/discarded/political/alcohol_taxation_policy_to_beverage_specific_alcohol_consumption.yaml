direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Taxation policy increases the price of specific alcoholic beverage types
  differentially (e.g., higher taxes on ready-to-drink beverages vs wine)'
- 'Step 2: Price increases reduce economic accessibility of highly-taxed beverage
  types, particularly for price-sensitive consumers'
- 'Step 3: Consumers, especially risky drinkers who are more price-sensitive, shift
  consumption patterns away from highly-taxed beverages toward lower-taxed alternatives'
- 'Step 4: Differential taxation creates country-specific beverage consumption profiles,
  with risky drinkers consuming proportionally more of the lower-taxed beverage types
  available in their jurisdiction'
