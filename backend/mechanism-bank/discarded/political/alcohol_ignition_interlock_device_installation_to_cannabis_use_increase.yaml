direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IID policy mandates installation for DUI-convicted drivers, creating physical
  barrier to alcohol-impaired driving by preventing vehicle start with BAC > 0.025%'
- 'Step 2: Device installation forces reduction in alcohol consumption among users
  who need to drive, as they cannot operate vehicle with detectable alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Drivers adapt to driving restriction by substituting cannabis for alcohol
  to maintain substance use patterns while complying with device requirements'
- 'Step 4: Cannabis use increases during IID installation period as drivers transfer
  substance use risk from alcohol to cannabis'

    significantly increased their cannabis use, indicating stronger substitution effect
    among those who reduced alcohol consumption
