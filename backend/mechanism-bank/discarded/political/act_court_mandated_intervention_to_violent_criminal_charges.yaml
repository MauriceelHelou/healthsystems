mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court-mandated ACT intervention provides experiential methods to foster
  psychological flexibility in convicted domestic violence offenders'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced psychological flexibility allows individuals to better regulate
  emotional responses and manage difficult internal experiences without avoidance'
- 'Step 3: Improved emotion regulation and reduced experiential avoidance decreases
  likelihood of engaging in violent behaviors beyond domestic contexts'
- 'Step 4: Reduced violent behavior translates to fewer violent criminal charges in
  the year following program completion'
