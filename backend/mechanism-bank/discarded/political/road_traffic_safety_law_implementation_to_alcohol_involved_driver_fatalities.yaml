- 'Step 1: New road traffic safety law with alcohol provisions implemented in 2010
  in Serbia'
- 'Step 2: Law intended to reduce driving under the influence through stricter regulations
  and enforcement'
- 'Step 3: However, inadequate enforcement mechanisms, penalties, or public awareness
  campaigns may have limited implementation effectiveness'
- 'Step 4: Absence of measurable changes in enforcement or driver behavior resulted
  in continued alcohol-impaired driving patterns'
- 'Step 5: Fatally injured drivers continued to have similar rates and levels of alcohol
  intoxication despite new legislation'
