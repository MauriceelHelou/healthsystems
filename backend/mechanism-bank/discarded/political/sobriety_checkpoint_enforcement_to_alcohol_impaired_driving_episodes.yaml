- 'Step 1: Publicized sobriety checkpoints increase perceived risk of detection and
  arrest among potential impaired drivers'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced deterrence through visible enforcement presence and public awareness
  campaigns shifts social norms around impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: Perceived certainty of punishment reduces likelihood of individuals choosing
  to drive after consuming alcohol above legal BAC limits'
- 'Step 4: Sustained enforcement operations create consistent environmental cues that
  reinforce behavioral change across population'
