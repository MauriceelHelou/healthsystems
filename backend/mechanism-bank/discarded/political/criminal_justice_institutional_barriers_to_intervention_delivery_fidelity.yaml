  node_name: Fidelity of Alcohol Brief Intervention Delivery
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic restrictions imposed significant operational constraints
  on prison facilities including limited access for external intervention staff and
  researchers'
- 'Step 2: Institutional policies prioritizing security and infection control reduced
  opportunities for intervention delivery according to planned protocols'
- 'Step 3: Significant deviations from initial study protocols occurred due to restricted
  access to prison resources and staff'
- 'Step 4: Intervention had to be delivered ''as implemented'' rather than ''as planned'',
  potentially reducing intervention fidelity and effectiveness'
