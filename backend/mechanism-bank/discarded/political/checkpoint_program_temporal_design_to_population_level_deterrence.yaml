mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policymakers and law enforcement design checkpoint programs with specific
  temporal configurations (frequency, spacing, timing)'
- 'Step 2: Strategic temporal placement of checkpoints within approximately 1-week
  intervals maintains sustained deterrent messaging in the community'
- 'Step 3: Consistent temporal pattern creates ongoing perceived risk of detection
  across entire driver population'
- 'Step 4: Population-level behavioral change occurs through general deterrence mechanism
  affecting all potential drivers, not just those stopped at checkpoints'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Sustained checkpoint programs with regular implementation over time
    likely strengthen deterrent effects. One-week duration of individual checkpoint
    effects suggests need for ongoing program maintenance.
- name: lagged_period_threshold
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effects observed specifically at 4-7 day lags and 1 week, but not at
    longer intervals, indicating critical temporal window for deterrence messaging.
