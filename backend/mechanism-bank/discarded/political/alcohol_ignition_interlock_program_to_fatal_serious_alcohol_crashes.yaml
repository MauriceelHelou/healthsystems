mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Interlock program prevents vehicle operation by participants when alcohol
  is detected, directly eliminating impaired driving events'
- 'Step 2: General deterrence effect reduces impaired driving across broader population
  through increased perception of consequences'
- 'Step 3: Combined specific and general deterrence effects decrease total number
  of impaired driving events across province'
- 'Step 4: Reduced impaired driving exposure leads to fewer opportunities for alcohol-related
  traffic crashes'
- 'Step 5: Decreased crash frequency results in reduction of fatal and serious injury
  events'
