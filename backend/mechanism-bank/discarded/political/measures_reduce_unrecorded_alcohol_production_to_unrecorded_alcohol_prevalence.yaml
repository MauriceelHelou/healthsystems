direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy measures targeting unrecorded alcohol production reduce illicit
  manufacturing capacity and cross-border smuggling'
- 'Step 2: Enforcement of regulations decreases availability of unrecorded alcohol
  in retail and informal markets'
- 'Step 3: Reduced structural availability limits population access to unrecorded
  alcohol sources'
- 'Step 4: Lower availability translates to decreased prevalence of unrecorded alcohol
  consumption at population level'
