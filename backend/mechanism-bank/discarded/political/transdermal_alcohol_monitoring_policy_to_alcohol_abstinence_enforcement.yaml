mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy requires DWI offenders to wear continuous transdermal alcohol monitoring
  devices that detect alcohol consumption through skin'
- 'Step 2: Passive monitoring provides 24/7 surveillance of alcohol consumption without
  requiring active participation from offender'
- 'Step 3: Real-time detection of alcohol consumption enables immediate identification
  of non-compliance'
- 'Step 4: Enforcement capability and deterrent effect promote sustained abstinence
  from alcohol'
