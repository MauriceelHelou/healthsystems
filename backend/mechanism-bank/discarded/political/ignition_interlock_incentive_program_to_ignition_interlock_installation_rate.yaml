direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Program creates financial and temporal incentives for early guilty plea
  and interlock installation'
- 'Step 2: Reduced suspension period and streamlined eligibility process lower barriers
  to installation'
- 'Step 3: Drivers respond to incentive structure by opting into interlock program
  at higher rates'
- 'Step 4: Installation rates increase as program makes interlock more accessible
  and attractive option'

    beyond the incentive structure itself, presenting opportunities for policy makers
    to influence uptake through additional mechanisms
