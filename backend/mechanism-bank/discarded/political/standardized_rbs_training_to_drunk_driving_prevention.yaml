mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized web-based RBS training increases consistency in server ability
  to identify and refuse service to intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 2: Higher refusal rates reduce the number of intoxicated individuals leaving
  alcohol-serving establishments'
- 'Step 3: Fewer intoxicated patrons exiting premises reduces the pool of potentially
  impaired drivers'
- 'Step 4: Reduced number of intoxicated drivers leads to decreased drunk driving
  incidents'
