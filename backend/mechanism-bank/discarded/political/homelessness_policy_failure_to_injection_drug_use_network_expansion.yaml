direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insufficient affordable housing stock and inadequate housing policies create
  homelessness among economically marginalized populations, including people who use
  drugs'
- 'Step 2: Homelessness concentrates individuals in specific geographic areas and
  eliminates private spaces, creating dense social networks among people who inject
  drugs'
- 'Step 3: These spatial and social conditions increase the likelihood that experienced
  injectors will encounter and assist individuals seeking to initiate injection drug
  use'
- 'Step 4: Assistance with injection initiation expands the network of people who
  inject drugs, perpetuating and amplifying injection-related harms across the community'
