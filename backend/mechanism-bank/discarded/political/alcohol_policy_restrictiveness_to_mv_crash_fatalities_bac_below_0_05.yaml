mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restrictive state alcohol policies reduce alcohol availability through
  multiple policy levers (taxation, outlet density, sales hours, marketing restrictions)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability lowers population prevalence of any alcohol
  consumption before driving, including very low-level consumption'
- 'Step 3: Decreased prevalence of driving with minimal alcohol impairment (BAC <0.05%)
  reduces crash risk even at these low concentrations where impairment effects are
  subtle'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of low-level alcohol-impaired driving translate to fewer motor
  vehicle crash fatalities at BAC <0.05%'
