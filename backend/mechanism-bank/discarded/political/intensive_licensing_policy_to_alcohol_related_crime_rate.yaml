mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intensive licensing policies reduce alcohol outlet density and modify the
  drinking environment through cumulative impact zones and license denials'
- 'Step 2: Fewer alcohol outlets and better regulated drinking environments reduce
  opportunities for alcohol-related antisocial behavior and violence'
- 'Step 3: Modified drinking environments may include improved management practices
  and reduced overcrowding in licensed premises'
- 'Step 4: Lower alcohol availability and improved environmental conditions reduce
  public intoxication and associated disorder'
- 'Step 5: Decreased alcohol-related antisocial behavior results in fewer alcohol-related
  crime incidents'
