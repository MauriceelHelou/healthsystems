direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universal interlock requirements for all DWI convictions create technological
  barrier preventing vehicle operation above BAC threshold'
- 'Step 2: Device requirement eliminates ability to drive while impaired regardless
  of individual decision-making, serving as physical deterrent'
- 'Step 3: Extended installation period creates sustained period of monitored driving
  behavior and accountability'
- 'Step 4: Reduced recidivism among convicted offenders decreases overall population-level
  alcohol-impaired driving episodes'
