- 'Step 1: Implementation of interlock program in 2008 creates heightened public awareness
  of impaired driving consequences and enforcement'
- 'Step 2: Media coverage and policy visibility increase general deterrence effect
  across entire driver population'
- 'Step 3: Perception of increased enforcement and consequences influences driver
  decision-making regarding impaired driving'
- 'Step 4: Reduced impaired driving behavior among broader population leads to fewer
  enforcement encounters'
- 'Step 5: Decreased impaired driving incidents result in temporary reduction in alcohol-related
  charges across province'
