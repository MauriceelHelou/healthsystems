mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Scientific papers and expert testimony use different BAC concentration
  units depending on country of origin'
- 'Step 2: Legal practitioners and courts may misinterpret BAC values when units are
  not properly converted or understood'
- 'Step 3: Misinterpretation can lead to wrongful convictions (overestimating BAC)
  or wrongful acquittals (underestimating BAC) in alcohol-related crime prosecutions'
- 'Step 4: Prosecution errors undermine the deterrent effect of drunk driving laws
  and affect traffic safety outcomes'
