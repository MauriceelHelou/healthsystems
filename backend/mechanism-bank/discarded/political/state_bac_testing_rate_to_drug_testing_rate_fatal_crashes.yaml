mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: States with higher BAC testing rates have established infrastructure and
  protocols for systematic substance testing in fatal crashes'
- 'Step 2: Testing infrastructure includes laboratory capacity, trained personnel,
  and standardized procedures that can be extended to drug testing'
- 'Step 3: States with robust BAC testing policies often implement parallel drug testing
  protocols, leveraging existing testing infrastructure'
- 'Step 4: Higher testing rates improve detection and documentation of substance-impaired
  driving across both alcohol and drugs'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Testing rates were highest among drivers who died at the scene (median=70.8%)
    compared to surviving drivers not transported to hospital (median=14.0%), indicating
    that testing protocols are more consistently applied to deceased drivers
- name: driver_fault_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Testing rates were higher among at-fault drivers who died (median=64.4%)
    compared to surviving drivers not at fault (median=10.0%), suggesting testing
    protocols prioritize suspected impaired drivers
