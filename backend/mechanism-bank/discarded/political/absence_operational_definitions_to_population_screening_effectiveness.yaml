direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Russian healthcare policy mandates alcohol risk assessment during dispanserization
  (population-based health screening) but provides no operational definitions for
  hazardous or harmful alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers must screen for ''risk of harmful alcohol use'' (ICD-10
  Z72.1) without clear thresholds or validated cut-off values'
- 'Step 3: Inconsistent screening criteria across providers and facilities leads to
  under-identification or mis-classification of alcohol problems'
- 'Step 4: Reduced effectiveness of population-level preventive interventions despite
  policy mandate for universal screening'
