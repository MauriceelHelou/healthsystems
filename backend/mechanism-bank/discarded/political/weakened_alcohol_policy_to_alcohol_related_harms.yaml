direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry political influence results in weaker alcohol control policies
  including reduced restrictions on availability, pricing, and marketing'
- 'Step 2: Weakened policies increase population exposure to alcohol through greater
  physical availability, affordability, and promotional activity'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure leads to higher rates of alcohol consumption across
  the population'
- 'Step 4: Elevated consumption results in greater burden of alcohol-related morbidity
  and mortality including chronic disease, injury, and social harms'
