mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current product labeling on supersized alcopops does not clearly identify
  the number of standard drinks contained per can'
- 'Step 2: Without clear labeling, consumers rely on visual cues from container size
  rather than actual alcohol content'
- 'Step 3: Young adults cannot accurately assess how many standard drinks they are
  consuming'
- 'Step 4: Systematic underestimation of BAC occurs, with magnitude increasing with
  quantity consumed'
