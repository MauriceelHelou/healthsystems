direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory ignition interlock laws require all convicted DWI offenders (including
  first-time offenders) to install devices that prevent vehicle operation if alcohol
  is detected'
- 'Step 2: Physical prevention mechanism blocks vehicle ignition when driver blood
  alcohol content exceeds preset limit'
- 'Step 3: Technology creates immediate structural barrier to repeat alcohol-impaired
  driving behavior'
- 'Step 4: Sustained installation period reduces recidivism among all offender categories
  including first-time offenders'
