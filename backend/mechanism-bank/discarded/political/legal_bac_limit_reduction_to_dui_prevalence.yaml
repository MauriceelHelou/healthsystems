direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stricter legal BAC limit (0.03 mg/mL) increases legal consequences and
  enforcement threshold for impaired driving'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced deterrence effect reduces willingness of drivers to consume alcohol
  before driving'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption patterns among drivers leads to reduced proportion
  meeting DUI criteria (BAC ≥0.005)'
- 'Step 4: Population-level reduction in alcohol-impaired driving behaviors among
  trauma patients'
