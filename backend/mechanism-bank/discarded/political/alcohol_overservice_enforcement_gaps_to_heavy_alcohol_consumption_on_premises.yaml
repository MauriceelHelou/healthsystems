direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Law enforcement agencies lack resource-efficient tools for enforcing overservice
  laws'
- 'Step 2: Overservice laws are seldom enforced due to resource constraints'
- 'Step 3: Bars and restaurants serve alcohol to visibly intoxicated patrons without
  consequences (90% service rate to obviously impaired patrons documented)'
- 'Step 4: Patrons continue drinking beyond legal intoxication limits in on-premises
  establishments'
