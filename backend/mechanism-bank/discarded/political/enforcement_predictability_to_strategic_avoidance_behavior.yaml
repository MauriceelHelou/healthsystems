direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Predictable enforcement patterns allow drivers time to learn spatial and
  temporal patterns'
- 'Step 2: Learning accumulates through repeated exposure, social information sharing,
  and observation'
- 'Step 3: Drivers use learned information to strategically modify routes and timing
  to avoid detection'
- 'Step 4: Avoidance behavior becomes widespread as information diffuses through social
  networks'
