direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy intervention implements regulations to reduce the number of on-premises
  alcohol outlets through licensing restrictions or non-renewal'
- 'Step 2: Reduced outlet density decreases geographic concentration of alcohol availability
  and associated nighttime commerce'
- 'Step 3: Decreased concentration reduces the spatial clustering of alcohol consumption
  and intoxicated individuals in public areas'
- 'Step 4: Lower concentration of alcohol-related activity reduces opportunities and
  settings for violent interpersonal conflicts'

  description: Even a modest 3% reduction in outlet density produced substantial crime
    reduction, suggesting that larger reductions could have even greater protective
    effects
- name: initial_outlet_density
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Policies implemented in neighborhoods with high initial outlet density
    may show greater absolute reductions in violent crime exposure compared to areas
    with lower baseline density
