direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy and enforcement changes from 1990 to early 2000s shifted focus to
  less intoxicated offenders'
- 'Step 2: Female-typical offending patterns involve lower blood alcohol concentrations
  compared to male patterns'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced surveillance and enforcement at lower BAC thresholds made previously
  undetected female DUI more visible to law enforcement'
- 'Step 4: Increased detection and arrest of female-typical DUI patterns narrowed
  the gender gap in DUI arrests despite potentially stable underlying behavior'

    the narrowing is primarily due to differential decline rates rather than enforcement

  description: Women's lower typical BAC levels made them more likely to be detected
    under expanded enforcement targeting less intoxicated offenders
