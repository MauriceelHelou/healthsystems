  node_name: Policy Capture by Industry Interests
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government lacks policies requiring transparency and disclosure of interactions
  with alcohol industry representatives'
- 'Step 2: Industry influence operates through opaque channels including undisclosed
  meetings, political donations, and lobbying activities'
- 'Step 3: Without public scrutiny, industry priorities become embedded in policy
  processes and outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Resulting policies reflect industry interests rather than public health
  evidence, leading to regulatory capture that perpetuates alcohol-related harms'
