direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry self-regulatory codes are designed with commercial interests influencing
  definitions and enforcement, creating inherent conflicts of interest'
- 'Step 2: Inconsistent definitions and limited scope in industry codes mean many
  ZAPs fall outside regulatory coverage, particularly products under 0.5% alcohol
  by volume'
- 'Step 3: Weak enforcement mechanisms and lack of government oversight allow industry
  to market ZAPs without meaningful restrictions on youth exposure'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate protection enables continued youth exposure to alcohol-related
  marketing through ZAP channels'
