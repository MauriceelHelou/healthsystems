mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Risk industries (tobacco, alcohol, gambling, sugar) establish SAPROs to
  perform indirect lobbying functions while appearing as independent organizations'
- 'Step 2: SAPROs operate within neoliberal policy frameworks to communicate ''risk''
  and ''responsibility'' messages that prioritize industry profits over public health'
- 'Step 3: SAPROs hegemonically promote personal responsibility ideology, shifting
  focus from structural/policy interventions to individual behavior'
- 'Step 4: This indirect lobbying forestalls regulatory measures that would reduce
  industry harms, preventing implementation of population-level health protections'
