direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current excise tax levels on alcohol sales in India (1.8 trillion INR nationally)
  are insufficient relative to health costs, creating low price disincentives for
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Low taxation maintains alcohol affordability and availability, facilitating
  higher population-level alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: Higher alcohol consumption increases exposure to alcohol as a risk factor
  across multiple disease pathways (as measured through GBD 2019 Study methodology)'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol exposure generates substantial disease burden measured
  in disability-adjusted life-years (6.2 trillion INR societal value of health lost)'
- 'Step 5: Net societal loss of 4.4 trillion INR represents the excess health burden
  not offset by revenue, indicating inadequate tax policy to disincentivize consumption'
