mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of immediate roadside suspension for previously untargeted
  BAC range (0.05-0.08%) creates new legal consequences for moderate alcohol consumption
  before driving'
- 'Step 2: Expansion of sanctions to warn-range BAC increases perceived risk of legal
  penalties among drivers who previously operated vehicles in this BAC range without
  consequences'
- 'Step 3: General deterrence effect reduces frequency and prevalence of driving after
  consuming alcohol in the warn-range BAC category'
- 'Step 4: Reduced exposure to drinking and driving incidents decreases collision
  risk and associated injuries and fatalities'

  description: The policy targeted previously untargeted BAC range (0.05-0.08%), creating
    deterrence where none existed before. The paper emphasizes that sanctions targeting
    previously untargeted groups are particularly effective.
