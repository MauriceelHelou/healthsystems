  node_name: Deterrence from Alcohol-Impaired Driving
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased police enforcement activity raises objective probability of detecting
  drunk drivers'
- 'Step 2: Higher detection rates increase perceived risk of apprehension among potential
  offenders'
- 'Step 3: Elevated risk perception shifts cost-benefit calculation against drunk
  driving'
- 'Step 4: Reduced frequency of alcohol-impaired driving attempts'
