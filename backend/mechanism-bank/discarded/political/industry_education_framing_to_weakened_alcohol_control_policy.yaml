to_node:
  node_id: weakened_alcohol_control_policy
  node_name: Weakened Alcohol Control Policy
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry promotes narrative that education about responsibility
  is the best solution to alcohol problems, deflecting from regulatory approaches'
- 'Step 2: Education-based framing shifts policy discourse away from proven structural
  interventions (pricing, availability restrictions, marketing controls)'
- 'Step 3: Individual responsibility narrative undermines political support for population-level
  regulatory measures'
- 'Step 4: Policy environment becomes less favorable to effective alcohol control
  measures, resulting in weaker or absent regulations'
