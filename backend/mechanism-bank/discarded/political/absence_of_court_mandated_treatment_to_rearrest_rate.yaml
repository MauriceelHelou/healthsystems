mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Release from hospital to community without court-imposed treatment conditions
  creates no legal obligation or monitoring structure for mental health service engagement'
- 'Step 2: Voluntary treatment systems face barriers including lack of care coordination,
  insufficient community mental health resources, and individual access challenges'
- 'Step 3: Without structured treatment engagement, serious mental illness remains
  untreated or inadequately managed in community settings'
- 'Step 4: Untreated serious mental illness increases vulnerability to behaviors resulting
  in criminal justice system involvement'
