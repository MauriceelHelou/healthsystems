direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Comprehensive marketing regulations restrict the volume, placement, and
  content of alcohol advertising across media channels accessible to youth'
- 'Step 2: Reduced industry marketing activity in regulated channels decreases the
  frequency and reach of alcohol marketing messages targeting youth audiences'
- 'Step 3: Restrictions on marketing in youth-oriented venues, events, and media platforms
  reduce incidental and targeted exposure among young people'
- 'Step 4: Lower overall marketing exposure reduces youth susceptibility to alcohol
  advertising messages and normalizing effects of ubiquitous alcohol promotion'
