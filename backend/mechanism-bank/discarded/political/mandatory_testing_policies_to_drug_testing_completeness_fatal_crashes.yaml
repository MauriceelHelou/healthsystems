direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory testing policies establish legal requirements for substance testing
  in fatal crash investigations'
- 'Step 2: Legal mandates standardize testing protocols across jurisdictions, reducing
  variation in testing practices based on individual judgment or resource constraints'
- 'Step 3: Standardized mandatory testing ensures more complete data collection across
  all driver types, including surviving drivers and those not at fault'
- 'Step 4: Increased testing completeness improves surveillance data quality and enables
  unbiased estimates of drugged driving prevalence'

  description: Mandatory policies would have the greatest impact on improving testing
    rates for surviving drivers, where current testing rates are lowest (14.0% median
    for non-transported survivors vs. 70.8% for deceased drivers)

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: States with existing BAC testing infrastructure would more easily implement
    mandatory drug testing policies through existing laboratory and personnel resources
