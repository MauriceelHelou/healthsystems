mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OHS activities are more focused on tertiary prevention (treating existing
  problems) than primary and secondary prevention (prevention and early intervention)'
- 'Step 2: Primary and secondary prevention opportunities are missed, allowing alcohol
  use patterns to develop and progress without early intervention'
- 'Step 3: Employees only receive attention after alcohol-related problems have already
  caused health and work performance deterioration'
- 'Step 4: Late-stage interventions are less effective and more costly, resulting
  in worse health outcomes compared to earlier prevention approaches'
