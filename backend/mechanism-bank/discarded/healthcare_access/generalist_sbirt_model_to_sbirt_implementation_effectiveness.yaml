direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care providers deliver brief interventions directly during routine
  visits, eliminating need for handoff to behavioral health specialists'
- 'Step 2: Integration into existing clinical workflow reduces barriers to service
  delivery and decreases patient drop-off between screening and intervention'
- 'Step 3: Greater proportion of adolescents who screen positive receive brief intervention
  within the same visit, increasing penetration of preventive services'
