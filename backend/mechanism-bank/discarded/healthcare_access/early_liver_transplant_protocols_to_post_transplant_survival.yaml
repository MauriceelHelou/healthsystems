mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early liver transplant protocols allow transplantation for severe alcohol-associated
  liver disease with <6 months abstinence'
- 'Step 2: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure from alcohol receive life-saving
  transplant who would otherwise die waiting for 6-month abstinence milestone'
- 'Step 3: Transplantation provides definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease
  regardless of etiology'
- 'Step 4: Despite higher rates of post-transplant alcohol use, overall survival remains
  excellent due to successful graft function and medical management'
