direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural barriers create systematically lower screening participation
  among people with IDD'
- 'Step 2: Reduced screening eliminates early detection opportunities during pre-symptomatic
  disease phases'
- 'Step 3: Cancers remain undetected until symptomatic presentation at more advanced
  stages'
- 'Step 4: Time from cancer onset to diagnosis increases, constituting diagnostic
  delay'

    the impact of reduced screening on diagnostic delay is more pronounced than for
    cancers without standard screening (lung cancer in most populations)
