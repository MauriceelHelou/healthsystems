direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: No official standardized detoxification protocols exist for GHB withdrawal
  syndrome'
- 'Step 2: Treatment decisions rely on clinical judgment based on benzodiazepine therapy'
- 'Step 3: When benzodiazepine monotherapy is ineffective, combination approaches
  with barbiturates or antipsychotics are used'
- 'Step 4: Lack of standardization creates variation in treatment quality and safety
  across healthcare settings'
