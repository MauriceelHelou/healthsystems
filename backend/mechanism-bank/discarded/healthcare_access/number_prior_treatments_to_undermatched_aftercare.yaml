category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with multiple prior treatments may develop provider perceptions
  of treatment resistance or poor prognosis'
- 'Step 2: These perceptions may lead to less intensive aftercare recommendations
  despite continued need'
- 'Step 3: Systemic barriers in treatment systems may limit access to appropriate
  intensity of care for patients with complex treatment histories'
- 'Step 4: Result is placement in lower intensity aftercare than clinically indicated
  by standardized assessment'
