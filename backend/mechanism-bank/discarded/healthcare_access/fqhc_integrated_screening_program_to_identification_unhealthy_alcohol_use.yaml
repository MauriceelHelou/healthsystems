mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Routine AUDIT-C screening embedded in primary care workflow identifies
  alcohol use among patients who access federally qualified health centers'
- 'Step 2: Universal screening approach eliminates provider bias in deciding who to
  screen, reducing disparities in detection'
- 'Step 3: 16% of 3,959 screened patients identified as having potentially risky alcohol
  use, enabling early intervention before severe consequences develop'
- 'Step 4: Integration with telephone follow-up system ensures identified patients
  receive further assessment and care coordination'
