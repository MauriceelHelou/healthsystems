direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hospital visit with AUD diagnosis represents healthcare system contact
  and formal recognition of substance use disorder requiring treatment'
- 'Step 2: Hospital diagnosis creates opportunity for treatment initiation, discharge
  planning, and connection to ongoing pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 3: Among 10,394 individuals with hospital-based AUD diagnosis eligible for
  medication coverage, only 37 received first-line medications, indicating 99.6% treatment
  gap'
- 'Step 4: Lack of care continuity and integration between acute hospital care and
  community-based addiction treatment results in missed therapeutic opportunities
  during critical recovery window'
