direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy-restricted access to SLK results in liver-only transplantation for
  patients with concurrent kidney disease'
- 'Step 2: Persistent renal dysfunction creates physiological vulnerability in the
  post-transplant period'
- 'Step 3: Compromised kidney function limits medication tolerance and increases metabolic
  complications'
- 'Step 4: Elevated systemic inflammation and impaired clearance of toxins contribute
  to allograft dysfunction'
- 'Step 5: Two-fold increased adjusted risk of graft failure within first year post-transplant'
