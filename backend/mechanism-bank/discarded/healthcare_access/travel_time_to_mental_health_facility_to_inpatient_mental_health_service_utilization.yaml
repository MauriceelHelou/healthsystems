direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: For most mental disorders, inpatient service utilization is not affected
  by geographic distance due to the acute and mandatory nature of inpatient admissions'
- 'Step 2: For organic mental disorders specifically, distance creates barriers to
  inpatient service access'
- 'Step 3: The severity and acute nature of conditions requiring hospitalization may
  override distance barriers for most psychiatric conditions'
- 'Step 4: Centralized inpatient facilities can serve populations without significant
  geographic access inequities except for specific diagnostic categories'
