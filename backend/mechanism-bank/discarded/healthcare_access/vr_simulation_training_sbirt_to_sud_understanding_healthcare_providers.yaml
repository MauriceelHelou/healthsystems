direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Virtual reality simulation exposes students to realistic patient presentations
  of substance use disorders in mental health and primary care contexts'
- 'Step 2: Immersive scenarios demonstrate the complexity and variability of SUDs
  across different patient populations and clinical settings'
- 'Step 3: Educational sessions integrated with simulation provide evidence-based
  frameworks for understanding SUDs as medical conditions rather than moral failings'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced understanding of SUDs reduces stigma and improves provider ability
  to identify and appropriately respond to substance use issues'
