mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) gain access to liver
  transplantation'
- 'Step 2: Transplantation provides definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease
  that cannot be managed medically'
- 'Step 3: Post-transplant care and immunosuppression prevent graft rejection and
  maintain liver function'
- 'Step 4: Improved survival rates observed in transplant recipients compared to patients
  awaiting transplant or managed medically'

    when patients are carefully selected, suggesting sobriety duration alone may not
    predict outcomes
