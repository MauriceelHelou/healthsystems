direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Liver clinics lack systematic integration of addiction medicine specialists
  and services'
- 'Step 2: Hepatologists have insufficient addiction medicine training to identify
  and treat alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 3: Risky alcohol use remains under-recognized during routine liver clinic
  visits'
- 'Step 4: Evidence-based addiction treatments (naltrexone, acamprosate) are rarely
  prescribed, leaving alcohol dependence untreated'
