direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited implementation research (T4) exists for accelerating adoption of
  effective SAWS treatments'
- 'Step 2: Even when effective interventions are identified, they are not systematically
  translated to clinical practice'
- 'Step 3: Wide variation exists in SAWS management approaches across hospitals and
  clinicians'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience inconsistent quality of care with delayed access to
  evidence-based treatments'
