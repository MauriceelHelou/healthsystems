mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Both topiramate and naltrexone demonstrate acceptable safety profiles with
  low withdrawal rates'
- 'Step 2: Topiramate: 8% withdrawal due to side effects; Naltrexone: 5% withdrawal
  due to side effects'
- 'Step 3: Tolerable medication regimens allow patients to remain in treatment over
  12-week period'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement with pharmacotherapy enables medication effects to
  reduce drinking and support recovery'
