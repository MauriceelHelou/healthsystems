direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: African American individuals with chronic hepatitis B experience differential
  healthcare engagement patterns within the North American healthcare system'
- 'Step 2: These patterns result in lower rates of antiviral treatment initiation
  (4.8 per 100 person-years) compared to Asian individuals (9.9 per 100 person-years)
  and White individuals (6.6 per 100 person-years)'
- 'Step 3: However, among those meeting guideline-based criteria for treatment, initiation
  rates converge to similar levels (62% cumulative percentage) across racial groups'
- 'Step 4: This suggests the disparity operates primarily through differential application
  of or adherence to treatment criteria rather than treatment access once criteria
  are met'
