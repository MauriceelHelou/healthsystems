direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of protocol substitutes clonidine and gabapentin for benzodiazepines
  in managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome in trauma patients'
- 'Step 2: Clonidine (alpha-2 agonist) and gabapentin (GABA analog) provide alternative
  mechanisms for managing autonomic hyperactivity and neural excitation associated
  with alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: Alternative medications reduce withdrawal symptoms through different pharmacological
  pathways, decreasing maximum daily CIWA-Ar scores'
- 'Step 4: Lower withdrawal severity reduces clinical complications and adverse outcomes
  in hospitalized trauma patients'

  description: Similar admission alcohol levels (99 vs 149 mg/dL, p=0.06) between
    groups suggests protocol effectiveness regardless of initial alcohol intoxication
