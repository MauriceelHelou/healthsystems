direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low training penetration rate among emergency department and ward staff
  on alcohol screening and harm reduction policies'
- 'Step 2: Health professionals lack knowledge and confidence in using standardized
  assessment tools and implementing zero alcohol recommendations'
- 'Step 3: Without clear training on patient follow-up procedures and screening acceptability,
  providers deprioritize alcohol screening relative to acute care needs'
- 'Step 4: Systematic screening and early intervention for harmful alcohol use is
  not implemented, missing opportunities to prevent alcohol-related morbidity and
  mortality'
