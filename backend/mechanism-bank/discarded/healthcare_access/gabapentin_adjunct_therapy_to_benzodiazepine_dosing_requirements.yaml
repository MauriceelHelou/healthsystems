mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentin is prescribed as adjunctive therapy alongside symptom-triggered
  benzodiazepine protocol for alcohol withdrawal management'
- 'Step 2: In theory, gabapentin''s GABAergic effects could reduce withdrawal symptom
  severity'
- 'Step 3: Reduced symptom severity would decrease trigger scores on withdrawal assessment
  scales'
- 'Step 4: Lower trigger scores would result in fewer as-needed benzodiazepine administrations'
- 'Step 5: However, study found no significant difference in benzodiazepine usage
  between groups'
