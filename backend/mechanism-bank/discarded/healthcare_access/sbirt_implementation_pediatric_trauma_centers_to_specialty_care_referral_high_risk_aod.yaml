direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SBIRT implementation establishes protocol for referring high-risk adolescents
  to specialty substance use services'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers limit specialty referral execution (e.g., limited specialty
  treatment capacity, insurance restrictions, geographic access barriers, lack of
  adolescent-specific services)'
- 'Step 3: Low specialty referral rates leave high-risk adolescents without intensive
  intervention needed for substance use disorders'
