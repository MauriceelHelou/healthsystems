mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ESTEEM intervention addresses minority stress through LGBQ-affirmative
  cognitive behavioral therapy'
- 'Step 2: Treatment reduces anxiety related to sexual minority stigma, discrimination
  experiences, and internalized heterosexism'
- 'Step 3: Black and Latino men experience particularly high minority stress due to
  intersecting racial and sexual minority stigma'
- 'Step 4: Addressing these compounded structural stressors leads to greater anxiety
  reduction in racially/ethnically minoritized participants'
