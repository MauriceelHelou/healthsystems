mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structured five-step process provides operational framework for non-Aboriginal
  services to systematically assess and improve cultural responsiveness'
- 'Step 2: Implementation includes engagement across staff at multiple seniority levels
  and allocation of resources to identify service delivery barriers specific to Indigenous
  populations'
- 'Step 3: Services adapt delivery models and practices to address unique needs of
  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander treatment sub-groups'
- 'Step 4: Improved cultural responsiveness reduces structural and cultural barriers
  within mainstream healthcare settings that historically deterred Indigenous people
  from seeking treatment'
