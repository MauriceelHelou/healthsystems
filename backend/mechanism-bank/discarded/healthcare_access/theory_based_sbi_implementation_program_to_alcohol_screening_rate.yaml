- 'Step 1: Theory-driven training program targets organizational and provider-level
  barriers to implementing alcohol screening using Behaviour Change Wheel/Theoretical
  Domains Framework'
- 'Step 2: Training delivered over 12 weeks with ongoing support reduces perceived
  barriers and increases alcohol-related knowledge among healthcare providers'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced provider capacity and reduced implementation barriers enable systematic
  screening of eligible patients during primary care visits'
- 'Step 4: Increased screening activity creates opportunity for early detection of
  problematic alcohol use in the population'
