mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Virtual reality simulation provides immersive, realistic scenarios for
  practicing SBIRT techniques in mental health and primary care settings'
- 'Step 2: Structured prebriefing and debriefing sessions facilitate active learning
  and reflection on SBIRT characteristics, screening tools, and clinical guidelines'
- 'Step 3: Experiential learning through simulation enables students to apply theoretical
  knowledge in practice contexts'
- 'Step 4: Increased knowledge of screening tools and alcohol consumption guidelines
  enhances provider capacity to identify substance use disorders early'
