  node_name: Sustained Retention in Addiction Treatment
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Immediate treatment access following withdrawal management capitalizes
  on critical window of opportunity when patients are medically stabilized and motivated
  for recovery'
- 'Step 2: First successful appointment establishes therapeutic relationship and initiates
  medication-assisted treatment, creating foundation for ongoing engagement'
- 'Step 3: Early care connection provides patients with support systems and coping
  strategies before high-risk period of post-detoxification relapse'
- 'Step 4: Consistent engagement pattern established in early treatment phase increases
  likelihood of long-term retention through habit formation and trust building'
