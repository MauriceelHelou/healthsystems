direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systemic barriers exist in healthcare delivery systems preventing access
  to alcohol use disorder treatment services'
- 'Step 2: These barriers reduce the availability and accessibility of evidence-based
  addiction treatment for patients with advanced alcohol-associated liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access leads to underutilization of alcohol use disorder treatment
  even among patients with life-threatening disease'
- 'Step 4: Treatment underutilization perpetuates continued alcohol use and prevents
  achievement of abstinence necessary for improved outcomes'
