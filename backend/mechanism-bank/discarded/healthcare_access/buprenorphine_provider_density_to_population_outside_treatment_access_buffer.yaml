mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: National provider density of 14.3 per 100,000 persons indicates insufficient
  treatment capacity relative to opioid use disorder prevalence'
- 'Step 2: Low provider density means greater average distance between any given location
  and nearest provider'
- 'Step 3: Populations in areas with lowest provider density face longest travel distances
  and greatest access barriers'
- 'Step 4: Geographic access barriers translate to reduced treatment initiation and
  retention'
