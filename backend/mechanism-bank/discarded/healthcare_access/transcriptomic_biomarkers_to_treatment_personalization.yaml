  node_id: treatment_personalization
  node_name: Personalized AUD Treatment Selection
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transcriptomic data captures genetic and environmental factors associated
  with AUD through RNA expression patterns'
- 'Step 2: AI and systems biology methods analyze complex biomolecular networks to
  identify patient subgroups'
- 'Step 3: Objective molecular markers enable stratification of heterogeneous AUD
  population into treatment-responsive groups'
- 'Step 4: Clinicians can match patients to optimal pharmacotherapy (naltrexone, acamprosate,
  disulfiram) based on biomarker profiles'
- 'Step 5: Personalized treatment selection improves clinical outcomes through targeted
  interventions'
