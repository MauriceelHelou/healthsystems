direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Only 9.7% of patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis and high-risk alcohol
  use receive MAUD despite evidence of efficacy'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers including lack of provider training, prescribing authority
  restrictions, and inadequate integration of addiction treatment into hepatology
  prevent wider adoption'
- 'Step 3: Patients continue hazardous alcohol use without evidence-based pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Continued alcohol consumption drives cirrhosis progression, decompensation,
  and mortality'
- 'Step 5: Population-level excess mortality occurs due to treatment gap'
