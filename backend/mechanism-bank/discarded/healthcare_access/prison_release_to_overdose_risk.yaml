direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prison incarceration results in loss of opioid tolerance during forced
  abstinence or reduced access to opioids'
- 'Step 2: Release from prison creates abrupt return to community with high drug availability
  but reduced physiological tolerance'
- 'Step 3: Biopsychosocial risk factors accumulate during incarceration including
  trauma, disrupted social networks, and lack of continuity of care'
- 'Step 4: Combination of reduced tolerance and environmental stressors increases
  vulnerability to fatal overdose upon release'
