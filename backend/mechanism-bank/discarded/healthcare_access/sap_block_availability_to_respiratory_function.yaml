mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SAP block reduces chest wall pain from multiple rib fractures through regional
  anesthesia'
- 'Step 2: Decreased pain allows improved chest wall expansion and deeper respiratory
  effort without pain limitation'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced ventilation improves gas exchange and reduces atelectasis risk'
- 'Step 4: Higher SpO2/FiO2 ratio indicates improved oxygenation in SAP block group
  compared to standard therapy'
