direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems lack protocols or mandate for routine IPV screening
  among female spouses of alcohol-dependent patients'
- 'Step 2: Without proactive screening, clinicians miss opportunities to identify
  IPV in clinical encounters'
- 'Step 3: Survivors face barriers to spontaneous disclosure due to stigma and safety
  concerns'
- 'Step 4: Unidentified IPV cases result in lack of psychosocial interventions and
  continued exposure to violence'
