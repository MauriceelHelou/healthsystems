direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system implements pharmacogenetic testing infrastructure enabling
  OPRM1 genotype screening for alcohol use disorder patients'
- 'Step 2: Genetic testing results guide clinical decision-making for medication selection
  (naltrexone vs acamprosate)'
- 'Step 3: Personalized medication allocation improves treatment efficacy and reduces
  adverse medication-related outcomes in matched patient subgroups'
- 'Step 4: Improved treatment response translates to increased quality-adjusted life
  years through reduced relapse, better functioning, and improved quality of life'
