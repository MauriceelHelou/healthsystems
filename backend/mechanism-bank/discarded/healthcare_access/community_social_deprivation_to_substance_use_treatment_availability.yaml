mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Communities with high social deprivation (characterized by high poverty
  rates, lack of motor vehicle access, renter-occupied housing, low educational attainment,
  and high nonemployment) have lower land and property costs'
- 'Step 2: Lower property costs make it more affordable for substance use treatment
  facilities to establish and maintain operations in these areas'
- 'Step 3: Stigma associated with substance use services creates community resistance
  in more affluent areas, leading services to locate where there is least resistance
  to their presence'
- 'Step 4: The combination of affordability and reduced community opposition results
  in greater concentration of treatment services in socially deprived communities'
