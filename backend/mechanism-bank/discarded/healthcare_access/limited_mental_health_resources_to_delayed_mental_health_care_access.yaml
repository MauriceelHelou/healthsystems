direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Arab countries have limited mental health infrastructure and resources
  at the systemic level'
- 'Step 2: Scarcity of services creates structural barriers to timely mental health
  care including long wait times, geographic barriers, and inadequate provider networks'
- 'Step 3: These structural barriers compound with social barriers like stigma to
  further delay help-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Delayed access leads to worsening mental health outcomes and untreated
  mental illness in the population'
