direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of validated disease-specific nutrition assessment tools limits
  ability to standardize nutritional interventions'
- 'Step 2: Lack of standardized measurement prevents rigorous evaluation of nutritional
  therapy effectiveness'
- 'Step 3: Without evidence of effectiveness, nutritional interventions are not systematically
  implemented or reimbursed'
- 'Step 4: Patients lack access to potentially beneficial nutritional therapies for
  pancreatitis management'
