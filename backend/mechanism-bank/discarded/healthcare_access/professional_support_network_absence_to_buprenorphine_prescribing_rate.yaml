- 'Step 1: Absence of professional mentorship and peer support networks leaves clinicians
  isolated in managing complex opioid use disorder cases'
- 'Step 2: Isolated clinicians lack guidance on clinical protocols, patient management,
  and system navigation'

  initiate prescribing despite holding waiver'
- 'Step 4: Reduced clinician confidence limits treatment availability for patients
  with opioid use disorder'
