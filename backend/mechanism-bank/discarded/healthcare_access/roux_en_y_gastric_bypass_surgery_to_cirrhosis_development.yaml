direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: RYGB surgery alters hepatic metabolism and alcohol processing due to anatomical
  changes in gastrointestinal tract'
- 'Step 2: Altered absorption patterns lead to different alcohol pharmacokinetics
  and potentially higher peak blood alcohol concentrations'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced hepatotoxic effects and metabolic stress accelerate liver fibrosis
  progression'
- 'Step 4: Faster progression from alcohol-associated hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs
  in RYGB patients'
