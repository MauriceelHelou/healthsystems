direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multi-step referral processes requiring patient-initiated contact create
  multiple points of failure, particularly for patients lacking stable phone access,
  transportation, or experience navigating healthcare bureaucracy'
- 'Step 2: Time delays between withdrawal management discharge and treatment initiation
  allow window for relapse, loss of motivation, or competing survival needs (housing,
  food) to take priority'
- 'Step 3: Requirement for patients to independently navigate unfamiliar clinic locations
  and intake procedures creates barriers disproportionate to their functional capacity
  during early recovery'
- 'Step 4: Absence of structural support during transition period results in majority
  of patients never connecting to ongoing care despite initial treatment-seeking behavior'
