mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CBT-I includes sleep restriction and stimulus control components that consolidate
  sleep periods'
- 'Step 2: Behavioral interventions reduce time awake in bed and strengthen sleep-wake
  homeostasis'
- 'Step 3: Sleep efficiency (ratio of time asleep to time in bed) improves as sleep
  becomes more consolidated'
- 'Step 4: Effects strengthen over time as behavioral patterns become established'
