direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized clinical decision rules (PECARN) provide structured criteria
  for when to order CT imaging in pediatric minor head trauma'
- 'Step 2: These rules maintain statistical predictive validity for intracranial damage
  across different presentation timeframes'
- 'Step 3: Consistent application reduces both unnecessary radiation exposure from
  over-imaging and missed injuries from under-imaging'
- 'Step 4: Presence of PECARN indications predicted traumatic CT abnormalities regardless
  of timing of presentation'
