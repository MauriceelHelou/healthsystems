mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SSL implementation strategy includes protocols for referring high-risk
  adolescents to primary care providers or specialty services'
- 'Step 2: Trauma center staff attempt to connect identified adolescents with continuation
  of AOD discussions after discharge'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers in care transitions, insurance coverage, or community
  service availability impede referral completion'
- 'Step 4: Referral to treatment remains low despite implementation efforts, revealing
  gaps in post-discharge care coordination infrastructure'
