mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: New MASLD diagnostic criteria require presence of at least one cardiometabolic
  risk factor (BMI ≥25 kg/m², type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, etc.)'
- 'Step 2: 99% of NAFLD database patients and 94.71% of NHANES NAFLD participants
  met MASLD criteria, showing high concordance (Cohen''s kappa 0.968, 95% CI 0.962-0.973)'
- 'Step 3: High concordance between diagnostic frameworks allows interchangeable use
  of NAFLD and MASLD evidence base for clinical decision-making and risk stratification'
