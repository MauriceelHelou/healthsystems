mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Daily oral dosing requires consistent patient-initiated medication taking
  behavior'
- 'Step 2: Daily decisions about medication create multiple opportunities for missed
  doses'
- 'Step 3: Life disruptions, competing demands, and structural barriers (work schedules,
  unstable housing) interfere with daily routines'
- 'Step 4: Lack of healthcare system involvement in daily administration reduces structural
  support for adherence'

  description: At 9 and 12 months, acamprosate had significantly higher adherence
    compared to oral naltrexone, suggesting oral naltrexone adherence worsens over
