mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system implements alcohol brief intervention for patients with
  type 2 diabetes who screen positive for unhealthy alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Intervention aims to reduce alcohol consumption that may interfere with
  diabetes management'
- 'Step 3: However, no significant associations were observed between brief intervention
  and change in HbA1c levels'
- 'Step 4: No significant associations found between brief intervention and achievement
  of controlled HbA1c (<8%) at 18-month follow-up'
