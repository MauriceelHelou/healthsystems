- 'Step 1: Availability of novel pharmacotherapeutic options (such as psilocybin-assisted
  therapy) expands treatment choices beyond traditional approaches'
- 'Step 2: Patients who have not responded to conventional treatments (naltrexone,
  acamprosate, disulfiram) gain access to alternative mechanisms of action'
- 'Step 3: Increased treatment options improve patient-treatment matching based on
  individual needs and preferences'
- 'Step 4: Greater engagement and retention in treatment leads to improved drinking
  outcomes and sustained recovery'
