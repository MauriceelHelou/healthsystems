category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency departments with higher pediatric readiness have specialized
  equipment, trained staff, and protocols for managing injured children'
- 'Step 2: These resources enable rapid assessment, appropriate resuscitation, and
  timely definitive care for pediatric trauma patients'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced care quality and reduced treatment delays result in improved survival
  outcomes for injured children'
- 'Step 4: Long-term survival is independently associated with higher emergency department
  pediatric readiness levels'
