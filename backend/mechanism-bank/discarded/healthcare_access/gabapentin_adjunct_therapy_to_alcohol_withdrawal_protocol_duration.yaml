mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentin prescribed alongside symptom-triggered benzodiazepine protocol
  for alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 2: If effective, gabapentin would accelerate withdrawal symptom resolution'

  protocol'
- 'Step 4: Study found median duration similar between groups (4 days vs 3 days with
  no significant difference)'
