  node_name: Delayed Clinical Identification of GHB Cases
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited information exists about GHB abuse and distribution patterns among
  general population'
- 'Step 2: Lack of surveillance data reduces clinical awareness and suspicion for
  GHB-related presentations'
- 'Step 3: Delayed or missed identification occurs in both acute poisoning and withdrawal
  scenarios'
- 'Step 4: Need for testing in conventional and non-conventional biological matrices
  is not prioritized'
