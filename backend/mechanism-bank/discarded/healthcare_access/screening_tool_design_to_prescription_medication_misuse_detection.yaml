direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Screening tools with specific questions about prescription medication nonmedical
  use or misuse create opportunities for systematic detection in primary care settings'
- 'Step 2: Different question formats and framing yield varying rates of disclosure
  from adolescent patients (8.5% vs 1.7% vs 1.3% across three tools)'
- 'Step 3: Higher detection rates enable earlier identification of at-risk youth who
  may otherwise remain undetected between routine care visits'
- 'Step 4: Early detection creates opportunity for brief intervention and referral
  to specialized treatment services before progression to substance use disorders'
