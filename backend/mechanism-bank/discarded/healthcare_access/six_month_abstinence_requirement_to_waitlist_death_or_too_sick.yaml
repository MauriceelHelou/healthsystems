direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory 6-month abstinence period acts as a structural barrier that delays
  listing for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)'
- 'Step 2: Delayed listing means patients must demonstrate liver function improvement
  through abstinence before transplant eligibility'
- 'Step 3: Patients who successfully achieve abstinence and listing demonstrate improved
  liver function and clinical stability'
- 'Step 4: Improved baseline health status at listing leads to reduced risk of death
  or clinical deterioration while on wait-list'

  description: Women with ALD had higher risk of wait-list removal for death or being
    too sick (SHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P<0.001) compared to men with ALD, suggesting
    protective effect of listing criteria is weaker for women
