direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Injectable formulations (extended-release naltrexone) require less frequent
  dosing (monthly) compared to daily oral medications'
- 'Step 2: Reduced dosing frequency decreases barriers to consistent medication availability
  and use'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare system structures medication access around formulation type,
  with injectable requiring scheduled clinical visits that facilitate adherence monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Higher adherence rates for injectable formulations (54.6%) compared to
  oral formulations (41.3-49.8%) support treatment engagement'
