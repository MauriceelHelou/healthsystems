direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Interpersonal violence results in acute injuries requiring immediate medical
  attention'
- 'Step 2: Violence-related presentations significantly more often arrive via ambulance
  service or directly to trauma room compared to other trauma presentations'
- 'Step 3: Violence group requires significantly more diagnostic imaging (CT scans)
  due to head injuries and concomitant alcohol intoxication complicating clinical
  assessment'
- 'Step 4: Significantly more surgical wound care is required for violence-related
  injuries, with frequent inpatient admissions'
- 'Step 5: The violence group represents a relevant cost factor for the healthcare
  system'
