mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PSH programs with high-intensity services provide integrated mental health
  and substance use treatment on-site or through coordinated referrals'
- 'Step 2: Co-location of services in or near housing reduces transportation and logistical
  barriers to treatment engagement for individuals with dual diagnosis'
- 'Step 3: Higher staff-to-resident ratios in intensive service models enable more
  frequent contact, crisis intervention, and care coordination'
- 'Step 4: Integrated service models address co-occurring disorders simultaneously
  rather than requiring navigation of separate, fragmented treatment systems'
