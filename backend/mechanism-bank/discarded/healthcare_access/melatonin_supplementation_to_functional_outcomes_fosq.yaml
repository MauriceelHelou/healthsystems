- 'Step 1: Melatonin improves sleep quality and reduces insomnia symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Better sleep enhances daytime alertness and cognitive function'
- 'Step 3: Improved alertness and energy increase capacity for daily activities'
- 'Step 4: FOSQ-10 scores increase reflecting better functional outcomes across life
  domains'
