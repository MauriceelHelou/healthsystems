mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized BAWS protocol enables systematic early detection of withdrawal
  symptoms through regular assessments'
- 'Step 2: Symptom-triggered dosing allows timely benzodiazepine administration when
  clinically indicated'
- 'Step 3: Structured monitoring prevents escalation of mild-moderate symptoms to
  severe withdrawal'
- 'Step 4: Only 2.1% of patients developed severe withdrawal, indicating effective
  prevention through protocol-driven care'
