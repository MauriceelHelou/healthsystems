mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transplant programs with greater volume and experience develop optimized
  patient selection protocols'
- 'Step 2: Experienced centers demonstrate improved survival outcomes (>83% at 1-year)
  in retrospective studies'
- 'Step 3: Demonstrated success increases willingness to transplant high-risk ACLF
  patients'
- 'Step 4: However, most programs still only transplant 0-10% of eligible ACLF-2 and
  ACLF-3 patients, suggesting persistent access barriers'
