mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universal screening using AUDIT-C at primary care visits identifies patients
  with risky alcohol use who would not otherwise receive assessment'
- 'Step 2: Systematic telephone follow-up ensures patients receive comprehensive AUDIT
  assessment and appropriate intervention based on risk level'
- 'Step 3: Social worker-delivered brief intervention provides skills and motivation
  for behavior change without requiring specialty addiction treatment access'
- 'Step 4: Integration of pharmacotherapy and addiction medicine referral for high-risk
  patients (AUDIT>12) provides stepped care matched to need'
- 'Step 5: Mean AUDIT score decreased by 4.1 points at 3-6 month follow-up among 251
  patients with complete data'
