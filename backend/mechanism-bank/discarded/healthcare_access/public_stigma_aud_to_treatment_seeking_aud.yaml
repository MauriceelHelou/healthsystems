mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public stigma creates a social environment where AUD is viewed through
  lens of difference, disdain, and blame'
- 'Step 2: Stigmatizing attitudes reduce active support strategies from community
  members and increase avoidance'
- 'Step 3: Lack of social support and encouragement acts as structural barrier to
  initiating treatment-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment-seeking results in minority of individuals with AUD accessing
  needed care'
- 'Step 5: Untreated AUD leads to worse health outcomes and perpetuates cycle of stigma'
