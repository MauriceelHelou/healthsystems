  node_name: Preference for General Practitioner Consultation for Alcohol Use Disorders
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Both high and low levels of public stigma create different motivations
  for preferring general practitioners over specialized treatment'
- 'Step 2: Low stigma reduces barriers to seeking any help, making general practitioners
  an accessible first point of contact'
- 'Step 3: High stigma may drive preference for general practitioners as a less stigmatizing,
  more private, and less specialized setting compared to addiction-specific services'
- 'Step 4: General practitioner settings offer perceived anonymity and normalization
  of health concerns that may reduce stigma-related barriers'
