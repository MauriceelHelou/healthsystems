mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IoT system detects alcohol intoxication combined with physiological impairment
  (abnormal heart rate or drowsiness) in driver'
- 'Step 2: System automatically sends real-time alerts via mobile app to pre-designated
  contacts (family, friends) and nearest law enforcement'
- 'Step 3: Rapid notification enables intervention before driving occurs or facilitates
  quick response if driver is in distress'
- 'Step 4: Earlier intervention and assistance reduces likelihood of fatal crashes
  and enables medical help for impaired individuals'
