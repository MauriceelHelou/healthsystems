- 'Step 1: QWT''s extended duration and psychosocial components improve treatment
  outcomes and reduce relapse rates'
- 'Step 2: Reduced relapse to problematic alcohol use decreases acute intoxication
  episodes and withdrawal complications'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of alcohol-related complications reduce need for emergency
  and inpatient medical care'
- 'Step 4: Overall hospitalization burden decreases across the population'
