mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standard monoaminergic antidepressants and mood stabilizers show limited
  efficacy for fatigue in bipolar depression, creating treatment gaps'
- 'Step 2: Intranasal ketamine bypasses cost and access barriers associated with intravenous
  administration, making rapid-acting treatment more available'
- 'Step 3: Single 50mg intranasal dose produces rapid anti-fatigue effects through
  glutamatergic modulation within 4-48 hours'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with bipolar depression I/II experiencing active depressive
  episodes show significant fatigue reduction compared to placebo'
