mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Automated system ensures consistent delivery of brief intervention and
  follow-up to patients with positive alcohol screens'
- 'Step 2: Standardized brief intervention content addresses risks and provides strategies
  to reduce harmful drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: One-month automated follow-up visit reinforces intervention and assesses
  progress without requiring clinical appointments'
- 'Step 4: Reduced harmful drinking behaviors lead to fewer negative consequences
  related to alcohol use over 3-month period'
