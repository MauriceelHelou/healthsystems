mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic disrupts access to physical and mental healthcare while
  increasing health stressors (infection risk, isolation, grief)'
- 'Step 2: Deteriorating physical and mental health conditions go untreated or undertreated
  due to healthcare system overwhelm and access barriers'
- 'Step 3: Untreated co-occurring conditions (chronic pain, depression, anxiety, PTSD)
  reduce capacity for recovery and increase relapse risk'
- 'Step 4: Combined burden of worsening health and inadequate treatment leads to increased
  substance-related consequences including overdose, medical complications, and functional
  impairment'
