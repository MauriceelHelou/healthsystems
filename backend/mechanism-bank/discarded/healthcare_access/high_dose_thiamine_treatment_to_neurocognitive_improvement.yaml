mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Administration of high-dose intravenous thiamine (1200mg day 1, 200mg days
  2-4) rapidly replenishes thiamine stores in neural tissue'
- 'Step 2: Restored thiamine reactivates thiamine-dependent enzymes critical for glucose
  metabolism and neuronal energy production'
- 'Step 3: Recovery of neuronal function reverses acute encephalopathy and improves
  cognitive processing, memory consolidation, and motor coordination'
- 'Step 4: Within 5 days of treatment initiation, measurable improvements occur in
  Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores, delayed recall, and gait/coordination'
