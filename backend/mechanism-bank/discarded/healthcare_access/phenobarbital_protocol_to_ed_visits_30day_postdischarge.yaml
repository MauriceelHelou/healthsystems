mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Phenobarbital-based protocol provides more sustained management of alcohol
  withdrawal physiology during index hospitalization'
- 'Step 2: Longer-acting medication reduces rebound withdrawal symptoms in post-discharge
  period'
- 'Step 3: More stable clinical condition at discharge reduces acute symptom recurrence
  requiring emergency care'
- 'Step 4: Decreased need for emergency department utilization reflects better overall
  withdrawal syndrome resolution'
