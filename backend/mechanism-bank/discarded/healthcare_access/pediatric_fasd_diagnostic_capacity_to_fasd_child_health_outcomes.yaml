- 'Step 1: American Academy of Pediatrics Champion program trains pediatricians in
  FASD diagnostic skills and recognition of clinical presentations'
- 'Step 2: Increased diagnostic capacity enables earlier and more accurate identification
  of children with FASDs in pediatric care settings'
- 'Step 3: Timely FASD diagnosis facilitates access to appropriate developmental services,
  educational accommodations, behavioral interventions, and family support'
- 'Step 4: Early intervention services and targeted supports improve developmental
  trajectories and functional outcomes for children with FASDs'
