mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smartphone-delivered intervention provides immediate accessibility to personalized
  feedback following drinking episodes during optimal intervention timing (mornings
  after drinking)'
- 'Step 2: Theory-based personalized feedback components include reflection on drinking
  consequences and normative feedback about peer drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Daily and biweekly feedback delivery maintains engagement and provides
  repeated opportunities for behavior modification through morning evaluation'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness of personal drinking patterns and consequences relative
  to peers reduces subsequent heavy drinking episodes'

    intervention timing when consequences are salient and motivation for change may

  description: Daily feedback reviewed 45.5% of times offered and biweekly feedback
    viewed 50-56% of times, suggesting moderate engagement levels that may moderate
    intervention effectiveness
