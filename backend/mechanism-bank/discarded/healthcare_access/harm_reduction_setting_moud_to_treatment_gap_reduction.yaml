direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Existing large treatment gap reflects structural inadequacy of current
  two-tiered system (opioid treatment programs and traditional healthcare) that fails
  to reach marginalized populations'
- 'Step 2: Integration of MOUD into harm reduction and homeless services creates third
  access point aligned with where people experiencing housing instability and poverty
  already seek services'
- 'Step 3: Removal of structural barriers (insurance requirements, appointment systems,
  abstinence-based prerequisites) enables treatment initiation for previously excluded
  populations'
- 'Step 4: Treatment gap narrows as medications first model reaches 825 newly enrolled
  participants who had difficulty engaging in traditional settings'
