category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Reduced perceived barriers lead to actual expansion of overdose education,
  naloxone distribution, and MOUD availability across community venues'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability of naloxone enables bystander intervention during
  overdoses, preventing fatal outcomes'
- 'Step 3: Expanded MOUD access increases treatment engagement and retention, reducing
  opioid use and overdose risk'
- 'Step 4: Combined harm reduction and treatment scale-up reduces community-level
  opioid overdose mortality'
