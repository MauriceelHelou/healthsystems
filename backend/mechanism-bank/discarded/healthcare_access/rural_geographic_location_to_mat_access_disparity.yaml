mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural areas have lower density of waivered physicians authorized to prescribe
  buprenorphine compared to urban areas'
- 'Step 2: Limited number of treatment providers creates capacity constraints and
  longer travel distances for patients seeking treatment'
- 'Step 3: Geographic barriers reduce treatment initiation and retention for individuals
  with opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or inadequately treated opioid use disorder leads to increased
  morbidity, mortality, and continued substance use'
