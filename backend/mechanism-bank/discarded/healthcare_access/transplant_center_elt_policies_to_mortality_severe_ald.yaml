mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Centers establish policies regarding early liver transplant for patients
  with severe alcohol-associated liver disease and <6 months predicted survival'
- 'Step 2: 96.4% of centers consider ELT when patients have <6 months survival without
  transplant, providing access to life-saving intervention'
- 'Step 3: All responding centers now evaluate patients for ELT regardless of traditional
  6-month abstinence requirements'
- 'Step 4: Expanded transplant access for critically ill patients directly prevents
  death from severe ALD'

  description: 57.1% of directors indicated patient survival as important factor for
    ELT candidate listing, prioritizing life-saving intervention

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: 37.5% indicated graft survival as important factor, with concerns about
    organ allocation potentially limiting ELT access for some patients
- name: low_relapse_risk_emphasis
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: 55.4% indicated low risk of relapse as important factor, potentially
    creating barriers for patients perceived as higher relapse risk despite lack of
    evidence that 6-month abstinence predicts relapse
