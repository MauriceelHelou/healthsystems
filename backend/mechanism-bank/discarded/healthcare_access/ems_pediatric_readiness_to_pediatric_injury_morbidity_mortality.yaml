mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: EMS systems with pediatric readiness have age-appropriate equipment, trained
  personnel, and pediatric-specific protocols for prehospital care'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced prehospital pediatric readiness enables appropriate assessment,
  stabilization, and treatment of injured children at the scene'
- 'Step 3: Pediatric-ready EMS systems improve triage decisions and transport to appropriate
  trauma centers capable of managing pediatric injuries'
- 'Step 4: Earlier appropriate intervention and correct facility selection reduce
  preventable morbidity and mortality in injured children'
