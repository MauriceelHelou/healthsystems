mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Orthopaedic patients with alcohol dependence are admitted to hospital setting
  where alcohol access is restricted'
- 'Step 2: Abrupt cessation of chronic alcohol intake triggers neuroadaptive withdrawal
  syndrome'
- 'Step 3: Acute withdrawal manifests with potentially fatal complications including
  seizures, delirium tremens, and cardiovascular instability requiring clinical management'
