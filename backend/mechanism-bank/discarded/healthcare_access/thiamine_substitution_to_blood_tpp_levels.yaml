mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine supplementation (oral 3×100mg/day for 7 days, then 1×100mg/day,
  with or without IV 3×100mg/day for 5 days) is administered during alcohol withdrawal
  treatment'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine is absorbed and converted to active form (thiamine pyrophosphate)
  in blood'
- 'Step 3: TPP accumulates in peripheral blood over 1-2 weeks of treatment'
- 'Step 4: Blood TPP levels increase substantially from baseline'
