direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinical diagnosis of substance use disorder on Medicaid claims establishes
  medical necessity for specialty treatment services'
- 'Step 2: Documented diagnosis theoretically enables referral to treatment (RT) component
  of SBIRT protocol'
- 'Step 3: Referral should facilitate connection to specialty SUD services including
  intensive outpatient, residential treatment, or medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 4: However, study found very few claims for specialty SUD services despite
  increased diagnosis rates, suggesting pathway is interrupted'
