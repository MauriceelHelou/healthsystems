mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD treatment access enables patients to receive evidence-based interventions
  including psychotherapy, group therapy, mutual aid support, and relapse prevention
  medications'
- 'Step 2: These treatments reduce alcohol consumption and support sustained abstinence
  in patients with chronic liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol exposure decreases hepatotoxic injury and inflammatory
  processes in the liver'
- 'Step 4: Decreased ongoing liver damage improves hepatic function and reduces progression
  to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 5: Improved liver function and reduced disease progression results in decreased
  mortality'
