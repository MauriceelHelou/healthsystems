mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographic distribution of MAT providers determines whether justice-involved
  individuals can access pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 2: Counties with MAT deserts create structural barriers requiring extensive
  travel or relocation for treatment'
- 'Step 3: Problem-solving courts in MAT-available counties can facilitate referrals
  and monitor treatment adherence'
- 'Step 4: Local treatment infrastructure enables continuity of care from incarceration
  through community supervision'
