mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Protocol standardizes use of clonidine and gabapentin as first-line agents
  for alcohol withdrawal management in trauma patients'
- 'Step 2: Systematic substitution of alternative medications reduces clinician reliance
  on benzodiazepines for withdrawal prophylaxis and treatment'
- 'Step 3: Reduced benzodiazepine prescribing decreases patient exposure to medications
  associated with respiratory depression, delirium, falls, and dependence'
- 'Step 4: Lower benzodiazepine exposure reduces iatrogenic harm and adverse events
  in vulnerable trauma population'
