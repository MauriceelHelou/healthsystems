direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of early screening and noninvasive testing prevents identification
  of early-stage AALD'
- 'Step 2: Absence of red flag recognition (low albumin, low platelet count, raised
  transaminases) allows silent disease progression'
- 'Step 3: Patients present only when symptomatic with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: Late-stage presentation results in higher morbidity and mortality due to
  limited treatment options'
