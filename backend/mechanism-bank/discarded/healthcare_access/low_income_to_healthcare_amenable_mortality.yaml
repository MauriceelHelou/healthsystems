direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower income creates financial and structural barriers to accessing healthcare
  services'
- 'Step 2: Economic disadvantage reduces ability to seek preventive care and early
  treatment for treatable conditions'
- 'Step 3: Lower-income individuals experience longer delays in diagnosis and treatment
  initiation'
- 'Step 4: Reduced continuity of care and medication adherence due to cost and logistical
  barriers'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effects of delayed and inadequate treatment increase mortality
  from conditions amenable to healthcare'
