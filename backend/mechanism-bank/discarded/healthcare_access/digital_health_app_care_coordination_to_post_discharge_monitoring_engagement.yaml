mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital care coordination app (Lifeguard) provides technological infrastructure
  to maintain connection between patient and peer recovery coach after physical discharge
  from inpatient setting'
- 'Step 2: Daily automated BAM prompts create structured routine for self-monitoring
  without requiring in-person visits, reducing transportation and scheduling barriers'
- 'Step 3: Real-time data transmission allows coach to identify concerning responses
  immediately and intervene proactively'
- 'Step 4: Asynchronous communication via app accommodates patients'' varying schedules
  and reduces need for synchronous contact'
