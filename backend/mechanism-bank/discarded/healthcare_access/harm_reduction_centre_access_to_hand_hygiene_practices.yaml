mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Harm reduction centres provide physical infrastructure for hygiene (sinks,
  soap, water) and education on hand-washing techniques'
- 'Step 2: Educational intervention combined with provision of single-use alcohol-based
  hand rub (MONO-RUB) increases knowledge and material capacity for hand hygiene'
- 'Step 3: Improved hand hygiene practices before injection reduce bacterial load
  on hands and at injection sites'
- 'Step 4: Reduced bacterial contamination during injection decreases risk of abscess
  formation and other SSTI'
