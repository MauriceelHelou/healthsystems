direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-urban small-town locations lack comprehensive formal service infrastructure
  for homeless youth including substance use treatment and recovery supports'
- 'Step 2: Absence of formal services forces youth to navigate competing needs between
  housing security and substance use recovery'
- 'Step 3: Limited service landscape creates impossible choices where youth must risk
  sobriety to secure shelter through informal networks'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers to accessing both housing and recovery supports simultaneously
  compromise addiction treatment outcomes'
