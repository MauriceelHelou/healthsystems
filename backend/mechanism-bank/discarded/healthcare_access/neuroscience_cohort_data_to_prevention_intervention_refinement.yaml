mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Large-scale cohort studies generate multi-level neuroscience-based information
  tracking neurodevelopment from early childhood through adolescence'
- 'Step 2: These datasets identify specific neurobiological mechanisms and developmental
  trajectories associated with substance use disorder risk'
- 'Step 3: The RDoC framework provides structure for translating multi-level neurobiological
  data into behavioral domains amenable to intervention'
- 'Step 4: Neuroscience-informed understanding of mechanisms enables development of
  more targeted, effective prevention interventions that engage specific neural systems'
