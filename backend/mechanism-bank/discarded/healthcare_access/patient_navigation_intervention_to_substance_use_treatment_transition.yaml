  detoxification discharge, addressing systemic barriers to care access'
- 'Step 2: Navigators assist in overcoming structural obstacles including transportation,
  insurance, appointment scheduling, and care coordination'
- 'Step 3: Navigation augments motivational interviewing by providing concrete resource
  support beyond motivation alone'
