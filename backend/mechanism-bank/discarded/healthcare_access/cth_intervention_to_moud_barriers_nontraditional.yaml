- 'Step 1: CTH intervention promotes expansion of medications for opioid use disorder
  beyond traditional addiction treatment settings'
- 'Step 2: Coalition activities address regulatory barriers, provider training gaps,
  and stigma preventing MOUD expansion in community venues'
- 'Step 3: Intervention facilitates partnerships between traditional healthcare providers
  and non-traditional community organizations'
- 'Step 4: Perceived barriers to providing MOUD in accessible community settings decrease,
  improving treatment access for underserved populations'
