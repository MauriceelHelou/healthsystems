direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public drug plan provides financial coverage for naltrexone and acamprosate,
  removing cost barriers for eligible beneficiaries'
- 'Step 2: Despite availability of coverage, prescribing patterns by healthcare providers
  remain extremely low following hospital-based AUD diagnosis'
- 'Step 3: Very low dispensing rate (3.56 per 1000 population) suggests systemic barriers
  beyond financial access, including potential prescriber knowledge gaps, treatment
  fragmentation, or service delivery failures'
- 'Step 4: Minimal medication dispensing limits pharmacological support for alcohol
  use disorder recovery despite evidence-based first-line treatments being covered'
