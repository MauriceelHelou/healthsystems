mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Separate systems (criminal law, family law, substance abuse services, domestic
  abuse services) operate independently without coordination'
- 'Step 2: Families with co-occurring substance misuse and domestic abuse receive
  fragmented interventions that address only one problem at a time'
- 'Step 3: Lack of holistic approach fails to address the interconnected nature of
  problems'
- 'Step 4: Interventions remain ineffective, care proceedings continue, and family
  problems persist'
