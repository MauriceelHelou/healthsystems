direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Symptom-triggered therapy protocol uses objective CIWA-Ar scoring to determine
  need for benzodiazepine administration'
- 'Step 2: Medication is administered only when withdrawal symptoms reach threshold
  severity (CIWA-Ar ≥10) rather than on fixed schedule'
- 'Step 3: Individualized dosing prevents unnecessary medication administration in
  patients with mild or resolving symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Median cumulative dose reduced to 20mg oral diazepam compared to higher
  doses typical of fixed-schedule regimens'
