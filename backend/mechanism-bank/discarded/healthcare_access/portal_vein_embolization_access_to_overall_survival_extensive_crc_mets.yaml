direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Portal vein embolization induces hypertrophy of the future liver remnant
  in patients with extensive liver metastases'
- 'Step 2: Increased liver remnant volume enables safe surgical resection in patients
  who would otherwise be ineligible'
- 'Step 3: Successful resection removes macroscopic tumor burden and provides potential
  for cure'
- 'Step 4: Subset of patients achieves long-term survival, though overall outcomes
  remain inferior to transplantation in high tumor load cases'
