mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Seven out of ten OHS professionals work with alcohol-related cases less
  than monthly, with only one in ten doing so weekly'
- 'Step 2: Low frequency of intervention means the majority of employees who could
  benefit from alcohol prevention programs (1-3 out of 10 employees) do not receive
  services'
- 'Step 3: Unaddressed alcohol consumption continues to impact employee health and
  work performance'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative health burden increases across the workforce due to inadequate
  preventive service delivery'
