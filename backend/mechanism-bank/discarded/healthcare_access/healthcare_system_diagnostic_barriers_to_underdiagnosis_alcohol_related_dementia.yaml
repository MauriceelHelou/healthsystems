direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Despite being recognized since the 1960s, clinicians rarely use the alcohol-related
  dementia diagnosis'
- 'Step 2: Patient lack of truthfulness about alcohol consumption obscures diagnosis'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare systems lack structured protocols for obtaining collateral history
  from family/friends who can provide accurate alcohol use information'
- 'Step 4: Underdiagnosis leads to missed opportunities for thiamine treatment and
  abstinence support that could prevent or improve symptoms'
