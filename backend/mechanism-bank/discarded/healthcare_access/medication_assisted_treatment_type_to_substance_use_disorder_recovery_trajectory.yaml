mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different medication formulations (extended-release vs. oral, agonist vs.
  antagonist) have distinct pharmacological profiles affecting adherence and efficacy'
- 'Step 2: Structural factors including formulary inclusion, insurance coverage, and
  provider training determine which medications are accessible in specific geographic
  areas'
- 'Step 3: Communities with access to multiple medication options can match patients
  to optimal treatment based on clinical needs and preferences'
- 'Step 4: Availability of effective medication options improves composite recovery
  outcomes including abstinence, employment, and criminal justice involvement'
