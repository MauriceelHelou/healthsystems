direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation program increases organizational capacity to deliver alcohol
  screening and brief interventions systematically'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced screening rates identify more patients with problematic alcohol
  use who are eligible for brief intervention'
- 'Step 3: Provider training reduces barriers and increases skills for delivering
  brief interventions to screen-positive patients'
- 'Step 4: Combined effect of increased screening and maintained brief intervention
  delivery results in higher population-level coverage of evidence-based alcohol interventions'

  description: The substantial increase in screening activity (21.7% vs 0.16%) is
    a necessary precursor to population-based brief intervention delivery, creating
    a strong multiplicative effect
