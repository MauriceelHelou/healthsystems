  node_name: Chronic Hepatitis B Treatment Initiation Rate
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Asian individuals with chronic hepatitis B have the highest treatment initiation
  rate at 9.9 per 100 person-years'
- 'Step 2: This elevated rate may reflect higher disease burden, greater clinical
  severity, or more frequent hepatology specialty care access in this population'
- 'Step 3: Asian populations have higher prevalence of CHB and may receive more targeted
  screening and monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Among those meeting guideline criteria, treatment rates normalize to 62%
  across all groups, suggesting Asian individuals may be more likely to meet clinical
  thresholds for treatment'
