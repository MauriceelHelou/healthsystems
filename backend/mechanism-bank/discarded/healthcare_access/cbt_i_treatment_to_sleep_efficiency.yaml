category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CBT-I includes sleep restriction therapy component that consolidates time
  in bed'
- 'Step 2: Increased sleep drive from controlled sleep restriction improves sleep
  continuity'
- 'Step 3: Actigraphy objectively measures improved ratio of sleep time to time in
  bed'
- 'Step 4: Sleep efficiency improvements occur independent of cannabis use patterns
  during treatment'
