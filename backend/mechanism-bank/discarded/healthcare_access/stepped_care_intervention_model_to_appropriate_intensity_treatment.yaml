mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Full AUDIT assessment stratifies patients by severity (AUDIT 4-12 vs. >12)
  to match intervention intensity to need'
- 'Step 2: Lower-risk patients (AUDIT ≤12, 68.2% of assessed) receive social worker-delivered
  brief intervention via telephone'
- 'Step 3: Higher-risk patients (AUDIT >12, 31.8% of assessed) receive brief intervention
  plus offers of pharmacotherapy and/or addiction medicine referral'
- 'Step 4: 19 high-risk patients received pharmacotherapy and 13 had addiction medicine
  visits, providing specialized care for those with likely alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 5: Stepped approach efficiently allocates limited specialty resources while
  ensuring all identified patients receive evidence-based intervention'
