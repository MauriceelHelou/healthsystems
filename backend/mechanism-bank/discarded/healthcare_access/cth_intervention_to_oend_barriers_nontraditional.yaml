direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CTH intervention mobilizes community coalitions to expand harm reduction
  beyond traditional healthcare settings'
- 'Step 2: Coalition members identify and work to reduce barriers in non-traditional
  venues (e.g., community organizations, social service agencies, peer networks)'
- 'Step 3: Intervention activities address regulatory, financial, and stigma-related
  obstacles to naloxone distribution in community settings'
- 'Step 4: Perceived barriers to expanding naloxone access in non-traditional venues
  substantially decrease, improving coverage for marginalized populations with limited
  healthcare access'
