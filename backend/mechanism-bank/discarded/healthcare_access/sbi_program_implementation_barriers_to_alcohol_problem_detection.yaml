mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care physicians require quick, effective, reliable screening tools
  that don''t demand extra training, time, or complex recording procedures'
- 'Step 2: Implementation challenges at country level (Russia) include lack of validated
  Russian AUDIT, unclear operational definitions, and system-level barriers'
- 'Step 3: Without feasible screening tools, primary care providers cannot systematically
  identify individuals with potential or manifested alcohol problems'
- 'Step 4: Reduced early intervention capacity at accessible primary care level, pushing
  individuals toward late-stage specialized treatment or no treatment'
