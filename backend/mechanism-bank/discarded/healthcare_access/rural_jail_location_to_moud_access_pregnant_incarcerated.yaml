direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural jails have fewer healthcare resources and specialized addiction treatment
  staff compared to urban facilities'
- 'Step 2: Rural areas have limited availability of medical providers trained and
  licensed to prescribe methadone or buprenorphine'
- 'Step 3: Rural jails lack established partnerships with community MOUD providers
  for consultation and medication delivery'
- 'Step 4: Pregnant incarcerated persons in rural jails are denied evidence-based
  OUD treatment, increasing risk of withdrawal, pregnancy complications, and treatment
  discontinuity'
