direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elective surgical patients are rarely offered alcohol-focused education,
  interventions, or treatment in standard care protocols'
- 'Step 2: Without systematic screening and intervention, patients continue high-risk
  alcohol consumption patterns undetected'
- 'Step 3: Absence of preoperative identification prevents implementation of risk-reduction
  strategies during critical perioperative period'
- 'Step 4: High-risk alcohol use persists through surgical period, increasing postoperative
  complications and poor recovery outcomes'
