mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Web-based intervention provides accessible personalized feedback on alcohol
  use without requiring in-person services'
- 'Step 2: Students receive normative information correcting misperceptions about
  peer drinking and education about risks'
- 'Step 3: Personalized feedback increases awareness of personal drinking patterns
  and associated risks'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness and corrected norms lead to reduced alcohol consumption
  in the general college population'
