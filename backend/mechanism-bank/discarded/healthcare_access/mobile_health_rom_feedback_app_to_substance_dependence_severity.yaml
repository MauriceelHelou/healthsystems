mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile health app provides accessible platform for routine outcome monitoring
  within mutual support group context'
- 'Step 2: App enables real-time personal feedback data through Urges screen and Overall
  Progress screen, enhancing self-awareness of substance use patterns'
- 'Step 3: Integration with SMART Recovery mutual support groups creates structured
  accountability and reinforcement of evidence-based behavioral strategies'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement with ROM data (58% used app >5 weeks) supports continued
  self-monitoring and reduces severity of dependence'
