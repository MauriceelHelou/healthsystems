category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Immediate appointment scheduling within 2 days eliminates waiting periods
  that allow relapse or loss of motivation during transition from withdrawal management
  to ongoing treatment'
- 'Step 2: Accompaniment to first appointment removes logistical barriers (transportation,
  navigation of unfamiliar healthcare settings) that disproportionately affect patients
  lacking stable housing or resources'
- 'Step 3: Structured referral pathway reduces administrative burden on patients who
  are in acute recovery and may have cognitive impairments from substance use'
- 'Step 4: Rapid access capitalizes on moment of readiness to change that occurs during
  withdrawal management, preventing attrition during critical transition period'
