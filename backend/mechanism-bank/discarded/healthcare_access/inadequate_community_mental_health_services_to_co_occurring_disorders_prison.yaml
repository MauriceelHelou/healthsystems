- 'Step 1: Insufficient community treatment capacity for complex co-occurring disorders
  leaves people without adequate care'
- 'Step 2: Untreated co-occurring disorders lead to survival strategies including
  substance use and behaviors that increase criminal justice involvement'
- 'Step 3: Lack of integrated treatment models in community settings means people
  cycle between crisis and inadequate care'
- 'Step 4: Criminal justice system becomes default institution for managing people
  with complex clinical profiles who cannot access appropriate community services'
