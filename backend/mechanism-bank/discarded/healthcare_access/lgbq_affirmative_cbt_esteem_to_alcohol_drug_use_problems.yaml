mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ESTEEM intervention targets minority stress processes that drive substance
  use as a coping mechanism'
- 'Step 2: Structural stigma and discrimination create chronic stress for sexual minority
  men, particularly those also experiencing racism'
- 'Step 3: Treatment provides alternative coping strategies and reduces internalized
  stigma that contributes to substance use'
- 'Step 4: Black and Latino sexual minority men face heightened minority stress from
  intersecting racial and sexual stigma, making them more likely to use substances
  to cope'
- 'Step 5: Addressing these structural stressors leads to greater reductions in alcohol
  and drug problems among racially/ethnically minoritized participants'
