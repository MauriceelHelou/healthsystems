mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incarceration removes pregnant persons from community-based addiction treatment
  settings where MOUD is available'
- 'Step 2: Jail systems operate under security-focused policies that create barriers
  to bringing controlled medications into facilities'
- 'Step 3: Correctional administrators lack training and institutional policies supporting
  evidence-based addiction treatment'
- 'Step 4: Pregnant incarcerated persons face serious barriers accessing MOUD despite
  clinical guidelines recommending continuation of treatment'
