mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with cirrhosis and documented substance use disorders experience
  ongoing substance use that may not be adequately treated'
- 'Step 2: Continued substance use (particularly alcohol) leads to progressive liver
  damage and decompensation events'
- 'Step 3: Only 35% of patients with clinically-recognized SUD establish addiction
  treatment despite 65% receiving referrals, creating a treatment gap'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or inadequately treated SUD results in cirrhosis complications
  requiring repeated hospitalizations'
