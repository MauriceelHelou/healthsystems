direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized intake assessment (MATE) provides objective measurement of
  patient needs across multiple domains'
- 'Step 2: Guidelines generate specific recommendations for aftercare level intensity
  based on assessment data'
- 'Step 3: Within structured inpatient settings, staff can apply guidelines with moderate
  to substantial agreement (kappa ≥0.41)'
- 'Step 4: However, consistency decreases substantially after discharge due to external
  system factors and resource constraints'
