mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems without routine electroneurophysiological testing protocols
  fail to detect subclinical neuropathy in 33.4% of affected patients'
- 'Step 2: Undetected subclinical nerve damage progresses with continued oxaliplatin
  exposure through additional treatment cycles'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative neurotoxic effects transition from reversible acute changes
  to chronic irreversible peripheral nerve damage'
- 'Step 4: Delayed recognition prevents timely treatment adjustment, resulting in
  preventable permanent sensory and motor dysfunction'
