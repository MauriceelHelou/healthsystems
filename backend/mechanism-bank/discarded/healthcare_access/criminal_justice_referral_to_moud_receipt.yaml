mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice agencies operate within systems that historically prioritize
  abstinence-based treatment models and may have institutional barriers to medication-assisted
  treatment'
- 'Step 2: Criminal justice-referred individuals face stigma and discrimination in
  healthcare settings due to their involvement with the legal system'
- 'Step 3: Treatment facilities serving criminal justice populations may have limited
  capacity or authorization to prescribe controlled substances like buprenorphine
  or methadone'
- 'Step 4: Lack of integration between criminal justice and healthcare systems creates
  administrative and logistical barriers to accessing medications for OUD'
