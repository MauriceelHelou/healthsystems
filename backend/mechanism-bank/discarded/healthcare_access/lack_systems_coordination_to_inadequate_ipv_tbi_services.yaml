direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare, social services, legal systems, and community organizations
  operate independently without coordination mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Absence of systems-level support and funding for integration prevents development
  of coordinated care pathways'
- 'Step 3: Women survivors must navigate multiple disconnected systems simultaneously
  while managing trauma and injury'
- 'Step 4: Lack of coordinated response results in gaps in identification, treatment,
  safety planning, and long-term support for complex needs'
