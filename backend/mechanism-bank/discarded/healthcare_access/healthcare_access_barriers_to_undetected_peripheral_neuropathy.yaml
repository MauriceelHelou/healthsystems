category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neurophysiological confirmation of peripheral nerve damage is costly and
  sometimes involves invasive procedures'
- 'Step 2: Cost and invasiveness create barriers to accessing neurophysiological testing
  in resource-limited settings'
- 'Step 3: Without access to gold-standard testing, peripheral neuropathy in patients
  with AUD may remain undetected'
- 'Step 4: Clinical scales can serve as accessible alternatives but are underutilized
  when neurophysiological testing is unavailable'
