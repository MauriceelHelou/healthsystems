direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater geographic distance creates physical barriers to reaching buprenorphine
  treatment facilities'
- 'Step 2: Increased travel burden (time, cost, transportation requirements) reduces
  feasibility of initiating and maintaining treatment'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) leads to untreated
  opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Untreated opioid use disorder increases risk of overdose and mortality'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Positive correlation between state's percentage rurality and percentage
    outside distance buffers (r = .491, p < .000), indicating rural areas have substantially
    worse geographic access
- name: baseline_treatment_need
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Access is lower in areas of higher need, creating inverse care law
    where populations most requiring treatment have worst geographic access
