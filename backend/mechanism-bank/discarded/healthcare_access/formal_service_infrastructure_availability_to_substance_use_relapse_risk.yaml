mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited formal service infrastructure in small towns forces youth experiencing
  housing instability to rely primarily on informal family supports'
- 'Step 2: Family support networks may include members with active substance use,
  creating environments with high drug availability and use'
- 'Step 3: Youth must choose between having a place to stay (family home with substance
  use) versus maintaining sobriety'
- 'Step 4: Competing needs for housing security versus recovery support increase relapse
  risk for youth with current or prior addictions'
