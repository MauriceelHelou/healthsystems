mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OPRM1 genotype testing identifies patients carrying G-allele variant (c.118A>G)
  who have differential pharmacological response to naltrexone'
- 'Step 2: G-allele carriers are preferentially allocated to naltrexone therapy, while
  AA homozygotes receive acamprosate or naltrexone'
- 'Step 3: Genotype-matched treatment allocation improves pharmacological effectiveness
  through optimized opioid receptor interaction in G-allele carriers'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced medication response reduces relapse rates and improves treatment
  outcomes for alcohol use disorders'
