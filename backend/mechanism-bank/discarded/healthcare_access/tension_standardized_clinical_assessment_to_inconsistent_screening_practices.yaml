direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Health professionals experience tension between using standardized screening
  tools versus clinical judgment for alcohol risk assessment'
- 'Step 2: This tension creates ambiguity about when and how to screen patients for
  harmful alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Providers inconsistently apply screening protocols, with some patients
  screened and others not based on subjective clinical impression'
- 'Step 4: Inconsistent screening leads to missed identification of at-risk patients
  who could benefit from early intervention'
