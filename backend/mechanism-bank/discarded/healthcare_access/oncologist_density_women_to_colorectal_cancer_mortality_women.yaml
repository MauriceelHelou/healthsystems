direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographic concentration of oncologists in certain Brazilian Federal Units
  creates referral centers'
- 'Step 2: Women with advanced colorectal cancer travel or are referred from areas
  lacking specialized care'
- 'Step 3: Concentration of late-stage patients in areas with high oncologist density
  increases mortality rates in those regions'
- 'Step 4: This pattern reflects healthcare access inequity rather than negative effects
  of oncologist availability'
