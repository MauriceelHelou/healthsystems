- 'Step 1: Validated AOD screening tools identify adolescents with substance use risk
  among admitted trauma patients'
- 'Step 2: Positive screening results trigger clinical protocols for brief intervention
  delivery'
- 'Step 3: Trained trauma center staff deliver structured brief interventions to identified
  adolescents while admitted'
