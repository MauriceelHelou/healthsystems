direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oral medications (disulfiram, acamprosate, oral naltrexone) require daily
  or multiple daily self-administration'
- 'Step 2: Daily dosing depends on consistent pharmacy access, prescription refills,
  and patient-managed medication routines'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare system structures provide minimal supervision or adherence support
  for oral formulations compared to injectable medications'
- 'Step 4: Only 11.9-22.7% of oral medication courses achieve 80% adherence threshold,
  limiting treatment effectiveness'
