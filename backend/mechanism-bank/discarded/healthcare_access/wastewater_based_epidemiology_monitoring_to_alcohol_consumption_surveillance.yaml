mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) infrastructure enables
  detection of alcohol metabolites (ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate) in sewage
  samples'
- 'Step 2: UPLC-MS/MS analytical methods allow quantification of these metabolites
  with high sensitivity (LLOQ 0.1 μg/L) and accuracy (>97% recovery)'
- 'Step 3: Systematic collection from 31 provincial capital cities'' wastewater treatment
  plants provides representative population-level alcohol consumption estimates'
- 'Step 4: WBE-derived estimates (6.09 ± 4.56 g ethanol/person/day) enable objective,
  real-time monitoring of alcohol consumption patterns across geographic regions'
