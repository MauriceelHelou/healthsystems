direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Without standardized tools, family history collection in primary care remains
  inconsistent and unsystematic'
- 'Step 2: Non-standardized approaches lead to incomplete or inaccurate capture of
  genetically relevant information'
- 'Step 3: Incomplete genetic risk information prevents identification of high-risk
  individuals who would benefit from early intervention'
- 'Step 4: Missed opportunities for pre-symptomatic detection result in later disease
  diagnosis and reduced treatment effectiveness'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Standardized questionnaires that can be integrated into electronic
    health records with consistent, accessible locations enable more systematic capture
    and use of family history information
- name: gp_clinical_experience
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: More experienced GPs may partially compensate for lack of standardized
    tools through clinical expertise, though this creates inconsistency across providers
