mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smartphone-based gait analysis using BiCNN models passively detects when
  users exceed legal driving limit (0.08 BAC) with 83.5% accuracy'
- 'Step 2: Just-In-Time alerts notify potentially intoxicated individuals before they
  attempt to drive'
- 'Step 3: Early detection and intervention prevents individuals over legal BAC limit
  from driving'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in DUI incidents leads to fewer alcohol-related traffic injuries
  and fatalities (currently >800 per day)'
