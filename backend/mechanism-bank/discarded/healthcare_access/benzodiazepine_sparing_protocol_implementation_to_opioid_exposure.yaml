mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Protocol implementation focuses on alcohol withdrawal management medications
  but does not directly target pain management strategies'
- 'Step 2: Both conventional and benzodiazepine-sparing groups received similar pain
  management approaches for trauma-related injuries'
- 'Step 3: Mean morphine milligram equivalents per day remained statistically unchanged
  between groups (31.5 vs 33.6, p=0.49)'
- 'Step 4: Protocol demonstrates specificity to withdrawal management without unintended
  effects on necessary pain control'
