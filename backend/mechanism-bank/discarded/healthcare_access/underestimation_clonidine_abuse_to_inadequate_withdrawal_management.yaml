mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare providers underestimate clonidine abuse potential and treat
  it as low-risk medication'
- 'Step 2: Insufficient attention to clonidine abuse leads to inadequate monitoring
  protocols during withdrawal management'
- 'Step 3: Lack of recognition of clonidine abuse patterns delays identification and
  intervention'
- 'Step 4: Patients experiencing clonidine withdrawal alongside opioid use disorder
  may not receive appropriate comprehensive management'
