mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional selection criteria (e.g., Milan Criteria) use only tumor morphology
  without incorporating biological characteristics of tumors'
- 'Step 2: Patients with tumors outside morphological criteria are automatically excluded
  from transplant candidacy regardless of favorable tumor biology'
- 'Step 3: 24.4% of patients in this cohort did not meet Milan Criteria and would
  be denied transplant access'
- 'Step 4: Among those excluded, 83.1% (453/545) could be recategorized as low- or
  acceptable-risk with >75% 5-year recurrence-free survival when biological markers
  are considered'
