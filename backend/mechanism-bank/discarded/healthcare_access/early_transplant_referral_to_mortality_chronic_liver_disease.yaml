mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Providers recognize clinical indication for transplant evaluation (decompensation
  or MELD-Na ≥15) and make timely referral within 3 months'
- 'Step 2: Early evaluation allows assessment before significant disease progression
  and medical complications'
- 'Step 3: Patients can be listed for transplant at earlier disease stages with better
  candidacy profiles'
- 'Step 4: Earlier listing increases likelihood of receiving transplant before disease
  progression to death'
