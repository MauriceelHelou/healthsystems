- 'Step 1: Psychiatric intervention provides pharmacological and therapeutic management
  of alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Effective treatment reduces frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Decreased cumulative alcohol exposure reduces chronic hepatocyte injury

  progression'
- 'Step 5: Decreased fibrosis advancement reduces incidence of cirrhosis development'
