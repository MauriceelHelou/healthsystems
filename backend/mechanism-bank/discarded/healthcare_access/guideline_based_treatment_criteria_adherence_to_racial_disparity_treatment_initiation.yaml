direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized clinical guidelines provide objective criteria for initiating
  chronic hepatitis B treatment based on viral load, liver function, and disease severity'
- 'Step 2: When healthcare systems systematically apply these guidelines across all
  patient populations, subjective clinical decision-making that may be influenced
  by implicit bias is reduced'
- 'Step 3: The study found that among patients meeting guideline-based criteria, 62%
  received treatment initiation regardless of race'
- 'Step 4: This elimination of racial disparity when guidelines are followed demonstrates
  that structural barriers exist in the consistent application of guidelines rather
  than in treatment access once criteria are met'
