direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nursing home facilities in rural areas close due to economic or regulatory
  pressures'
- 'Step 2: Closure eliminates the local provider of post-acute care services in the
  ZIP code'
- 'Step 3: Residents must travel to next nearest facility to access PAC services'
- 'Step 4: Geographic distance to closest PAC provider increases substantially'
