direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Torasemide triggers vasculitic response in patient with underlying EGPA
  predisposition and pANCA positivity'
- 'Step 2: Necrotizing inflammation of small and medium vessels extends to vasa nervorum
  (blood vessels supplying peripheral nerves)'
- 'Step 3: Ischemic nerve damage occurs due to vasculitic compromise of nerve blood
  supply'
- 'Step 4: Electromyography demonstrates loss of sural nerve response bilaterally
  and slowed conduction velocity in tibial and peroneal nerves, manifesting as lower
  limb paresthesia, pain, and weakness'

  description: pANCA-positive EGPA patients (40-60% of cases) have significantly higher
    rates of neuropathy compared to seronegative patients. This patient's elevated
    anti-MPO antibodies (1:160) strongly predispose to nerve involvement

  description: 74-year-old patient may have reduced vascular reserve and pre-existing
    microvascular changes that increase vulnerability to ischemic nerve injury
