direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patient initially admitted to emergency care with suspected postconcussive
  syndrome, alcohol-related thiamine deficiency, and TAON'
- 'Step 2: Acute treatment with thiamine, cobalamin, and folate substitution improved
  TAON but major cognitive deficits remained'
- 'Step 3: 4-month delay before admission to specialized neurorehabilitation center
  during which deficits persisted without targeted intervention'
- 'Step 4: At neurorehabilitation admission, patient was fully reliant on care staff
  for all ADL, suggesting potential worsening or lack of improvement during delay
  period'
- 'Step 5: Extended delay may have allowed maladaptive patterns to consolidate, potentially
  requiring longer rehabilitation duration (26 months)'
