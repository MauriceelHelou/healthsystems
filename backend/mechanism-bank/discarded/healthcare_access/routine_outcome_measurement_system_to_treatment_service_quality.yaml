- 'Step 1: ROM systems (NADAbase) enable systematic collection of standardized outcome
  data across treatment services'
- 'Step 2: Establishment of effectiveness indicators provides benchmarking standards
  for service evaluation'
- 'Step 3: Services can compare performance against benchmarks to identify quality
  improvement opportunities'
- 'Step 4: Data-driven quality assurance practices enhance treatment effectiveness
  and service delivery models'
