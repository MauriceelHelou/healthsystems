- 'Step 1: Harm reduction treatment for homeless populations explicitly incorporates
  goal-setting around meeting basic needs (food, shelter, safety)'
- 'Step 2: Addressing basic needs is prioritized by participants as second-highest
  goal category, reflecting structural deprivation experienced during homelessness'
- 'Step 3: Clinical support for achieving basic needs goals connects individuals to
  resources and reduces material hardship'
- 'Step 4: Meeting fundamental survival needs creates foundation for improved overall
  quality of life and capacity to address other health concerns'
