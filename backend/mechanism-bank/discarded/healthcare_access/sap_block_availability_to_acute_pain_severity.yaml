mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency department implementation of SAP block as pain management intervention
  provides regional anesthesia option for chest trauma patients'
- 'Step 2: SAP block performed by emergency physicians delivers local anesthetic to
  serratus anterior plane, blocking intercostal nerve transmission'
- 'Step 3: Nerve blockade reduces nociceptive signaling from fractured ribs to central
  nervous system'
- 'Step 4: Reduced pain severity measured at 3, 6, and 18 hours post-intervention
  compared to standard therapy alone'
