direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of systematic screening protocols allows clinician discretion in
  determining who receives screening'
- 'Step 2: Implicit biases influence clinician perceptions of which patients are at
  risk for alcohol problems'
- 'Step 3: Black patients and uninsured patients are disproportionately excluded from
  screening opportunities'
- 'Step 4: Screening gaps prevent early intervention access for marginalized populations,
  perpetuating health inequities'
