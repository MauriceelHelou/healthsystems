direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional drug and alcohol treatment services lack cultural competency
  and understanding of British South Asian and Muslim community needs'
- 'Step 2: Service design and delivery does not account for cultural sensitivities,
  religious considerations, or community-specific barriers'
- 'Step 3: Community members perceive services as unwelcoming or inappropriate for
  their cultural context'
- 'Step 4: Low perceived accessibility and cultural mismatch results in minimal engagement
  from BSA and Muslim populations'
