direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic deprivation creates chronic stress, limited economic opportunities,
  and restricted access to health-promoting resources'
- 'Step 2: Deprived areas have fewer mental health services, substance use treatment
  facilities, and preventive healthcare access'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers to care result in untreated or under-treated alcohol
  use disorder and mental health conditions'
- 'Step 4: Lack of integrated, holistic healthcare in deprived areas allows clustering
  of AUD, mental health conditions, and chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes'
