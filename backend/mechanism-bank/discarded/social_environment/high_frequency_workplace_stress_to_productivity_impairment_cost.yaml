direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workplace conditions in mining industry create environments where employees
  experience stress most or all of the time, indicating chronic occupational stressor
  exposure'
- 'Step 2: Persistent workplace stress activates prolonged physiological stress responses
  affecting cognitive and physical functioning'
- 'Step 3: Sustained stress impairs work capacity, decision-making, attention, and
  task completion abilities'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative performance deficits result in productivity impairment costs
  exceeding $50,000 annually per affected employee'
