  trauma disproportionately affecting women'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to intimate partner violence creates psychological distress including
  anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress'
- 'Step 3: Mental health symptoms and trauma responses may lead to self-medication
  through alcohol use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders manifest in DUI
  arrests, with women showing higher mental health burden'
