  node_id: population_alcohol_exposure
  node_name: Population-Level Alcohol Exposure
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Global alcohol industry expansion and marketing increases availability
  and normalization of alcohol consumption worldwide'
- 'Step 2: Rising per capita alcohol consumption reflects increased frequency and
  quantity of alcohol use across populations'
- 'Step 3: Greater population exposure to alcohol increases the number of individuals
  at risk for alcoholic liver disease'
- 'Step 4: Among those with metabolic trait vulnerabilities, increased exposure translates
  to higher absolute numbers experiencing severe hepatotoxic effects'
