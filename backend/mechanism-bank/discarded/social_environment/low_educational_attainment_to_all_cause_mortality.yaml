mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower educational attainment limits access to stable employment and income,
  reducing resources for health-promoting behaviors and environments'
- 'Step 2: Educational inequality creates differential exposure to health risk factors
  including smoking and harmful alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers maintain social inequality in mortality through limited
  access to healthcare and preventive services'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative disadvantage across the life course leads to increased mortality
  risk among those with lower educational attainment'
