mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness requires presence in public spaces where physical altercations
  and assaults are more common'
- 'Step 2: Lack of private space increases exposure to interpersonal conflicts that
  escalate to physical violence'
- 'Step 3: Limited ability to retreat to safe housing after conflicts increases vulnerability
  to repeated physical assaults'
- 'Step 4: Structural vulnerability and marginalization increase exposure to violence
  from multiple sources including community members and institutions'
