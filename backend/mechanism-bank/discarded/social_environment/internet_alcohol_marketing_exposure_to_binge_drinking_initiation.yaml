  node_id: binge_drinking_initiation
  node_name: Binge Drinking Initiation in Youth
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth are exposed to alcohol advertising on internet platforms, creating
  repeated exposure to alcohol brand messaging and normalization of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Marketing content increases brand awareness, creates positive associations
  with alcohol products, and normalizes underage drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced receptivity to marketing messages reduces perceived risk of alcohol
  consumption and increases intentions to drink'
- 'Step 4: Youth initiate or escalate to binge drinking patterns (≥6 drinks per occasion)
  as a result of normalized alcohol consumption behaviors promoted through marketing'
