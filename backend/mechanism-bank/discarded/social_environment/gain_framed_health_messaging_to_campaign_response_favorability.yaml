direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public health campaigns deploy gain-framed messages emphasizing positive
  outcomes of responsible drinking'
- 'Step 2: In environments with unhealthy peer drinking norms, gain-framed messages
  activate deviance regulation processes'
- 'Step 3: Students exposed to gain-framed messages are motivated to distance themselves
  from perceived unhealthy peer behaviors'
- 'Step 4: This results in more favorable cognitive and attitudinal responses to responsible
  drinking campaign messages'

  description: Gain-framed messaging is especially effective among students who perceive
    that most peers use alcohol irresponsibly. The presence of unhealthy norms amplifies
    the effectiveness of gain-framed appeals.

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher levels of individual alcohol consumption reduce the effectiveness
    of gain-framed messaging on behavioral intentions, though campaign responses may
    still be favorable.
