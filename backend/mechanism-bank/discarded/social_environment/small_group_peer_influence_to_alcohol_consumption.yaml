direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students interact in small peer groups during social drinking events
  rather than large crowds'
- 'Step 2: Within these intimate group settings, peer behaviors and expectations become
  highly salient and create immediate social pressure'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their drinking behavior in real-time based on the observed
  and perceived norms of their immediate small group'
- 'Step 4: Repeated small group interactions reinforce drinking patterns and establish
  group-specific norms that may exceed perceived campus-wide norms'
