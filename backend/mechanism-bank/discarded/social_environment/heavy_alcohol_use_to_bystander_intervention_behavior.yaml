direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy drinking students more frequently attend social situations and environments
  where sexual violence risk is elevated (parties, bars, social gatherings)'
- 'Step 2: Greater exposure to high-risk social contexts increases opportunities to
  observe situations requiring bystander intervention'
- 'Step 3: Students in alcohol-involved social settings may encounter more instances
  where peers need assistance or intervention'
- 'Step 4: Increased opportunity for observation and intervention translates to higher
  reported rates of actual bystander behaviors among heavy drinkers'

  description: Heavy drinking students were more likely to report engaging in bystander
    behaviors across time compared to non-heavy drinking students, suggesting drinking
    patterns moderate the relationship between program exposure and behavioral outcomes
