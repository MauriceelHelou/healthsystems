- 'Step 1: Stigma creates social and internalized shame associated with seeking help
  for alcohol problems'
- 'Step 2: Fear of judgment and discrimination deters individuals from acknowledging
  alcohol problems and seeking treatment'

  traditional treatment services'
- 'Step 4: Low treatment uptake results in untreated alcohol use disorders despite
  high severity of problems'
