direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sexual abuse in childhood creates profound trauma, violating bodily autonomy
  and disrupting development of healthy boundaries'
- 'Step 2: Trauma responses including dissociation, self-blame, and altered threat
  perception affect ability to recognize and respond to dangerous relationship dynamics'
- 'Step 3: Lack of trauma-informed support services leaves survivors without tools
  to process abuse and develop protective relationship skills'
- 'Step 4: Societal victim-blaming and inadequate prosecution of sexual abuse perpetrators
  compounds trauma and increases vulnerability to revictimization in adult relationships'
