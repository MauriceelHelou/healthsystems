mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universities create diverse social contexts where alcohol consumption occurs
  (e.g., wine nights, bro-dinners, jungle juice events)'
- 'Step 2: Different social practices create varied motivations and opportunities
  for alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Students engage in binge drinking within these structurally-enabled social
  contexts'
- 'Step 4: Traditional interventions fail by treating binge drinking as unified behavior
  rather than addressing specific social practices'
