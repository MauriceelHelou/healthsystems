mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students perceive what they believe to be typical drinking patterns among
  their peers'
- 'Step 2: These perceived norms establish social reference points that influence
  individual drinking expectations'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own drinking frequency to align with what they perceive
  as normative behavior'
- 'Step 4: Higher perceived peer drinking norms lead to increased individual drinking
  frequency across both cohorts'

    consumption, suggesting norms remained influential even when actual exposure to
    peer drinking was limited
