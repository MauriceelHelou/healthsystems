mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural areas present unique contextual features including geographic isolation,
  limited economic opportunities, and reduced service access'
- 'Step 2: Community factors such as social norms around alcohol use, availability
  of substances, and limited youth activities shape exposure opportunities'
- 'Step 3: Youth in rural areas experience particular vulnerability to community-level
  risk factors due to limited alternative resources and activities'
- 'Step 4: Combined contextual pressures contribute to earlier alcohol use initiation
  among rural youth compared to urban counterparts'
