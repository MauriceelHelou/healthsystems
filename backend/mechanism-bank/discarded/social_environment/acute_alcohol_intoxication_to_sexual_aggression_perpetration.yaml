direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption reduces cognitive inhibition and impairs decision-making
  processes'
- 'Step 2: Intoxication narrows attention to immediate situational cues while reducing
  consideration of long-term consequences or social norms against aggression'
- 'Step 3: In men with pre-existing vulnerability (high MGRS), alcohol intoxication
  removes protective inhibitory processes'
- 'Step 4: When perceiving that a woman is also intoxicated, alcohol-related cognitive
  impairment combines with situational factors to facilitate sexual aggression'
