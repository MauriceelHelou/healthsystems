mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use is concentrated in areas with limited economic opportunities,
  social disorder, and weak community institutions'
- 'Step 2: Intoxication increases vulnerability to victimization through impaired
  situational awareness and ability to avoid danger'
- 'Step 3: Substance use contexts overlap with high-violence environments including
  drug markets and establishments where conflicts escalate'
- 'Step 4: Both perpetrators and victims often have substance involvement, creating
  mutual escalation dynamics leading to injury'
