mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Household contacts (HHCs) of Hansen''s disease (HD) patients have 5-10
  times higher risk of HD infection than general population due to close proximity
  and prolonged exposure to Mycobacterium leprae'
- 'Step 2: Mycobacterium leprae preferentially infects Schwann cells in peripheral
  nerves, causing nerve inflammation and damage'
- 'Step 3: Silent (subclinical) peripheral neuropathy develops with nerve thickening
  and increased cross-sectional area detectable by high-resolution ultrasound before
  clinical symptoms appear'
- 'Step 4: Progressive nerve damage leads to asymmetric multiple mononeuropathy pattern
  characteristic of HD neuropathy'
