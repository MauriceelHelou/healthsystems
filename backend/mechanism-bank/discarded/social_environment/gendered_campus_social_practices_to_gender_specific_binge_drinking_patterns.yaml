direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus social structures create and reinforce gendered social practices
  (e.g., ''bro-dinners'' for men, ''wine nights'' for women)'
- 'Step 2: These gendered contexts establish different norms, expectations, and motivations
  for alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Students participate in gender-specific drinking practices that reflect
  broader campus gender dynamics'
- 'Step 4: Binge drinking manifests differently across gender-segregated or gender-specific
  social contexts'
