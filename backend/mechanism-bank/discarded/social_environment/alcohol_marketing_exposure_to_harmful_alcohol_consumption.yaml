- 'Step 1: Inadequate marketing regulations allow widespread exposure to alcohol advertising
  and promotion across multiple channels'
- 'Step 2: Marketing exposure normalizes alcohol consumption and shapes social norms

  drinking, especially among youth and vulnerable populations'
- 'Step 4: This leads to increased harmful drinking patterns at population level'
