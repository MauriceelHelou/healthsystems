mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Environments that promote wellbeing and positive emotions reduce chronic
  stress responses in animals'
- 'Step 2: Reduced stress leads to improved immune system functioning through neuroimmune
  pathways'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced immune function reduces susceptibility to infection and disease
  onset'
- 'Step 4: Animals experience milder disease symptoms when infection does occur'
