direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol advertisements function as reward-predictive cues that activate
  prefrontal-reward circuitry in the adolescent brain'
- 'Step 2: During adolescence, a sensitive developmental window characterized by heightened
  susceptibility to social and reward cues, these advertisements establish positive
  associations with alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Sensitization of prefrontal-reward circuitry reinforces alcohol consumption
  upon exposure and motivates social drinking behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological changes from repeated exposure contribute to patterns of
  alcohol use and potential later abuse'
