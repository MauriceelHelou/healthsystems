  problems'
- 'Step 2: Young men fear judgment and negative social consequences of disclosing
  gambling issues'
- 'Step 3: Stigma acts as a barrier to seeking formal help or discussing problems
  with peers and family'
- 'Step 4: Without help-seeking, gambling harms escalate and treatment opportunities
