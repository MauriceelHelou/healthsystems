direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Population-level increases in alcohol use disorder prevalence expose more
  individuals to chronic heavy alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes direct hepatotoxic injury through acetaldehyde
  accumulation and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Sustained alcohol-induced liver injury progresses through stages: steatosis,
  alcoholic hepatitis, and fibrosis/cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: Increased population exposure to heavy alcohol use translates to higher
  incidence of alcohol-associated liver disease at the population level'
