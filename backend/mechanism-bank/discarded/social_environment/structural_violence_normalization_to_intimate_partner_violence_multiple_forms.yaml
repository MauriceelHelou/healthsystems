direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical structural violence (apartheid policies, economic marginalization)
  creates sedimented patterns of violence'
- 'Step 2: Violence within homes becomes ''normalized'' as a disaster that persists
  across generations'
- 'Step 3: Normalization reduces community and institutional responses to IPV'
- 'Step 4: Multiple manifestations of IPV (physical, emotional, sexual) become entrenched
  within domestic relationships'
- 'Step 5: Women develop coping mechanisms to manage rather than escape harmful relationships'
