mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals observe patterns of addiction across family members over time'
- 'Step 2: Cultural narratives and treatment program messaging frame addiction as
  having genetic components'
- 'Step 3: Personal family history experiences become interpreted through genetic
  lens'
- 'Step 4: Individuals construct understanding that addiction ''runs in families''
  through genetic transmission'
