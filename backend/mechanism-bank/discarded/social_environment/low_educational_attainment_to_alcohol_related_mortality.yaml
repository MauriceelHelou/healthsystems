mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower educational attainment is associated with increased exposure to chronic
  stress, job insecurity, and economic hardship'
- 'Step 2: Structural disadvantage limits access to healthy coping mechanisms and
  mental health services, increasing reliance on alcohol as a stress response'
- 'Step 3: Lower-educated communities experience higher density of alcohol outlets
  and alcohol marketing, increasing availability and normalization of harmful consumption'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to treatment services for alcohol use disorders among disadvantaged
  groups allows progression to alcohol-related diseases and mortality'
