direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Internet platforms provide unregulated spaces for alcohol advertising that
  reach adolescents who have already initiated drinking in childhood'
- 'Step 2: Web-based alcohol advertisements use interactive and personalized marketing
  techniques that reinforce continued alcohol use among youth experimenters'
- 'Step 3: Digital marketing creates repeated exposure and engagement opportunities
  that are less monitored than traditional media channels'
- 'Step 4: Among youth who have already initiated drinking, web advertising escalates
  occasional drinking patterns by normalizing regular consumption and presenting aspirational
  drinking scenarios'

  description: Website advertising effects are specific to adolescents who have already
    initiated alcohol use in childhood. This channel does not significantly affect
    drinking initiation but rather escalation of existing drinking patterns.
