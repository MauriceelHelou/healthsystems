mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black residents are concentrated in neighborhoods shaped by historical
  redlining, disinvestment, and structural racism in housing and labor markets'
- 'Step 2: These structural conditions create multiple vulnerabilities including overcrowded
  housing, essential worker employment without protections, and limited economic resources
  for pandemic mitigation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to structural racism produces weathering effects and higher
  rates of comorbid conditions that increase COVID-19 severity risk'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system barriers including under-resourced local facilities,
  discrimination in care delivery, and lack of insurance increase mortality once infected'
