mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhood social environments with limited economic opportunities concentrate
  networks of individuals with substance use'
- 'Step 2: Continued affiliation with heavy drinkers provides social modeling of drinking
  behaviors and normalization of alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Social network structure creates opportunities and social pressure for
  alcohol consumption during social interactions'
- 'Step 4: Network-level drinking patterns undermine individual recovery efforts and
  increase relapse probability'
