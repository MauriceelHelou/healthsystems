direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates multiple simultaneous stressors across six domains:
  personal/family infection, healthcare access barriers, economic hardship, health
  deterioration, social isolation, and home conflicts'
- 'Step 2: Universal exposure to pandemic stressors (all 150 participants reported
  at least one negatively impacted domain) creates sustained environmental stress
  during critical treatment period'
- 'Step 3: Compounded structural barriers and stressors overwhelm individual and community
  coping resources'
- 'Step 4: Multiple simultaneous structural stressors increase vulnerability to substance
  use and impede recovery among patients receiving buprenorphine treatment for OUD'
