- 'Step 1: Oppressive social circumstances constrain identity development and limit
  opportunities for life-course transitions'
- 'Step 2: These constraints create and maintain contexts that support problematic
  alcohol use as a coping mechanism'

  and emancipation'
- 'Step 4: Identity development associated with major life-curve changes facilitates
  alcohol problem resolution'
