direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood exposure to father perpetrating violence against mother triggers
  repetitive distress and fear responses'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress exposure affects neurodevelopmental processes and mental
  health functioning in both short and long term'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted neurodevelopment and compromised mental health create increased
  vulnerability to substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Maladaptive stress responses and mental health sequelae manifest as alcohol
  abuse in adulthood'
