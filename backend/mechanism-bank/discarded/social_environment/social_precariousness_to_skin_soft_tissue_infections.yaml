mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social precariousness creates conditions of material deprivation and reduced
  access to basic hygiene infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Lack of access to clean water, soap, and sanitation facilities limits ability
  to maintain hand hygiene before drug injection'
- 'Step 3: Poor hand hygiene during injection practices introduces bacteria and pathogens
  into injection sites'
- 'Step 4: Bacterial introduction leads to development of abscesses and other skin
  and soft tissue infections'
