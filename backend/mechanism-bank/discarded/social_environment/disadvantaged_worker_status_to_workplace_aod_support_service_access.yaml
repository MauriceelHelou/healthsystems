mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural disadvantage (gender, ethnicity, language barriers) concentrates
  workers in lower-tier employment sectors with fewer benefits'
- 'Step 2: Industries and organizations employing disadvantaged workers invest less
  in comprehensive employee assistance programs and counseling services'
- 'Step 3: Limited English proficiency creates additional barriers to accessing available
  services even when present'
- 'Step 4: Disadvantaged workers experience reduced access to workplace support services
  for substance use problems despite similar or greater need'
