mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predispositions influence selection into or exposure to enriched
  educational and cultural environments through gene-environment correlation'
- 'Step 2: These environments provide differential access to vocabulary, knowledge
  acquisition, and culturally-specific learning opportunities that shape crystallized
  intelligence'
- 'Step 3: Crystallized intelligence measures capture culturally-sensitive knowledge
  that reflects cumulative environmental exposure and experiential learning'
- 'Step 4: This creates measurable associations between polygenic scores and crystallized
  cognitive outcomes that are mediated through environmental and experiential pathways'

  description: Access to high-quality educational environments that provide rich vocabulary
    and knowledge acquisition opportunities may strengthen the relationship between
    genetic propensities and crystallized intelligence outcomes

  description: Crystallized measures are more culturally sensitive, suggesting that
    cultural alignment with test content moderates the expression of genetic potential
