direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus SRV prevention and response services do not explicitly include LGBTQ+
  students or relationships in their messaging and materials'
- 'Step 2: LGBTQ+ students perceive services as designed for heterosexual/cisgender
  populations only, creating institutional invisibility'
- 'Step 3: Students experiencing SRV fear discrimination, misunderstanding, or invalidation
  when seeking help from non-affirming services'
- 'Step 4: LGBTQ+ students delay or avoid accessing campus support resources after
  experiencing SRV, leading to extended trauma exposure and reduced recovery'
