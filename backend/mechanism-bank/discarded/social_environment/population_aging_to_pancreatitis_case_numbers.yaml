mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: China''s demographic transition results in increasing proportion of elderly
  population'
- 'Step 2: Older age groups have higher accumulated lifetime exposure to risk factors
  and physiological vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 3: Even with declining age-standardized rates, the absolute number of older
  individuals at risk increases'
- 'Step 4: This demographic shift leads to rising absolute numbers of incident and
  prevalent pancreatitis cases (380,018 incident and 493,765 prevalent cases in 2019)'
