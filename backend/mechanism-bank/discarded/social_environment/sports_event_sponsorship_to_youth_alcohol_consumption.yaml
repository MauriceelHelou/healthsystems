  with youth audiences to maximize brand exposure and create positive associations'
- 'Step 2: Sponsorship integrates alcohol branding into sports culture, normalizing
  alcohol as part of athletic participation and spectatorship'
- 'Step 3: Youth exposure to alcohol brands in sports contexts creates aspirational
  connections between alcohol consumption and athletic achievement, social belonging,
  and entertainment'
- 'Step 4: Positive brand associations and normalization increase youth intentions
  to consume alcohol and actual consumption behaviors'
