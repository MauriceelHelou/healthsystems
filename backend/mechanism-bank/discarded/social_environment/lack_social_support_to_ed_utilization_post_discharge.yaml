direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of friends or family support leaves gunshot wound survivors without
  assistance for post-discharge care tasks (wound care, medication management, transportation)'
- 'Step 2: Lack of social support network reduces ability to monitor healing, recognize
  complications early, and access outpatient follow-up appointments'
- 'Step 3: Survivors face isolation in managing complex recovery needs without informal
  caregiving support'
- 'Step 4: Preventable complications develop or manageable concerns escalate, leading
  to emergency department visits'
