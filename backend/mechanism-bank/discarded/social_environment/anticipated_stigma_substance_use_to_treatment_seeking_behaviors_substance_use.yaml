category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with substance use problems anticipate experiencing stigmatization
  and discrimination if they disclose their substance use or seek treatment'
- 'Step 2: This anticipation is based on structural realities including documented
  discrimination in healthcare settings, employment, and social relationships'
- 'Step 3: Anticipated stigma creates psychological barriers including fear of judgment,
  rejection, and negative consequences of disclosure'
- 'Step 4: These barriers reduce actual treatment-seeking behaviors, even when individuals
  recognize the need for treatment'
