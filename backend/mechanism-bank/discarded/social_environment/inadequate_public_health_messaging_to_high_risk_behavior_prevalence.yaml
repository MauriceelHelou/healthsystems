direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current public health education focuses on texting-while-driving and DUI
  as separate risks rather than their synergistic effects'
- 'Step 2: Lack of awareness about dramatically increased impairment when combining
  behaviors leads to underestimation of risk'
- 'Step 3: High likelihood of texting while driving combined with high likelihood
  of drinking and driving creates frequent co-occurrence of behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Continued engagement in combined high-risk behaviors increases population-level
  crash risk, injuries, and fatalities'
