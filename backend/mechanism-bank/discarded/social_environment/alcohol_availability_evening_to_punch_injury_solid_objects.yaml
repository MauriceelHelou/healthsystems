direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Concentration of alcohol service establishments and extended evening operating
  hours creates temporal-spatial clustering of intoxication'
- 'Step 2: Evening alcohol consumption coincides with increased interpersonal conflicts
  and reduced social supports/interventions'
- 'Step 3: Intoxicated individuals encounter solid environmental structures (walls,
  doors, hard surfaces) during conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Punching of solid objects during evening hours results in metacarpal fractures
  and hand injuries requiring emergency care'
