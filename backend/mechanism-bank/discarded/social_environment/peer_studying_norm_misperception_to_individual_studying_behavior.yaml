direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students partially underestimate how much time their peers spend studying
  due to lower visibility of academic effort compared to social activities'
- 'Step 2: This misperception creates a perceived norm that studying less is acceptable
  or typical'
- 'Step 3: Students may reduce their own studying time to align with this underestimated
  peer norm'
- 'Step 4: The social environment thus suppresses academic engagement through normative
  influence based on incomplete information about peer behavior'
