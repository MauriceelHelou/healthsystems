direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Repeated exposure to physical, psychological, and sexual IPV creates traumatic
  stress through direct victimization experiences'
- 'Step 2: Co-occurrence of multiple IPV types compounds psychological trauma and
  overwhelms coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Chronic traumatic exposure triggers hypervigilance, intrusive thoughts,
  and avoidance behaviors characteristic of PTSD'
- 'Step 4: Daily variability in IPV exposure creates unpredictable threat environment
  maintaining elevated PTSD-related distress'
