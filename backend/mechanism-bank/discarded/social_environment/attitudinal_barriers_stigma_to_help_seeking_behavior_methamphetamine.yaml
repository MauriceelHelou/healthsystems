  node_name: Help-Seeking Behavior for Crystal Methamphetamine Use
direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal stigma and negative attitudes toward crystal methamphetamine use
  create fear of judgment and discrimination among people who use'
- 'Step 2: Anticipated stigma and shame reduce willingness to disclose substance use
  to healthcare providers or support networks'
- 'Step 3: Fear of social consequences (loss of relationships, employment, or custody)
  acts as deterrent to seeking formal help'
- 'Step 4: Reduced help-seeking leads to delayed or absent treatment engagement, prolonging
  substance use and associated harms'

  description: People with lived experience of crystal methamphetamine use demonstrated
    increased odds (OR 1.35) of reporting attitudinal barriers compared to knowledge
    barriers, suggesting stigma is more salient for this group than other stakeholder
    groups
