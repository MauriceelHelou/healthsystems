mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Within-individual changes in sports participation frequency create temporal
  variation in structured activity engagement'
- 'Step 2: Increased sports involvement may reduce available time and opportunities
  for alcohol consumption contexts'
- 'Step 3: However, after accounting for concurrent changes in family structure, leisure
  patterns, and behavioral characteristics, the protective effect of increased sports
  participation is minimal or absent'
