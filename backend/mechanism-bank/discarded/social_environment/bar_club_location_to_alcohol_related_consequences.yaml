mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bars/clubs operate as commercial establishments with regulatory oversight,
  liability concerns, and trained staff (security, bartenders)'
- 'Step 2: These venues have structural incentives and legal requirements to monitor
  patron behavior and limit extreme intoxication'
- 'Step 3: Students perceive lower descriptive and injunctive norms for alcohol consequences
  in these regulated settings'
- 'Step 4: The combination of environmental controls, professional supervision, and
  lower normative acceptance results in fewer reported consequences relative to informal
  settings'
