direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural changes including policy interventions, reduced alcohol marketing
  exposure, and shifting social norms led to declining youth alcohol consumption from
  2001-2016'
- 'Step 2: As drinking became less normative among teenagers, youth who continued
  to initiate early increasingly represented a smaller, more concentrated high-risk
  population'
- 'Step 3: Early drinking shifted from a common experimentation behavior to a stronger
  marker of broader risk-taking and vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: This concentration effect strengthened the association between early initiation
  and later alcohol-related harms in young adulthood'
