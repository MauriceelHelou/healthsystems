  in society and healthcare systems'
- 'Step 2: Experiences of racial stigma lead to internalization of negative self-perceptions
  related to mental illness or addiction (self-stigma)'
- 'Step 3: Internalized self-stigma contributes to development of depressive symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Depressive symptoms and self-stigma create psychological and practical
  barriers to seeking behavioral health treatment'
