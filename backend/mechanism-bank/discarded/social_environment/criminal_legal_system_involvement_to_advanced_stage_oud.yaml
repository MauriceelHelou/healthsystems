direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women involved in the criminal legal system have often been actively using
  illicit opioid substances without adequate access to healthcare or treatment'
- 'Step 2: Criminalization and incarceration interrupt healthcare continuity and prevent
  early intervention for substance use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Lack of treatment access combined with continued substance use leads to
  progression to advanced-stage OUD with compromised physical and mental health'
- 'Step 4: Women reach jails with untreated, advanced-stage substance use disorders
  that have not been previously identified by healthcare systems'
