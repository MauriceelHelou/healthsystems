direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students observe and internalize perceptions that most peers use
  alcohol irresponsibly, creating a descriptive social norm environment'
- 'Step 2: Unhealthy social norms shape expectations about acceptable drinking behavior
  and reduce motivation to deviate from peer behavior'
- 'Step 3: When gain-framed messages are presented in context of unhealthy norms,
  deviance regulation theory suggests students may distance themselves from the unhealthy
  norm'
- 'Step 4: However, the overall unhealthy normative environment creates barriers to
  forming intentions for responsible drinking behavior'

  description: Gain-framed messages produce more favorable responses than loss-framed
    messages, especially when unhealthy social norms are perceived. Gain framing helps
    students distance themselves from unhealthy normative behavior.

  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Heavy drinkers show mitigated deviance regulation effects on intention
    to drink responsibly. Individual consumption level reduces the effectiveness of
    normative influence and message framing interventions.
