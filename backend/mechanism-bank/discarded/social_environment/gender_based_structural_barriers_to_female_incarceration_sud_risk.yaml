direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women face compounded structural vulnerabilities including higher rates
  of trauma, intimate partner violence, and economic marginalization'
- 'Step 2: Gender-specific barriers to healthcare access and substance use treatment
  (childcare responsibilities, stigma, lack of women-centered services)'
- 'Step 3: Criminal justice policies disproportionately impact women with SUDs who
  engage in survival behaviors (e.g., sex work, petty theft)'
- 'Step 4: Prison systems lack gender-responsive treatment programming, perpetuating
  substance use patterns'

  description: Denmark showed smaller gender disparity (3.4 percentage points) compared
    to Norway (13.2 points) and Sweden (13.7 points), possibly reflecting differential
    gender-responsive policies or treatment access
