direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universities structure social life through institutional policies, physical
  spaces, and sanctioned/unsanctioned social practices'
- 'Step 2: These modifiable structural factors shape the contexts and motivations
  for student alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Prevention programs that target these specific social structures can address
  root causes of varied drinking practices'
- 'Step 4: Context-specific interventions that modify social environments are more
  effective than individual-focused approaches'
