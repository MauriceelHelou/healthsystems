- 'Step 1: Autistic youth face systemic social exclusion, ableism, and lack of neurodiversity-affirming
  relationship education'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to tailored dating violence prevention programs leaves autistic
  youth without adequate tools to recognize warning signs'
- 'Step 3: Communication differences and social-cognitive variations may create challenges
  in navigating complex relationship dynamics and power imbalances'
- 'Step 4: Societal devaluation of autistic individuals may be internalized or exploited
  by abusive partners, increasing vulnerability to victimization'
