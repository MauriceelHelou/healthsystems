direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol intoxication impairs cognitive processing and attention in convivial
  drinking contexts'
- 'Step 2: Impaired cognitive function reduces accurate recall and perception of events
  unfolding in the environment'
- 'Step 3: Reduced perceptual accuracy decreases ability to notice nonconsensual sexual
  behavior occurring in social settings'
- 'Step 4: Failure to detect sexual assault prevents progression through subsequent
  bystander intervention steps'
