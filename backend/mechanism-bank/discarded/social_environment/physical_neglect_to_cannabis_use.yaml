  node_id: cannabis_use
  node_name: Cannabis Use
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Physical neglect (inadequate provision of basic needs like food, shelter,
  supervision) creates chronic stress during developmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress and unmet basic needs alter neurobiological development,
  particularly in reward and stress response systems'
- 'Step 3: Altered neurodevelopment increases vulnerability to substance use as compensatory
  behavior'
- 'Step 4: Physical neglect signals broader family dysfunction and lack of protective
  monitoring against substance use initiation'
