direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adolescents perceive drinking behaviors among their peer networks, forming
  normative expectations about alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: High and stable peer drinking norms create social environments where alcohol
  use is normalized and expected'
- 'Step 3: Sustained exposure to high peer drinking norms across the high school to
  college transition reinforces alcohol-related behaviors'
- 'Step 4: These persistent high-norm environments lead to negative developmental
  outcomes through increased alcohol use patterns'
