mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry enters into formal contracts with 88% of university student
  sports clubs, providing discounted beer, promotional materials, and equipment in
  exchange for exclusive sales agreements'
- 'Step 2: Sports clubs organize events and parties where the sponsored alcohol brand
  is exclusively sold and heavily promoted through branded materials (t-shirts, freezers,
  stereo systems) and industry event promoters'
- 'Step 3: Open bar arrangements (free alcohol events) are provided in 81% of sponsorship
  agreements, creating environments of increased alcohol availability at university
  social and sporting events'
- 'Step 4: Students attending these sponsored events are exposed to increased alcohol
  marketing, normalized drinking culture in sports settings, and reduced financial
  barriers to consumption through discounts and free alcohol'
