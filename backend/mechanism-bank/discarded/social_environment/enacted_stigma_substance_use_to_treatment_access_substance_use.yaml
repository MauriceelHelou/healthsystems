mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with substance use disorders experience actual discrimination
  and stigmatization in healthcare settings, employment, housing, and social relationships'
- 'Step 2: These discriminatory experiences create direct barriers to accessing and
  continuing treatment, including refusal of services, inadequate care, or hostile
  treatment environments'
- 'Step 3: Enacted stigma reinforces both internalized stigma and anticipated stigma,
  creating a cycle that perpetuates treatment barriers'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative impact of enacted stigma reduces both initial treatment
  access and retention in treatment programs'
