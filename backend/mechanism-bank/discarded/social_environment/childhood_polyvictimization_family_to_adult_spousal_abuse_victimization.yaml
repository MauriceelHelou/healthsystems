direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple victimization experiences in childhood family contexts create
  developmental trauma and normalize abusive relationship patterns'
- 'Step 2: Polyvictimization impairs ability to recognize early warning signs of abusive
  partners and establish healthy relationship boundaries'
- 'Step 3: Childhood trauma affects attachment patterns and self-worth, increasing
  vulnerability to entering or remaining in abusive relationships'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to supportive resources and trauma-informed services compounds
  vulnerability to revictimization in adult intimate partnerships'
