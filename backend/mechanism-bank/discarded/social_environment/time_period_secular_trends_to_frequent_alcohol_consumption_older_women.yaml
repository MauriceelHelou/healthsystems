direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal shifts over 22-year period alter normative expectations and social
  acceptability of alcohol consumption for women'
- 'Step 2: Changing gender norms reduce traditional constraints on women''s drinking
  behavior in older age cohorts'
- 'Step 3: Increased social and cultural acceptance creates environments where frequent
  drinking becomes normalized for older women'
- 'Step 4: Women''s drinking patterns converge toward historically male drinking frequencies'
