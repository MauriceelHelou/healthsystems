  node_id: binge_drinking

direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Residents who have lived in neighborhood <5 years have weaker social networks
  and less established community ties'
- 'Step 2: In gentrifying neighborhoods, rapid physical and social changes disrupt
  opportunities for community connection and social cohesion'
- 'Step 3: Newer residents lack the protective buffering effects of long-term social
  support networks against gentrification stressors'
- 'Step 4: Combination of gentrification pressures (financial strain, displacement
  anxiety) and social isolation increases stress and reduces coping resources'
- 'Step 5: Newer residents turn to binge drinking as maladaptive coping mechanism
  in absence of strong community support'
