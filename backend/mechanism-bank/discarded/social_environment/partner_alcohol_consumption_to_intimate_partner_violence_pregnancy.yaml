  node_name: Intimate Partner Violence During Pregnancy
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Partner alcohol consumption creates physiological disinhibition and impaired
  cognitive functioning, reducing behavioral control'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced cognitive impairment reduces capacity for conflict resolution
  and increases aggressive responses to stress'
- 'Step 3: Economic stress from alcohol expenditure in low-resource settings compounds
  household tensions'
- 'Step 4: Social norms in contexts where alcohol use is normalized may reinforce
  violent behaviors as acceptable responses'
- 'Step 5: Pregnant women experience heightened vulnerability due to physical changes
  and economic dependence, increasing exposure to violence'
