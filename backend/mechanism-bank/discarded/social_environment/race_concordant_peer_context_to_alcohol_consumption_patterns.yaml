mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black college students navigate racialized campus environments where social
  contexts vary by racial composition of peers present'
- 'Step 2: Greater likelihood of drinking excessively specifically around peers who
  share the same racial identity creates race-concordant drinking contexts'
- 'Step 3: These race-specific social contexts may provide psychological safety, reduce
  racial stress, or reinforce race-specific normative behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Increased drinking in race-concordant contexts impacts overall alcohol
  consumption patterns for Black students'
