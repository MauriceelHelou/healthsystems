- 'Step 1: Prior criminal history reflects exposure to criminogenic environments and
  circumstances'
- 'Step 2: Criminal justice involvement disrupts employment, housing, and social support
  systems'
- 'Step 3: Systemic barriers post-incarceration limit access to treatment and recovery
  resources'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated disadvantages increase likelihood of substance use and impaired
  driving'
- 'Step 5: Higher probability of DUI recidivism within 12 months, particularly among
  males'
