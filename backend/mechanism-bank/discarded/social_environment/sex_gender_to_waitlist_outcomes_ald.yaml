direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women with ALD face differential biological progression of liver disease
  and potentially different access to pre-listing addiction treatment'
- 'Step 2: Gender-based differences in healthcare engagement, social support, and
  evaluation for transplant affect who gets listed and at what disease severity'
- 'Step 3: Women listed for ALD transplant may have more advanced disease or face
  different clinical trajectories than men'
- 'Step 4: These factors contribute to women''s higher risk of wait-list removal for
  death or deterioration despite meeting listing criteria'
