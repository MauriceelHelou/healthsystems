mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IPV exposure creates chronic stress, fear, and psychological distress in
  daily life'
- 'Step 2: Women experiencing IPV have limited access to formal support systems and
  resources due to isolation and control by perpetrators'
- 'Step 3: Substance use serves as coping mechanism to manage PTSD symptoms, physical
  pain, and emotional distress from ongoing violence'
- 'Step 4: Daily variability in IPV episodes corresponds with temporal patterns of
  substance use as immediate stress response'
