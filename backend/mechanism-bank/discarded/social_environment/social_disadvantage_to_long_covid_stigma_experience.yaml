mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social disadvantage creates pre-existing marginalization and vulnerability
  to stigmatization'
- 'Step 2: Disadvantaged groups face intersecting stigmas (e.g., related to socioeconomic
  status, race, disability) that compound Long Covid stigma'
- 'Step 3: Limited social capital and institutional power reduce ability to challenge
  or resist stigmatizing narratives'
- 'Step 4: Increased stigma experience further marginalizes disadvantaged individuals,
  intensifying barriers to care and social support'
