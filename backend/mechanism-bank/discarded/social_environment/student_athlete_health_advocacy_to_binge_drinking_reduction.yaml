  positions athletes as health messengers'
- 'Step 2: Student-athletes deliver anti-binge drinking messages leveraging their
  social status and visibility on campus'

  than traditional health education channels'
- 'Step 4: Effective message elaboration fostered by source credibility leads to reduced
  behavioral intentions to binge drink among student populations'
