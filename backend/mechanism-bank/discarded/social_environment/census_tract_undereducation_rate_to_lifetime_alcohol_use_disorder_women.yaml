direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High undereducation neighborhoods may maintain stronger traditional social
  controls and family cohesion that protect women from alcohol misuse'
- 'Step 2: Lower educational attainment areas may have cultural norms that more strictly
  regulate women''s drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Reduced exposure to settings or social contexts where heavy drinking occurs
  for women'
- 'Step 4: Lower lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder among women in high undereducation
  areas'
