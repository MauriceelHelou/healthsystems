mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol brands sponsor sports events and create YouTube content documenting
  this sponsorship, reaching broad audiences including sports fans'
- 'Step 2: Sports sponsorship content associates alcohol consumption with athletic
  achievement, excitement, and communal celebration'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to sports-alcohol associations through YouTube videos
  creates cognitive links between sports viewing and drinking occasions'
- 'Step 4: Viewers internalize alcohol consumption as normative behavior during sports
  events, increasing likelihood of event-specific drinking'
