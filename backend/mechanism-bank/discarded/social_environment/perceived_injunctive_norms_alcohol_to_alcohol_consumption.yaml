direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students perceive that peers approve of alcohol consumption, creating social
  expectations around drinking behavior'
- 'Step 2: To gain social approval and avoid social exclusion, students align their
  behavior with perceived peer approval'
- 'Step 3: Students increase alcohol consumption to meet perceived normative expectations,
  particularly when motivated by need for social connection'
- 'Step 4: This mechanism is strengthened when students experience lower sense of
  belonging and are more motivated to fit in'
