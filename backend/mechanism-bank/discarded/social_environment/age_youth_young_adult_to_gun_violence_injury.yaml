direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth and young adults (≤24 years) experience structural vulnerabilities
  including limited economic opportunities, educational disruptions, and residential
  instability'
- 'Step 2: These structural conditions concentrate young people in environments with
  higher firearm availability and exposure to violence'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to protective factors (counseling, peer support, legal services)
  leaves YYAs without violence prevention resources'
- 'Step 4: Disproportionate exposure to gun violence results in higher rates of firearm-related
  injuries compared to older adults'
