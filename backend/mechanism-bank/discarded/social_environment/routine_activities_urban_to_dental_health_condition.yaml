mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular routine activities in urban areas (work, social engagement, errands)
  create more frequent opportunities to access healthcare facilities that are geographically
  proximate'
- 'Step 2: Routine urban mobility patterns increase awareness of available dental
  services and reduce perceived barriers to care-seeking'
- 'Step 3: Integration of dental care into regular activity patterns facilitates preventive
  care and early treatment of dental problems'
- 'Step 4: Consistent engagement with dental services through routine-facilitated
  access improves maintenance of dental health and tooth retention'
