direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: During COVID-19 pandemic, overall population alcohol consumption decreases
  (due to closed venues, reduced social gatherings, economic constraints)'
- 'Step 2: Despite overall decrease, consumption polarizes - light/moderate drinkers
  reduce consumption while heaviest drinkers increase consumption'
- 'Step 3: Fully alcohol-attributable mortality is driven primarily by heavy drinking
  patterns, not population average consumption'
- 'Step 4: Increased heavy drinking among high-risk subgroup leads to increased mortality
  despite decreased population-level consumption, revealing paradoxical inverse relationship'

  description: Greater polarization between light/moderate drinkers (decreasing) and
    heavy drinkers (increasing) strengthens the paradoxical inverse relationship between
    population consumption and mortality

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: More severe crisis conditions may intensify polarization, with stress-related
    increases in heavy drinking offsetting venue-closure-related decreases in social
    drinking
