- 'Step 1: Students develop personal approval attitudes about drinking in specific
  locations based on social and environmental cues'
- 'Step 2: These location-specific approval attitudes reflect internalized norms about
  appropriateness of drinking in different settings'
- 'Step 3: Personal approval in a given location reduces internal barriers to drinking
  in that environment'
- 'Step 4: Higher personal approval of drinking in a location leads to increased alcohol
  consumption in that same location'
