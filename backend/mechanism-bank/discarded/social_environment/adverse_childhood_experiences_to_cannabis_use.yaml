direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adverse childhood experiences create toxic stress during critical developmental
  periods'
- 'Step 2: Toxic stress exposure alters neurodevelopment in reward pathways (dopaminergic
  system) and stress response systems'
- 'Step 3: Altered neurobiological systems increase vulnerability to reward deficiency
  syndrome behaviors including substance use'
- 'Step 4: ACEs interact with genetic polymorphisms in dopaminergic and endocannabinoid
  pathways to influence cannabis use susceptibility'
