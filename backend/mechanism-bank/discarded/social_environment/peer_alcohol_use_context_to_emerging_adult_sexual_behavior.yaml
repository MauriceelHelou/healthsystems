mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peer networks create social contexts and activities where alcohol consumption
  is normative and facilitated'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption in peer contexts reduces inhibitions and alters decision-making
  capacity regarding sexual behavior'
- 'Step 3: Peer-facilitated drinking environments increase likelihood of sexual encounters
  and sexual behavior engagement'
- 'Step 4: Repeated exposure to peer drinking contexts establishes patterns linking
  alcohol use with sexual activity'
