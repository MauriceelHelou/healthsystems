mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College years represent developmental transition period with increased
  autonomy and reduced parental supervision'
- 'Step 2: Campus environments create social contexts where alcohol is readily available
  and drinking behaviors are visible'
- 'Step 3: Peer influences and perceived social norms on campus shape expectations
  about alcohol experimentation'
- 'Step 4: Campus culture that normalizes drinking creates permissive environment
  for experimentation with alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: Students engage in alcohol experimentation behaviors influenced by broader
  campus cultural norms'
