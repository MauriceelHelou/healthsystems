category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Illness models and stakeholder messaging emphasize an artificial line between
  ''normal'' drinkers and ''alcoholic others'''
- 'Step 2: This dichotomization creates an othering process that separates ''us''
  from ''them'''
- 'Step 3: The pathologized category becomes associated with deviance and moral failure
  despite medical framing'
- 'Step 4: Stigma is inadvertently reinforced even by groups attempting to reduce
  alcohol harm'
