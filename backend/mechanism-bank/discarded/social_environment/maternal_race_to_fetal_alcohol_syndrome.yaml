- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential exposure to socioeconomic stressors,
  trauma, and environmental toxins that may increase substance use risk during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Racial disparities in prenatal care access, quality of care, and patient-provider
  communication affect screening, counseling, and early intervention opportunities'
- 'Step 3: Surveillance bias and diagnostic practices may lead to differential identification
  and reporting of FAS across racial groups'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effects of structural racism across multiple domains create
  differential vulnerability to alcohol-related birth outcomes'
