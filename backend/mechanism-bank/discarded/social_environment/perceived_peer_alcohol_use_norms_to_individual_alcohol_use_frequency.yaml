mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students form perceptions about typical peers'' alcohol use behaviors
  and changes in use patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic'
- 'Step 2: These normative perceptions create a social reference point that shapes
  students'' beliefs about acceptable and expected drinking behaviors within their
  peer context'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own alcohol use frequency to align with perceived
  peer norms, increasing use when they perceive peers are increasing and decreasing
  use when they perceive peers are decreasing'
- 'Step 4: Strong correlation between perceived changes in peer drinking and changes
  in individual drinking frequency establishes normative influence as a key determinant
  of alcohol use behavior'
