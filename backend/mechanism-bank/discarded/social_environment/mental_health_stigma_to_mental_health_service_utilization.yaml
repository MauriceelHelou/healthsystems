direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cultural and institutional norms create stigmatizing attitudes toward mental
  illness and mental health treatment, particularly pronounced in military contexts
  emphasizing strength and self-reliance'
- 'Step 2: Internalized stigma generates fear of social judgment, discrimination,
  or perceived weakness if seeking mental health care'
- 'Step 3: Anticipated stigma increases psychological costs of help-seeking and may
  trigger avoidance behaviors'
- 'Step 4: However, study findings indicate stigma was NOT a primary barrier—problem
  recognition and treatment beliefs had stronger associations with utilization'
