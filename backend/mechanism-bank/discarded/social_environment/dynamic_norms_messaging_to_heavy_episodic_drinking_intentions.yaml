category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dynamic norms messaging presents information that heavy drinking episodes
  are becoming less common among peers'
- 'Step 2: Students internalize the message that binge drinking is a declining rather
  than stable or increasing behavior'
- 'Step 3: Lower perceived future norms for heavy episodic drinking reduce anticipated
  social rewards for binge drinking'
- 'Step 4: Students report lower intentions to engage in heavy episodic drinking behaviors'

  description: Dynamic norms messaging had a favorable indirect effect on heavy episodic
    drinking intentions mediated through lower perceived future drinking norms, suggesting
    the mechanism operates through normative perceptions
