mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Professional development component provides ongoing evidence and examples
  of effective RBS techniques through social media posts and peer support'
- 'Step 2: Servers observe and learn about successful applications of service refusal
  strategies from experienced peers'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to effectiveness messaging increases servers'' beliefs
  that RBS practices actually work to prevent intoxication and related harms'
- 'Step 4: Higher response efficacy motivates servers to implement and persist with
  RBS practices even when facing challenging patron interactions'
