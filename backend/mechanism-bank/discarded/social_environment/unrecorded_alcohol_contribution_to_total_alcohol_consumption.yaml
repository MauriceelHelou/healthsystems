mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unrecorded alcohol sources (homemade, illicit, cross-border) supplement
  recorded alcohol markets'
- 'Step 2: These sources add to total alcohol availability in the population environment'
- 'Step 3: Increased total availability enables higher per capita consumption beyond
  what recorded sales suggest'
- 'Step 4: Unrecorded sources account for 7% of per capita consumption, representing
  a substantial hidden component of population alcohol exposure'
