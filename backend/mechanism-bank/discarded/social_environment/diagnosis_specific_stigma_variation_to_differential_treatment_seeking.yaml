direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community stigma creates hierarchical perceptions of mental illness legitimacy
  and severity across diagnoses'
- 'Step 2: Higher stigma for schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder compared to depression
  and anxiety creates differential social acceptance of help-seeking'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with highly stigmatized conditions face greater structural
  discrimination and social barriers when attempting to access treatment'
- 'Step 4: This creates inequitable treatment access patterns where those with the
  most severe conditions face the greatest barriers'
