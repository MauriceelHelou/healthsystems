direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gendered social norms and occupational cultures create differential exposure
  to pancreatitis risk factors, particularly alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Men in China face greater social pressure and opportunities for heavy drinking
  in business and social contexts'
- 'Step 3: Higher alcohol consumption rates among men lead to increased toxic exposure
  to pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 4: This results in higher incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALYs from
  pancreatitis among men compared to women'
