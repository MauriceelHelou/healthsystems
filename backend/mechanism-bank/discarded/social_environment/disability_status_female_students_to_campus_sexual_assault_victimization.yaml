direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Female students with disabilities face systemic barriers in campus environments,
  including limited accessibility to safety resources, emergency services, and protective
  infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Disability status creates differential vulnerability through social isolation,
  reduced access to peer networks, and institutional gaps in accommodations for safety
  planning'
- 'Step 3: Perpetrators may target students with disabilities due to perceived increased
  vulnerability, reduced credibility in reporting, and institutional barriers to accessing
  support services'
- 'Step 4: Structural inadequacies in campus systems (housing, transportation, emergency
  response) create environments where students with disabilities experience heightened
  exposure to assault risk'
