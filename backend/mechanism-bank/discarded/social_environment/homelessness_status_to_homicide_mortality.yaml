- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates constant exposure to high-risk environments without
  protective barriers of secure housing'
- 'Step 2: Lack of safe refuge prevents escape from dangerous individuals or situations
  that could escalate to lethal violence'
- 'Step 3: Social marginalization and structural vulnerability reduce community protection
  and institutional support'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to violence without means of protection increases likelihood
  of fatal violent encounters'
