direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing quality exposes children to indoor environmental triggers
  including mold, dampness, pest allergens (cockroach, rodent), dust mites, and inadequate
  ventilation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure to these allergens and irritants causes airway inflammation,
  increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and worsening of asthma symptoms in children'
- 'Step 3: Poorly maintained housing also correlates with structural deficiencies
  that prevent adequate temperature regulation, increasing respiratory stress'
- 'Step 4: Children in low-quality housing experience more frequent and severe asthma
  exacerbations requiring emergency department visits and hospitalizations'
- 'Step 5: Higher housing quality reduces allergen exposure and environmental triggers,
  leading to better asthma control and decreased healthcare utilization'

description: This systematic review of 40 US-based population-level studies found
  consistent significant associations between housing quality and pediatric asthma
  healthcare utilization (ED visits and hospitalizations). Housing quality was identified
  as one of eight SDOH with consistent significant associations across the Healthy
  People SDOH framework domains. Poor housing quality increases exposure to indoor
  allergens and environmental triggers that exacerbate pediatric asthma, leading to
  increased emergency and hospital care.
