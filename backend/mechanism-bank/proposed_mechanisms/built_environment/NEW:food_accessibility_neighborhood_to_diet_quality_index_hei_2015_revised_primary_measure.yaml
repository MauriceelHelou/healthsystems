mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater food accessibility in the neighborhood environment (e.g., proximity
  to food outlets, transportation to food sources, affordability) reduces physical
  and economic barriers to obtaining food'
- 'Step 2: Reduced barriers facilitate more frequent shopping trips and access to
  a wider variety of food options, including fresh produce and healthier alternatives'
- 'Step 3: Increased access to diverse, healthy food options enables individuals to
  make healthier food choices and improve overall dietary quality'

description: A systematic review of 74 studies found consistent evidence that accessibility
  to food in the neighborhood environment is associated with dietary behavior. Of
  11 studies examining this relationship, 10 reported a positive association between
  greater food accessibility (proximity, transportation, affordability) and better
  dietary outcomes. This suggests that improving food accessibility in neighborhoods
  can facilitate healthier eating patterns by reducing barriers to obtaining nutritious
  foods.
