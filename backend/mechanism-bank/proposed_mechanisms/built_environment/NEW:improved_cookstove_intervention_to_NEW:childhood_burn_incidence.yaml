direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Improved cookstoves (ICS) replace traditional open-fire or three-stone
  cooking methods with enclosed combustion chambers and improved design features'
- 'Step 2: Enclosed stove designs reduce direct flame exposure and create physical
  barriers between the fire and household members, particularly children'
- 'Step 3: Improved stoves often feature more stable construction, elevated cooking
  surfaces, and reduced spillage risk compared to traditional ground-level cooking'
- 'Step 4: Reduced direct contact with open flames and hot surfaces decreases the
  incidence of accidental burns among children under five years'

description: Improved cookstove interventions significantly reduce childhood burn
  incidence in low- and middle-income countries. A meta-analysis of 3 studies with
  over 41,000 observations found that ICS interventions reduced childhood burn rates
  by 34% compared to traditional cooking methods. This protective effect is attributed
  to the enclosed combustion chambers, improved stability, and physical separation
  of flames from household members that characterize improved stove designs.
