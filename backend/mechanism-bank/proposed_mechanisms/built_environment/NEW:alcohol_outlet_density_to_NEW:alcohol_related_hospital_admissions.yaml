direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density in a geographic area increases the physical
  availability and accessibility of alcohol to residents'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability leads to higher alcohol consumption levels and greater
  likelihood of excess/binge drinking in the population'
- 'Step 3: Excess alcohol consumption causes acute and chronic health harms including
  alcohol-related injuries, liver disease, and other conditions'
- 'Step 4: These alcohol-related health conditions result in increased hospital admissions
  for affected individuals'

description: Higher alcohol outlet density in geographic areas increases alcohol availability,
  which facilitates higher consumption levels in the population. This excess consumption
  leads to acute alcohol-related injuries (particularly during nighttime hours) and
  chronic alcohol-related conditions, resulting in increased hospital admissions.
  The CHALICE study uses a natural experiment design to track changes in outlet density
  and corresponding changes in alcohol-related hospital admissions using the Patient
  Episode Database for Wales.
