direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban areas have greater concentration and density of health facilities,
  including hospitals, clinics, and skilled healthcare providers'
- 'Step 2: Urban residents experience shorter travel distances and better transportation
  infrastructure to access maternal health services'
- 'Step 3: Urban environments typically have better information access and health
  education promoting awareness of maternal health services'
- 'Step 4: Urban areas often have higher rates of formal employment providing health
  insurance or ability to pay for services'
- 'Step 5: These cumulative urban advantages result in significantly higher utilization
  of antenatal care, skilled delivery care, and postnatal care services'

description: Urban residence is strongly associated with increased maternal health
  care service utilization in developing countries. This systematic review and meta-analysis
  of 51 studies found that mothers living in urban areas were nearly three times more
  likely to receive antenatal care compared to rural mothers. Similar urban-rural
  inequalities were observed for skilled delivery care and postnatal care utilization,
  indicating a consistent pattern of urban advantage across the maternal health care
  continuum.
