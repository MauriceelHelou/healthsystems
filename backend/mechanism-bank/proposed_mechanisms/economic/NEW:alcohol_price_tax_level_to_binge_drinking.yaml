direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol taxes and prices increase the monetary cost of purchasing
  alcohol beverages'
- 'Step 2: Increased costs reduce the quantity of alcohol that consumers can afford
  or are willing to purchase within their budget constraints'
- 'Step 3: Price sensitivity affects heavy drinking occasions, as binge drinking episodes
  require consumption of multiple drinks'
- 'Step 4: Both experimental evidence (Happy Hour studies) and population-level data
  demonstrate reduced alcohol consumption when prices increase'
- 'Step 5: Reduced overall consumption translates to fewer binge drinking episodes
  across populations including youth, heavy drinkers, and chronic consumers'

description: Higher alcohol prices and taxes are inversely associated with binge drinking.
  A meta-analysis of 112 studies found a significant elasticity of -0.28 for heavy
  drinking, indicating that a 10% increase in price is associated with approximately
  2.8% reduction in heavy drinking. This relationship is supported by experimental
  evidence from barroom settings demonstrating that price changes directly affect
  consumption, as well as multiple systematic reviews confirming the inverse relationship
  between alcohol taxes and excessive drinking. The effect extends to alcohol-related
  disease and injury outcomes attributable to binge drinking.
