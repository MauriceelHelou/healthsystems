direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher household wealth index increases financial resources available for
  healthcare expenditures including transportation, service fees, and indirect costs'
- 'Step 2: Wealthier households have greater ability to overcome financial barriers
  to accessing maternal health facilities and services'
- 'Step 3: Reduced financial constraints enable more frequent and comprehensive utilization
  of antenatal care, skilled delivery, and postnatal care services'
- 'Step 4: A dose-response relationship exists where each higher wealth quintile shows
  progressively greater maternal health service utilization'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies from developing countries
  demonstrates that household wealth index is positively associated with maternal
  health care service utilization. Mothers in the second wealth quintile were 62%
  more likely to utilize antenatal care compared to the lowest wealth quintile (OR
  1.62; 95% CI 1.36-1.91), with progressively stronger associations at higher wealth
  levels. Similar wealth-based inequities were observed for skilled delivery care
  and postnatal care utilization.
