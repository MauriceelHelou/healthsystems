description: Supplemental income programs reduce poverty rates by directly increasing
  household income through cash transfers and benefits. This systematic review found
  clear benefits from policies that improve socioeconomic status and opportunities,
  though findings across specific programs were largely mixed. The evidence supports
  structural-level interventions that address economic determinants of health.
