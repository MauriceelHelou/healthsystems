direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher area-level poverty rates are associated with reduced access to primary
  care and preventive health services for children with asthma'
- 'Step 2: Limited preventive care leads to poor asthma control, increased symptom
  severity, and lack of proper medication management'
- 'Step 3: High-poverty areas often have worse environmental conditions (air quality,
  housing quality) that trigger and exacerbate asthma symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate disease management and environmental exposures result in acute
  asthma exacerbations requiring emergency department visits and hospitalizations'

description: This systematic review of 40 US-based studies found consistent significant
  associations between area-level poverty rates and increased pediatric asthma healthcare
  utilization (ED visits and hospitalizations). Poverty was one of the most frequently
  studied social determinants and demonstrated reliable positive associations with
  acute care utilization across multiple geographic analyses. The relationship operates
  through interconnected pathways including reduced healthcare access, poor environmental
  conditions, substandard housing quality, and limited resources for disease management.
