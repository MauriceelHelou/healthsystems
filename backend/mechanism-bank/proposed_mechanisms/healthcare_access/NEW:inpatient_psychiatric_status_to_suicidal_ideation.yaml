mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inpatient psychiatric admission typically occurs for individuals with severe
  psychiatric symptoms, indicating acute illness severity and crisis states'
- 'Step 2: Inpatient settings concentrate individuals at highest risk who are experiencing
  acute psychological distress, hopelessness, and decompensation'
- 'Step 3: The severity of illness warranting hospitalization is associated with greater
  symptom burden including suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Meta-analysis demonstrates that inpatient status is significantly associated
  with higher point prevalence of suicidal ideation compared to outpatient populations'

description: Inpatient psychiatric status is positively associated with suicidal ideation
  prevalence. This meta-analysis of 26 studies found that source of patients (inpatient
  vs. outpatient) was significantly associated with point prevalence of suicidal ideation
  among people with schizophrenia. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation was
  34.5% and point prevalence was 29.9%, with inpatients showing elevated rates. The
  association reflects that psychiatric hospitalization captures individuals during
  periods of acute crisis and severe symptomatology, when suicidal ideation is most
  likely to be present.
