mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with liver disease receive alcohol use disorder (AUD) intervention
  through integrated (colocated liver and addiction clinics) or concomitant (separate
  hepatology and addiction clinics) care models'
- 'Step 2: AUD intervention promotes alcohol abstinence (abstinence rate 0.41 per
  person-year) and reduces alcohol relapse through structured treatment and monitoring'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases ongoing hepatotoxic injury to already
  compromised liver tissue'
- 'Step 4: Decreased hepatic insult allows for stabilization or improvement of liver
  function, reducing progression to decompensation'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of liver decompensation result in reduced hospitalizations,
  with odds of decompensation decreased by 44% and 30-day readmission reduced by 59%'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 studies (38,329 patients, 7,072
  receiving AUD intervention) demonstrates that simultaneous management of alcohol
  use disorder in patients with liver disease significantly reduces liver decompensation
  by 44%, 30-day hospital readmission by 59%, and mortality by 58% compared to standard
  of care. The mechanism operates through achieving abstinence and reducing alcohol
  relapse, thereby preventing ongoing hepatotoxic injury and allowing liver stabilization.
