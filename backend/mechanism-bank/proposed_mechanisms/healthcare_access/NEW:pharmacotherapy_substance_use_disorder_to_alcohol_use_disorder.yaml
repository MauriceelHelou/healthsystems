mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders (e.g., naltrexone, acamprosate,
  disulfiram) is prescribed to individuals with alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Medications act on neurobiological pathways to reduce alcohol cravings,
  block rewarding effects of alcohol, or create aversive reactions to alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced cravings and altered reward/punishment mechanisms lead to decreased
  alcohol consumption and lower relapse rates'
- 'Step 4: When combined with trauma-focused therapy for comorbid PTSD, synergistic
  effects enhance treatment outcomes through addressing both psychological and physiological
  components'
- 'Step 5: Sustained pharmacotherapy adherence results in clinically significant reductions
  in alcohol use disorder severity'

description: This meta-analysis of 36 trials (N=4,046) demonstrates that pharmacotherapy
  for substance use disorders significantly reduces alcohol use disorder severity,
  with a large effect size (d=-1.10) when combined with trauma-focused therapy. Pharmacological
  interventions targeting alcohol use showed consistent benefits across multiple treatment
  approaches, with sustained improvements observed at 12-month follow-up.
