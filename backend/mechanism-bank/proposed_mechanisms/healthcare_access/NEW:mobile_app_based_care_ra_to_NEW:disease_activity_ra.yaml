mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile applications provide RA patients with accessible tools for disease
  monitoring, symptom tracking, and medication reminders, increasing engagement with
  their care regimen'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced patient engagement facilitates more timely communication with
  healthcare providers and enables real-time adjustments to treatment plans based
  on symptom reporting'
- 'Step 3: Continuous monitoring and improved adherence to treatment protocols leads
  to better disease control and reduced inflammatory activity'
- 'Step 4: Sustained disease management through mobile app-based care results in measurable
  reductions in disease activity scores, joint pain, and improved quality of life
  outcomes'

description: Mobile application-based care demonstrates effectiveness in reducing
  disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis
  of 8 randomized controlled trials (n=3175) found that mobile apps facilitate better
  disease management through enhanced monitoring, medication adherence support, and
  patient-provider communication, leading to improved disease activity scores, reduced
  joint pain, and better quality of life.

  description: Intervention durations ranged from 6 weeks to 12 months; longer durations
    may provide more sustained benefits
- name: self_management_component

  strength: weak
  description: The impact on self-management was not clearly established, suggesting
    this pathway may be less effective for self-management outcomes compared to clinical
    disease activity measures
