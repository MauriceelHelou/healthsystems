category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary dental implantation is performed simultaneously with free bone
  flap reconstruction during oncologic surgery for oral cavity malignant tumors'
- 'Step 2: Simultaneous placement allows implants to integrate with vascularized bone
  graft during initial healing phase, before potential bone resorption or radiotherapy-induced
  changes occur'
- 'Step 3: Earlier implant placement enables faster prosthetic rehabilitation, reducing
  time to functional dental restoration'
- 'Step 4: Primary implantation results in higher implant survival rates (92.5%) compared
  to secondary/delayed implantation (88.5%), improving long-term orofacial function
  and quality of life'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies (284 patients,
  1427 implants) demonstrates that primary dental implantation performed simultaneously
  with free bone flap reconstruction for oral cancer achieves higher implant survival
  rates (92.5%) compared to secondary/delayed implantation (88.5%). Primary implantation
  allows for prosthetic rehabilitation during the initial healing period, providing
  rapid functional and aesthetic improvement for oncologic patients.
