category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Interferon-alpha is administered to patients with acute hepatitis C virus
  (HCV) infection during the first six months following infection'
- 'Step 2: Interferon-alpha activates antiviral immune responses, including stimulation
  of natural killer cells and induction of interferon-stimulated genes that inhibit
  viral replication'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced immune response leads to viral clearance, preventing the transition
  from acute to chronic HCV infection'
- 'Step 4: Successful viral clearance is measured as sustained virological response
  (SVR), indicating absence of persistent HCV RNA in blood'
- 'Step 5: Patients achieving SVR avoid progression to chronic HCV infection, reducing
  incidence of chronic disease and associated long-term complications'

description: Very low quality evidence from a Cochrane systematic review suggests
  that interferon-alpha may decrease the incidence of chronic HCV infection as measured
  by sustained virological response in patients with acute HCV infection. The review
  identified 3 trials (99 participants) comparing interferon-alpha versus no intervention.
  However, clinical outcomes such as health-related quality of life, reduction in
  cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and liver transplantation have not been
  reported. The applicability of these findings to current clinical practice is uncertain
  given the dominance of pegylated interferons and direct-acting antivirals in modern
  treatment protocols.
