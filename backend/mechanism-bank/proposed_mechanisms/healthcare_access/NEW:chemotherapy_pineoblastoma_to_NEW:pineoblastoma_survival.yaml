category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adult patients diagnosed with pineoblastoma receive chemotherapy as part
  of multimodal treatment approach'
- 'Step 2: Chemotherapeutic agents target rapidly dividing pineoblastoma tumor cells,
  inducing cell death and reducing tumor burden'
- 'Step 3: Chemotherapy works synergistically with other treatment modalities (surgery,
  radiotherapy) to achieve better disease control'
- 'Step 4: Reduced tumor burden and improved disease control leads to improved overall
  survival outcomes'

description: Systematic review of 108 adult pineoblastoma cases from 32 articles demonstrated
  that chemotherapy treatment modality was beneficial for survival (P=0.020). The
  5-year survival rate was 49.5% and 10-year survival rate was 33.9%. Kaplan-Meier
  survival analysis confirmed chemotherapy's positive association with improved outcomes
  in this rare CNS malignancy.
