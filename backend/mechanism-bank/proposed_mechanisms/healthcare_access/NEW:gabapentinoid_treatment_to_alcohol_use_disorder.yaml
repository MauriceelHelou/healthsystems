mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) are prescribed for patients
  with alcohol use disorder as pharmacological treatment'
- 'Step 2: These medications modulate GABAergic neurotransmission and reduce neuronal
  excitability, addressing the neurobiological changes associated with chronic alcohol
  use'
- 'Step 3: Gabapentinoid treatment reduces alcohol withdrawal symptoms, cravings,
  depression, and sleep disturbances that typically drive continued alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: By alleviating these symptoms and reducing craving intensity, patients
  experience decreased motivation to consume alcohol'
- 'Step 5: Sustained treatment leads to reduced alcohol consumption, improved abstinence
  rates, and better AUD outcomes'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis evidence demonstrates that gabapentinoid
  medications (gabapentin and pregabalin) are effective treatments for alcohol use
  disorder. These medications work through multiple mechanisms including reducing
  withdrawal symptoms, decreasing alcohol cravings, and addressing comorbid depression
  and sleep disturbances that commonly accompany AUD. Access to these pharmacological
  treatments provides patients with evidence-based options for managing their alcohol
  use disorder.
