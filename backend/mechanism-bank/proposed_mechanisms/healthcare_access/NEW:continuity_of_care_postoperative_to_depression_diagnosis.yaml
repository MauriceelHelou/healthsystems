- 'Step 1: Continuity of care programs provide comprehensive, continuous, and personalized
  follow-up services extending beyond hospital discharge'
- 'Step 2: Ongoing care relationships enable early identification and intervention
  for psychological distress symptoms in postoperative patients'
- 'Step 3: Structured support systems address emotional needs, provide education,

  common after cancer surgery'
- 'Step 5: These combined effects significantly reduce postoperative depression symptoms
  in surgical patients'
