direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: African American and Hispanic elderly patients (65+) experience systemic
  barriers in accessing cardiac care facilities equipped for PCI procedures'
- 'Step 2: These populations face longer door-to-balloon times, indicating delays
  in receiving timely intervention after presenting with acute coronary syndromes'
- 'Step 3: Structural factors including differential hospital referral patterns, geographic
  distribution of cardiac catheterization labs, and potential implicit bias in treatment
  recommendations contribute to lower PCI utilization'
- 'Step 4: Insurance coverage disparities and socioeconomic factors compound access
  barriers, though Medicaid expansion has shown potential to reduce some disparities'
- 'Step 5: The cumulative effect results in significantly lower rates of PCI utilization
  among racial and ethnic minority elderly patients compared to White patients'

description: This systematic review of 10 studies demonstrates that African American
  and Hispanic patients aged 65 and older in America experience significantly lower
  rates of percutaneous coronary intervention utilization compared to White patients.
  The disparity manifests through longer door-to-balloon times and reduced access
  to PCI procedures, contributing to worse clinical outcomes including higher mortality
  rates and increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events.
