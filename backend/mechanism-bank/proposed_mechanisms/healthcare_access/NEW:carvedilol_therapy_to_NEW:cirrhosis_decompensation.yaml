mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carvedilol, a non-selective β-blocker with intrinsic vasodilatory activity,
  is administered to patients with compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant
  portal hypertension (CSPH)'
- 'Step 2: Carvedilol''s anti-α1-adrenergic activity ameliorates hepatic vascular
  resistance, a major mechanism of portal hypertension in early cirrhosis'
- 'Step 3: Reduction in portal pressure decreases the hemodynamic stress on the portal
  venous system and hepatic vasculature'
- 'Step 4: Lower portal hypertension reduces the risk of developing decompensating
  events such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy'
- 'Step 5: Prevention of decompensation maintains patients in the compensated state,
  associated with significantly better survival outcomes'

description: Long-term carvedilol therapy reduces the risk of cirrhosis decompensation
  in patients with compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension.
  This competing-risk meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (n=352) demonstrated that carvedilol
  significantly reduced decompensation risk (SHR 0.506, 95% CI 0.289-0.887, p=0.017)
  compared to control therapy (no active treatment or endoscopic variceal ligation).
  The mechanism involves carvedilol's unique vasodilatory properties that ameliorate
  hepatic vascular resistance, thereby reducing portal hypertension and preventing
  progression to decompensated cirrhosis.
