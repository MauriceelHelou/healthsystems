category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of systematic chronic disease screening programs within
  prison healthcare settings creates structured protocols for identifying undiagnosed
  conditions among incarcerated populations'
- 'Step 2: Screening programs overcome traditional barriers to healthcare access that
  existed prior to incarceration, including lack of insurance, transportation difficulties,
  and competing life priorities'
- 'Step 3: Standardized screening identifies previously undiagnosed chronic non-communicable
  diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) in a population
  with high rates of health inequalities'
- 'Step 4: Early detection through screening enables timely initiation of monitoring
  and management interventions, improving clinical outcomes and reducing risk of premature
  mortality'

description: Systematic review of 65 studies involving 18,311 participants across
  multiple countries demonstrates that chronic disease screening programs in prisons
  are associated with improved detection of non-communicable diseases. The prison
  setting provides a unique opportunity to reach populations with high rates of health
  inequalities who may have limited healthcare access prior to incarceration. Screening
  interventions were associated with improvements in various measures of clinical
  effectiveness, though the optimal intervention models remain unclear due to heterogeneity.
