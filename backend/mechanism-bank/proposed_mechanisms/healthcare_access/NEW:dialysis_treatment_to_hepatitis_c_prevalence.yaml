mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with chronic kidney disease require regular hemodialysis treatment,
  typically 3 times per week in dialysis centers'
- 'Step 2: In-center hemodialysis involves repeated vascular access, blood exposure,
  and shared equipment/environment among multiple patients'
- 'Step 3: Nosocomial transmission of HCV occurs within hemodialysis units through
  breaches in infection control practices, contaminated equipment, or environmental
  surfaces'
- 'Step 4: Patients on long-term hemodialysis accumulate exposure risk over time,
  with higher HCV prevalence (~10% in DOPPS studies) compared to general population
  (~1%)'
- 'Step 5: Transfers between dialysis facilities and modalities create additional
  opportunities for HCV exposure and transmission'

description: Hemodialysis treatment is associated with elevated hepatitis C virus
  infection prevalence through nosocomial transmission mechanisms in dialysis settings.
  The KDIGO 2018 guideline, based on systematic review of 125 studies, documents approximately
  10% HCV seroprevalence among hemodialysis patients compared to 1% in the general
  US population. This elevated risk results from repeated vascular access, blood exposure,
  shared equipment, and environmental contamination in dialysis centers. The guideline
  recommends universal HCV screening at dialysis initiation and upon facility transfers
  to identify infected patients and prevent further transmission.
