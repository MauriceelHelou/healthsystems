mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol use disorder and alcohol-associated cirrhosis are
  prescribed medications for alcohol use disorder (acamprosate or naltrexone)'
- 'Step 2: MAUD helps patients achieve and maintain abstinence from alcohol, reducing
  ongoing liver damage and alcohol-related complications'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases further hepatic injury, slows cirrhosis
  progression, and prevents decompensation events'
- 'Step 4: Improved liver function and reduced alcohol-related systemic effects lead
  to decreased all-cause mortality (HR 0.80)'

description: Medications for alcohol use disorder (acamprosate and naltrexone) are
  associated with a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality among patients with alcohol-associated
  cirrhosis and high-risk alcohol use behavior. This protective effect operates through
  improved abstinence rates, which reduces ongoing hepatic injury and prevents further
  cirrhosis progression. Despite their effectiveness, MAUD remain underutilized in
  this population, with only 9.7% of eligible patients receiving these medications.
