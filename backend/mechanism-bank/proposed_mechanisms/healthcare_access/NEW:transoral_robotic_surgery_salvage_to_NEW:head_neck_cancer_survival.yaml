mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with residual, recurrent, or second primary head and neck cancers
  in previously irradiated fields receive transoral robotic surgery (TORS) as a salvage
  treatment option'
- 'Step 2: TORS provides minimally invasive surgical access to tumors, enabling curative
  intent resection while minimizing surgical morbidity compared to traditional open
  techniques'
- 'Step 3: Reduced surgical trauma leads to shorter hospital stays (mean 8.5 days),
  faster tracheostomy decannulation (9.7 days), and lower rates of long-term functional
  dependence'
- 'Step 4: The technique achieves acceptable oncological control with 2-year overall
  survival rate of 73.8% and disease-free survival rate of 56.1% in this challenging
  salvage population'
- 'Step 5: Lower complication rates (32.3% pooled, with 92% being Clavien Dindo grade
  2-3) and reduced morbidity contribute to better overall survival outcomes compared
  to traditional open surgical approaches'

description: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) provides an effective salvage treatment
  option for patients with residual, recurrent, or second primary head and neck cancers
  in previously irradiated fields. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 15
  studies (515 patients) demonstrates that TORS achieves 2-year overall survival of
  73.8% and disease-free survival of 56.1%, with decreased morbidity and mortality
  compared to traditional open surgical techniques. The minimally invasive approach
  enables curative intent surgery with acceptable functional outcomes and complication
  rates.
