mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Direct psychotherapy specifically targets suicidal ideation through evidence-based
  therapeutic approaches (e.g., CBT for suicide prevention, DBT, safety planning interventions)'
- 'Step 2: Therapeutic interventions address cognitive distortions, emotion regulation
  deficits, and maladaptive coping strategies that maintain suicidal thinking'
- 'Step 3: Patients develop alternative cognitive frameworks, improved distress tolerance
  skills, and enhanced reasons for living'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in frequency, intensity, and duration of suicidal ideation as
  measured by validated multi-item assessments'

description: Direct psychotherapy targeting suicidality is associated with significant
  reductions in suicidal ideation. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 147 randomized
  clinical trials with 11,001 participants found that direct psychotherapy interventions
  produced a moderate effect size (Hedges g=-0.39) in reducing suicidal ideation compared
  to control conditions. This effect was consistent across sensitivity analyses, though
  substantial heterogeneity was observed (I²=83.2%), suggesting variability in treatment
  effects across studies and populations.
