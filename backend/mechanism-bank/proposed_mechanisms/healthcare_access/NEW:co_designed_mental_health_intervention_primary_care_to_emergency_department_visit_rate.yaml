- 'Step 1: Co-designed mental health interventions are developed with direct participation
  of people experiencing homelessness, ensuring services address actual needs and
  barriers to care'
- 'Step 2: User involvement in design increases acceptability, cultural appropriateness,
  and accessibility of primary mental healthcare services for this population'
- 'Step 3: Increased engagement with primary care mental health services provides
  ongoing support and early intervention for mental health conditions'
- 'Step 4: Regular primary care utilization reduces crisis escalation and unmet mental
  health needs that typically drive emergency department visits'
- 'Step 5: Improved mental health outcomes and continued access to appropriate care
  decreases reliance on emergency departments for mental health crises'

description: Co-designed mental health interventions in primary care settings reduce
  emergency department visit rates among people experiencing homelessness by providing
  accessible, user-centered mental health support that addresses their specific needs.
  This systematic review of 4 studies found that when people experiencing homelessness
  participate in designing mental health services, utilization of primary care increases
  while reliance on emergency departments decreases. The mechanism operates through
  improved service acceptability, better engagement with ongoing care, and early intervention
  that prevents mental health crises requiring emergency care.
