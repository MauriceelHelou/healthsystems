mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carvedilol, a non-selective beta-blocker with intrinsic alpha-blocking
  activity, is administered to patients with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices'
- 'Step 2: Carvedilol reduces hepatic venous pressure gradient more effectively than
  traditional non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol, nadolol)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced portal hypertension decreases risk of variceal bleeding, a major
  cause of mortality in cirrhotic patients'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding events may contribute to
  reduced all-cause mortality, though evidence remains uncertain'

description: This Cochrane systematic review of 10 randomized clinical trials (810
  participants) found no statistically significant difference in mortality between
  carvedilol and traditional non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol or nadolol)
  in adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices. While carvedilol showed a
  non-significant trend toward reduced mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48-1.53), with
  16/254 deaths in carvedilol group vs 19/253 in control group, the evidence was rated
  as low or very low quality due to high risk of bias across all included trials.
