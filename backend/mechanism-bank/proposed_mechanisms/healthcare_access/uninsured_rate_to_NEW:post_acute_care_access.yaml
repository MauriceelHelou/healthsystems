direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High uninsured rates in a population mean more patients lack health insurance
  coverage at the time of hospitalization for trauma or emergency general surgery'
- 'Step 2: Uninsured patients face barriers to discharge planning as post-acute care
  facilities (skilled nursing facilities, rehabilitation centers, home health services)
  require payment assurance or insurance coverage'
- 'Step 3: Without insurance coverage, patients are less likely to be accepted by
  post-acute care facilities or be able to afford these services, resulting in delayed
  discharges, discharges to home without adequate support, or prolonged acute care
  stays'
- 'Step 4: Insurance expansion policies (Medicaid expansion, healthcare reform) reduce
  uninsured rates, which increases the proportion of patients with coverage that post-acute
  care facilities will accept, improving access to appropriate post-discharge care'

description: Higher uninsured rates are associated with reduced access to post-acute
  care at hospital discharge. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies
  found that insurance expansion policies significantly reduced the odds of being
  uninsured (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.66) and were often associated with increased access
  to post-acute care at discharge for trauma and emergency general surgery patients.
  The mechanism operates through the requirement of payment assurance or insurance
  coverage by post-acute care facilities.
