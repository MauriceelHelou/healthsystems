direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Longer duration of naltrexone prescription (>30 days) provides sustained
  opioid receptor blockade, which reduces the rewarding effects of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Reduced reward from alcohol consumption leads to decreased cravings and
  lower rates of heavy drinking episodes'
- 'Step 3: Sustained medication adherence allows for better management of alcohol
  use disorder with improved liver enzyme levels (reduced AST and ALT)'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of heavy drinking and improved liver function reduce the likelihood
  of acute alcohol-related medical emergencies requiring hospitalization'

description: Shorter duration of naltrexone prescription (≤30 days) is independently
  associated with increased risk of subsequent alcohol-related hospitalization. Patients
  prescribed naltrexone for longer periods showed improved liver enzymes (lower AST
  and ALT) and reduced hospitalization rates, suggesting that sustained pharmacotherapy
  for alcohol use disorder provides protective effects against acute alcohol-related
  medical events requiring hospitalization.
