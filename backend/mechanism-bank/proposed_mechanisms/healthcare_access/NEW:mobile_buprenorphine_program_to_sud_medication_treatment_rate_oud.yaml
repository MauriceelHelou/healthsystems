  node_name: OUD Medication Treatment Rate
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile buprenorphine program deploys clinicians (psychiatrist, nurse care
  manager, outreach worker) directly to homeless encampments and locations where people
  with OUD congregate, eliminating transportation barriers to treatment access'
- 'Step 2: Flexible, low-barrier policies remove traditional treatment obstacles including
  strict urinary toxicology requirements, photo ID requirements, and rigid eligibility
  criteria that typically exclude homeless populations'
- 'Step 3: Street-based inductions allow patients to initiate buprenorphine treatment
  on-site without requiring clinic visits, circumventing brick-and-mortar limitations'
- 'Step 4: Insurance assistance (Medicaid activation or county emergency funds) and
  pharmacy partnerships address financial and logistical barriers to medication access'
- 'Step 5: Regular scheduled visits to encampments and cell phone availability enable
  reliable follow-up and medication management, increasing treatment retention'
- 'Step 6: Harm reduction approach and nonjudgmental care framework increases patient
  trust and engagement, leading to higher rates of treatment initiation and continuation'

description: Mobile buprenorphine treatment programs increase OUD medication treatment
  rates among homeless populations by deploying clinical teams directly to encampments
  and removing traditional barriers to care. The program eliminates transportation,
  identification, and eligibility barriers while providing flexible, harm-reduction-oriented
  care that meets patients where they are physically and psychologically.
