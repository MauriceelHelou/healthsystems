- 'Step 1: Deprescribing interventions systematically review and reduce potentially
  inappropriate medications (PIMs) in older adults through structured protocols'
- 'Step 2: Reduction in polypharmacy decreases drug-drug interactions, adverse drug
  events, and medication burden'
- 'Step 3: Decreased adverse events and improved medication appropriateness leads
  to better functional status, reduced hospitalizations, and improved survival particularly
  in frail older populations'

description: Deprescribing interventions in older adults involve the systematic process
  of identifying and discontinuing potentially inappropriate medications to improve
  health outcomes. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes rapidly
  accumulating evidence suggesting that deprescribing can improve survival and other
  health outcomes, with particular benefits observed in frail older populations who
  are most vulnerable to medication-related harms.
