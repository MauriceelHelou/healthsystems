category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telemedicine programs are implemented in prison settings to overcome barriers
  of specialist access, security constraints, and geographic isolation of correctional
  facilities'
- 'Step 2: Remote consultations enable incarcerated individuals to receive specialist
  care for chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease)
  without requiring transport to external facilities'
- 'Step 3: Increased access to specialist consultations facilitates more timely diagnosis,
  treatment adjustments, and ongoing monitoring of chronic non-communicable diseases'
- 'Step 4: Improved monitoring and management leads to better clinical outcomes, medication
  adherence, and disease control among the prison population'

description: Telemedicine programs in prison settings improve chronic disease management
  by overcoming access barriers inherent to correctional environments. This systematic
  review of 65 studies involving 18,311 participants found that telemedicine was among
  several interventions associated with improvements in clinical and cost effectiveness
  measures for chronic non-communicable disease management. However, high clinical
  heterogeneity prevented direct comparison between different care models.
