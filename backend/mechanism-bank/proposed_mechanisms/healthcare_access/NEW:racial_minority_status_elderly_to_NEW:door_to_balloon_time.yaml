direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: African American and Hispanic elderly patients (65+) present with acute
  myocardial infarction requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)'
- 'Step 2: Racial minority patients experience systemic barriers including presentation
  to hospitals with fewer cardiac catheterization resources, implicit bias in triage
  decisions, and differential treatment prioritization'
- 'Step 3: These barriers result in delays in the recognition, diagnosis, and initiation
  of PCI procedures'
- 'Step 4: Consequently, door-to-balloon time is prolonged for African American and
  Hispanic elderly patients compared to White patients, contributing to worse cardiovascular
  outcomes'

description: This systematic review of 10 studies demonstrates that African American
  and Hispanic patients aged 65 and older experience longer door-to-balloon times
  during percutaneous coronary interventions compared to White patients. These disparities
  reflect systemic inequities in healthcare access and delivery, including differential
  hospital presentation patterns, potential implicit bias in clinical decision-making,
  and structural barriers to timely cardiac care. The prolonged door-to-balloon time
  contributes to worse clinical outcomes including higher mortality rates and increased
  major adverse cardiovascular events among racial minority elderly patients.
