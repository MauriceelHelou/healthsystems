- 'Step 1: Individuals with substance use disorders (alcohol, medication, or illicit
  drugs) enter inpatient treatment programs lasting more than 3 months, receiving
  intensive therapeutic intervention'
- 'Step 2: Extended inpatient treatment provides structured environment with comprehensive
  psychosocial support, therapy, and skill-building for coping behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Patients demonstrate improvements in mental health outcomes during and
  after treatment completion'
- 'Step 4: Treatment facilitates enhancement of perceived social support networks
  and potential improvements in employment status'
- 'Step 5: These combined psychosocial improvements constitute increased recovery
  capital, enabling better coping behavior and societal reintegration post-discharge'

description: Systematic review evidence indicates that inpatient substance use disorder
  treatment lasting more than 3 months leads to positive changes in psychosocial factors
  that constitute recovery capital. Specifically, patients demonstrate overall progress
  in mental health, potential improvements in employment status, and enhanced perceived
  social support from admission to follow-up after discharge. These improvements in
  recovery capital facilitate coping behavior and successful reintegration into society.
  However, evidence on self-efficacy, housing, education, and quality of life outcomes
  was limited in the literature.
