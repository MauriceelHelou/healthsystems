mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: TORS provides minimally invasive transoral access to head and neck tumors,
  avoiding external incisions and tissue disruption associated with traditional open
  surgical approaches'
- 'Step 2: The robotic platform enables precise dissection in previously irradiated
  fields with enhanced visualization and instrument articulation, reducing collateral
  tissue damage'
- 'Step 3: Reduced surgical invasiveness leads to shorter tracheostomy dependence
  (mean 9.7 days to decannulation) and nasogastric tube dependence (mean 12.8 days),
  with only 0-11.5% requiring long-term tracheostomy'
- 'Step 4: Overall complication rate of 32.3% is achieved, with 92% of complications
  being lower severity (Clavien-Dindo grade 2-3), representing decreased morbidity
  compared to traditional open salvage techniques'

description: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for salvage treatment of recurrent,
  residual, or second primary head and neck cancers in previously irradiated fields
  demonstrates reduced surgical morbidity compared to traditional open techniques.
  This systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies with 515 patients showed
  a pooled complication rate of 32.3%, with the majority (92%) being low-severity
  complications. Functional outcomes showed rapid recovery with mean tracheostomy
  decannulation at 9.7 days and nasogastric tube removal at 12.8 days, with minimal
  long-term feeding tube or tracheostomy dependence.
