direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular caffeinated coffee consumption delivers bioactive compounds including
  chlorogenic acids, caffeine, and other polyphenols to the body'
- 'Step 2: These compounds exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, reducing
  oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in vascular tissues'
- 'Step 3: Coffee bioactives improve endothelial function, reduce arterial stiffness,
  and modulate lipid metabolism favorably'
- 'Step 4: These cardiovascular protective effects lead to reduced atherosclerosis
  progression and lower risk of cardiovascular events'
- 'Step 5: The cumulative protective effects result in decreased cardiovascular disease
  mortality, with optimal benefit observed at 3-4 cups per day'

description: 'Caffeinated coffee consumption is inversely associated with cardiovascular
  disease mortality. A meta-analysis of 26 prospective studies with over 3.7 million
  participants found that any coffee consumption compared to no consumption was associated
  with a 10% reduction in CVD risk (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96). The relationship
  follows a nonlinear dose-response pattern, with optimal protective effects observed
  at 3-4 cups per day. Current US consumption patterns would account for approximately
  6-12% of avoided cardiovascular deaths.'
