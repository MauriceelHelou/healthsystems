    Intervention
to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Motivational interviewing enhances intrinsic motivation to change drinking
  behavior by resolving ambivalence and strengthening commitment to reduce alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive-behavioural therapy identifies and modifies maladaptive thought
  patterns and beliefs that maintain problematic drinking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: CBT teaches coping skills and alternative behavioral strategies to manage
  triggers, cravings, and high-risk situations without alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: The combined approach addresses comorbid depression symptoms, which often
  co-occur with and maintain alcohol use disorder, creating synergistic treatment
  effects'
- 'Step 5: Sustained engagement with therapeutic techniques leads to measurable reductions
  in alcohol consumption compared to usual care'

description: 'Combined cognitive-behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing
  produces a small but clinically significant reduction in alcohol consumption among
  individuals with comorbid alcohol use disorder and depression. The meta-analysis
  of 12 studies with 1721 patients found a Hedges'' g of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07-0.28)
  for decreased alcohol consumption compared to usual care. The intervention works
  through enhancing motivation to change via MI techniques while simultaneously providing
  CBT-based skills to modify drinking-related cognitions and behaviors.'
