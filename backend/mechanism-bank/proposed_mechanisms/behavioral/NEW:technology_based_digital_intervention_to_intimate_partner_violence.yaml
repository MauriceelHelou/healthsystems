to_node:
  node_id: intimate_partner_violence
  node_name: Intimate Partner Violence
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Technology-based digital interventions (apps, websites, telehealth platforms)
  provide IPV survivors with accessible, private, and on-demand resources for safety
  planning, education, and support'
- 'Step 2: These interventions increase survivor knowledge of IPV dynamics, available
  resources, and safety behaviors while reducing barriers to help-seeking (stigma,
  time, transportation, privacy concerns)'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced self-efficacy and decision-making skills enable survivors to implement
  safety strategies, access support services, and make informed choices about their
  relationships'
- 'Step 4: Improved mental health outcomes (reduced depression and anxiety) from intervention
  components strengthen survivors'' capacity to engage in protective behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects lead to measurable reductions in physical and psychological
  violence victimization among IPV survivors'

description: A meta-analysis of 17 RCTs with 4590 female IPV survivors demonstrates
  that technology-based digital interventions significantly reduce physical violence
  victimization (SMD = -0.22) and psychological violence victimization (SMD = -0.34)
  over 0-6 month periods. These interventions also improve mental health outcomes
  including depression and anxiety in the short term. The interventions work through
  multiple pathways including increased accessibility, privacy, safety planning support,
  and enhanced self-efficacy. However, digital interventions did not significantly
  reduce sexual violence victimization or PTSD symptoms.
