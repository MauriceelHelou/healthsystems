direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking episodes result in acute alcohol intoxication with blood
  alcohol concentrations that impair cognitive function and motor coordination'
- 'Step 2: Impaired judgment, reduced reaction time, and compromised physical coordination
  increase risk-taking behaviors and decrease ability to avoid hazards'
- 'Step 3: These impairments during and after binge drinking episodes lead to increased
  incidence of injuries including falls, motor vehicle accidents, violence, and other
  trauma'

description: Binge drinking directly increases the prevalence of alcohol-related injuries
  through acute intoxication effects that impair judgment, coordination, and reaction
  time. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that reducing binge drinking through
  text message interventions resulted in significantly lower alcohol-related injury
  prevalence (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.88), providing causal evidence that binge drinking
  is a modifiable risk factor for injury.

    reduce alcohol-related injury prevalence, suggesting behavioral interventions
    can moderate this relationship
