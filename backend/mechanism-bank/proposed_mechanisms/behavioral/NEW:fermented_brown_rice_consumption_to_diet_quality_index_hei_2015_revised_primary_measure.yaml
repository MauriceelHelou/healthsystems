direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fermentation of brown rice enhances nutritional bioavailability by improving
  protein digestibility and mineral availability compared to unfermented brown rice
  or white rice'
- 'Step 2: Fermentation releases beneficial peptides, amino acids, and increases antioxidant
  and antibacterial activity, creating a more nutrient-dense food product'
- 'Step 3: Consumption of fermented brown rice as a dietary staple displaces refined
  grains (white rice) that are high glycemic index and low in nutrients'
- 'Step 4: Regular inclusion of fermented whole grain brown rice in the diet increases
  whole grain intake and overall nutrient density, key components of diet quality
  indices like HEI-2015'

description: Fermented brown rice consumption improves diet quality through enhanced
  nutritional bioavailability from the fermentation process, which increases protein
  digestibility, mineral availability, and antioxidant content. By replacing refined
  white rice with nutrient-dense fermented whole grain brown rice, individuals increase
  whole grain intake and overall dietary nutrient density, positively impacting diet
  quality scores.
