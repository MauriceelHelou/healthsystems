  node_name: Alcohol-Associated Cirrhosis Prevalence
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) engage in chronic, heavy alcohol
  consumption that exceeds safe drinking thresholds'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol exposure causes progressive hepatocyte damage through
  oxidative stress, acetaldehyde toxicity, and inflammatory cascades'
- 'Step 3: Repeated liver injury leads to fibrogenesis as hepatic stellate cells become
  activated and deposit excess collagen'
- 'Step 4: Sustained fibrotic processes result in architectural distortion and nodule
  formation characteristic of cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: The cumulative effect of chronic alcohol exposure in AUD dramatically elevates
  cirrhosis prevalence compared to general populations'

description: 'Alcohol use disorder is strongly associated with alcohol-associated
  cirrhosis prevalence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies (n=513,278)
  found that individuals with AUD have dramatically elevated cirrhosis prevalence
  (12.9%, 95% CI: 4.3%-33.2%) compared to general populations (0.3%) and primary care
  settings (1.7%). This represents approximately a 43-fold higher prevalence in AUD
  populations versus the general population, establishing AUD as a critical risk factor
  for cirrhosis development.'
