direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dietary intervention replaces saturated fat with vegetable oils rich in
  linoleic acid (corn oil, polyunsaturated margarine)'
- 'Step 2: Serum cholesterol levels significantly decrease (mean reduction ~13.8%
  vs 1.0% in controls)'
- 'Step 3: Despite cholesterol reduction, no mortality benefit is observed; instead
  a 22% higher risk of death is found per 30 mg/dL reduction in serum cholesterol'
- 'Step 4: No evidence of benefit for coronary atherosclerosis or myocardial infarcts
  at autopsy, suggesting cholesterol lowering via this mechanism does not translate
  to cardiovascular benefit'
- 'Step 5: Potential mechanisms for harm may include oxidative susceptibility of linoleic
  acid, inflammatory pathways, or other unmeasured effects of high polyunsaturated
  fat intake'

description: Replacement of saturated fat with linoleic acid-rich vegetable oils effectively
  lowers serum cholesterol but does not reduce and may potentially increase all-cause
  mortality risk. The Minnesota Coronary Experiment and systematic review of 5 RCTs
  (total n=10,808) found no evidence of mortality benefit despite significant cholesterol
  reduction. Per-unit cholesterol reduction was paradoxically associated with increased
  mortality risk (HR 1.22 per 30 mg/dL reduction). This challenges the traditional
  diet-heart hypothesis and suggests that not all cholesterol-lowering dietary interventions
  translate to reduced mortality.
