direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CBT component targets maladaptive thought patterns and cognitive distortions
  associated with depression, teaching patients to identify and challenge negative
  automatic thoughts'
- 'Step 2: Motivational Interviewing enhances intrinsic motivation for behavior change
  and treatment engagement, addressing ambivalence about recovery'
- 'Step 3: Combined intervention addresses the bidirectional relationship between
  alcohol use and depression, as reduced alcohol consumption removes a depressogenic
  factor'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral activation components increase engagement in rewarding activities,
  counteracting withdrawal and anhedonia'
- 'Step 5: Skills acquisition (coping strategies, emotion regulation) provides lasting
  tools for managing depressive symptoms'

description: Combined CBT and motivational interviewing produces a small but clinically
  significant reduction in depressive symptoms (g=0.27) among individuals with comorbid
  alcohol use disorders and major depression. The intervention works by simultaneously
  addressing cognitive distortions, enhancing motivation for change, and breaking
  the cycle between alcohol misuse and depression. Digital delivery formats may enhance
  effectiveness for depression outcomes.
