direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol relapse occurs in approximately 26.3% of liver transplant recipients
  for alcoholic cirrhosis, with an annual relapse rate of 4.7% for any alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Continued alcohol consumption causes direct hepatotoxic damage to the transplanted
  liver graft, leading to progressive histological changes including steatosis (4.1x
  higher odds), steatohepatitis (4.5x higher odds), and alcoholic hepatitis (9.3x
  higher odds)'
- 'Step 3: Progressive liver damage advances to fibrosis and recurrent cirrhosis (8.4x
  higher odds), with recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis occurring in 9% of biopsied patients'
- 'Step 4: Recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis accounts for approximately 20% of all deaths
  post-transplant, while alcohol''s systemic effects also increase risk of extra-hepatic
  malignancy and cardiovascular events'
- 'Step 5: These combined effects result in significantly increased 10-year mortality
  among relapsers compared to abstainers'

description: Alcohol relapse after liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis significantly
  increases 10-year mortality risk. This meta-analysis of 7 studies found relapsers
  were 3.67 times more likely to die at 10-year follow-up compared to abstainers.
  The mechanism operates through direct hepatotoxic effects causing progressive graft
  damage (steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and recurrent cirrhosis) as well as
  increased risk of extra-hepatic malignancy and cardiovascular events. Recurrent
  alcoholic cirrhosis was responsible for approximately 20% of all deaths. Notably,
  survival differences were not apparent at 5 years, suggesting cumulative long-term
  damage is the primary driver of excess mortality.
