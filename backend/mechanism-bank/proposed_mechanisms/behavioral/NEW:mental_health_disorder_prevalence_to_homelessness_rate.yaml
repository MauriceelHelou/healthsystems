mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mental health disorders impair cognitive functioning, decision-making,
  and ability to maintain employment, reducing income stability and financial resources'
- 'Step 2: Symptoms of mental health disorders (including substance use disorders,
  depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) compromise capacity to maintain social
  relationships and support networks that could prevent housing loss'
- 'Step 3: Behavioral manifestations of untreated mental disorders may lead to conflicts
  with landlords, family members, or roommates, resulting in eviction or loss of housing
  arrangements'
- 'Step 4: Mental health disorders create barriers to navigating housing systems,
  completing applications, and meeting tenancy requirements, increasing vulnerability
  to housing instability'
- 'Step 5: Lack of coordinated mental health, social, and housing services results
  in individuals with mental disorders falling through gaps in the social safety net,
  culminating in homelessness'

description: Mental health disorders substantially increase the risk of experiencing
  homelessness through multiple pathways including impaired functioning, reduced employment
  capacity, compromised social relationships, and barriers to navigating housing systems.
  The meta-analysis found that 67% of people experiencing homelessness have current
  mental health disorders and 77% have lifetime prevalence, far exceeding general
  population rates. This bidirectional relationship is acknowledged, where homelessness
  may also exacerbate mental health conditions, but the high prevalence of pre-existing
  disorders indicates mental health as a significant driver of housing instability.
