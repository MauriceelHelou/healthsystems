direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receive education on carbohydrate
  counting techniques to estimate carbohydrate content in meals'
- 'Step 2: Carbohydrate counting enables more precise calculation of meal-related
  insulin doses matched to actual carbohydrate intake'
- 'Step 3: Improved insulin-to-carbohydrate matching leads to better postprandial
  glucose control while allowing dietary flexibility'
- 'Step 4: Sustained improvements in daily glucose management result in reduced glycated
  hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels over time'

description: Carbohydrate counting is an efficacious dietary technique that reduces
  HbA1c in adults and children with type 1 diabetes compared to standard diabetes
  education. The meta-analysis of 11 RCTs (n=899) found a meaningful reduction in
  HbA1c (SMD -0.52%, 95%CI -0.82 to -0.23) when excluding highly heterogeneous studies.
  The intervention allows patients to calculate insulin doses based on carbohydrate
  intake, enabling better glycemic control without increasing hypoglycemia risk, body
  weight, or adverse effects on blood lipids.
