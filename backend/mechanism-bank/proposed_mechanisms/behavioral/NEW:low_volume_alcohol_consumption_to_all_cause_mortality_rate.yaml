direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low volume alcohol consumption (defined as >1.3g to <25g ethanol/day, or
  roughly 1 drink/week to 2 drinks/day) was historically associated with reduced mortality
  in epidemiological studies'
- 'Step 2: However, this apparent protective effect is largely attributable to methodological
  biases, particularly ''abstainer bias'' where former drinkers and occasional drinkers
  with pre-existing health conditions are misclassified as abstainers in the reference
  group'
- 'Step 3: When higher-quality studies control for these biases (younger cohorts ≤55
  years, excluding former/occasional drinkers from abstainer groups, following up
  beyond age 55), the apparent mortality benefit disappears'
- 'Step 4: In non-smoking cohorts specifically, low volume alcohol consumption shows
  elevated mortality risk (RR=1.16), indicating alcohol itself may increase mortality
  when confounding by smoking is removed'
- 'Step 5: Direct biological effects of alcohol (even at low doses) including oxidative
  stress, inflammatory responses, and organ toxicity contribute to increased mortality
  risk without the masking effect of methodological biases'

description: Two comprehensive meta-analyses (totaling 194 cohort studies, ~4.8 million
  participants, ~425,000 deaths) demonstrate that the historically observed J-shaped
  relationship between alcohol and mortality is an artifact of methodological biases.
  When studies properly exclude former and occasional drinkers from abstainer reference
  groups and control for confounders like smoking and socioeconomic status, low volume
  alcohol consumption shows no mortality benefit (RR=0.97-0.98) compared to lifetime
  abstention. In non-smoking cohorts, low volume drinking is associated with elevated
  mortality risk (RR=1.16). This evidence supports a positive (harmful) direction
  of effect for low volume alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality.
