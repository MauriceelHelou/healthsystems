direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption characteristic of Alcohol Use Disorder
  leads to sustained hepatic exposure to ethanol and its metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol metabolism in the liver produces acetaldehyde and generates reactive
  oxygen species, causing direct hepatocyte injury and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Repeated hepatic injury triggers inflammatory responses including steatosis
  (fatty liver), necroinflammation, and progressive fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Continued alcohol exposure in individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder prevents
  liver recovery and promotes development of alcoholic hepatitis, typically manifesting
  between ages 40-50'

description: Alcohol Use Disorder, characterized by chronic heavy alcohol consumption,
  is a direct causal factor for alcoholic hepatitis. This form of alcoholic liver
  disease is defined by steatosis, necroinflammation, fibrosis, and hepatic complications.
  The condition typically develops after years of heavy drinking, manifesting between
  ages 40-50. While abstinence can lead to resolution, continued alcohol use perpetuates
  liver damage. The severity of alcoholic hepatitis, measured by Maddrey's discriminant
  function score, determines prognosis and risk of mortality.
