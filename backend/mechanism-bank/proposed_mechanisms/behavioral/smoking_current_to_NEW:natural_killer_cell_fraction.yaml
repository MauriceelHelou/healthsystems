direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current smoking introduces toxic compounds including nicotine, carbon monoxide,
  and reactive oxidative species into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 2: These compounds create systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses
  that affect immune cell populations'
- 'Step 3: Chronic smoking-induced inflammation and immunosuppressive effects lead
  to decreased natural killer cell counts and/or impaired NK cell maturation'
- 'Step 4: Reduced NK cell fractions compromise innate immune surveillance capacity
  against infections and malignancies'

description: This large-scale meta-analysis of 22 cohorts comprising 23,053 blood
  samples used high-resolution DNA methylation profiling to estimate immune cell fractions.
  The study found that current smoking is associated with decreased natural killer
  cell fractions in blood. This finding was validated with single-cell RNA sequencing
  data. The reduction in NK cells among smokers may contribute to impaired immune
  surveillance and increased susceptibility to infections and malignancies.
