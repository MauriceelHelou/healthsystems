direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression is associated with emotional dysregulation, irritability, and
  reduced impulse control, which may increase vulnerability to engaging in aggressive
  behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Depression often co-occurs with experiencing IPV victimization, particularly
  among women, creating a bidirectional violence dynamic where victimization mediates
  the relationship between depression and perpetration'
- 'Step 3: The combination of depressive symptoms and ongoing relationship conflict
  leads to increased risk of physical intimate partner violence perpetration, with
  effects observed in both sexes but stronger in women'

description: Depression is associated with increased risk of intimate partner violence
  perpetration in both men and women. This IPD meta-mediation analysis of four general
  population surveys found that depression was associated with a 7.4% proportion increase
  in past-year physical IPV perpetration among women and 4.8% among men. Importantly,
  alcohol misuse did not mediate this relationship. However, among women, past-year
  IPV victimization was a significant mediator, accounting for 45% of the total effect,
  suggesting bidirectional violence dynamics play a key role in the depression-perpetration
  pathway.
