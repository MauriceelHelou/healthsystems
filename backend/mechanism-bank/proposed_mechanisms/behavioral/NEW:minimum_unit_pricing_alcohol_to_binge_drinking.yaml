to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Heavy Alcohol Consumption
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing (MUP) establishes a legally required floor price per
  unit of alcohol, directly increasing the cost of cheap, high-strength alcoholic
  beverages'
- 'Step 2: Price increases disproportionately affect the cheapest alcohol products
  typically purchased by heavy drinkers, as these products previously sold below the
  minimum price threshold'
- 'Step 3: Heavy consumers, who tend to purchase larger quantities of cheap alcohol,
  face the greatest relative price increase and economic barrier to maintaining consumption
  levels'
- 'Step 4: The price elasticity of demand leads heavy drinkers to reduce consumption
  volume, as the financial cost of maintaining high consumption becomes prohibitive'
- 'Step 5: Reduced heavy alcohol consumption manifests as decreased alcohol-related
  hospital admissions, with acute effects appearing immediately and chronic effects
  following 2-3 years later'

description: Minimum unit pricing reduces heavy alcohol consumption by establishing
  a floor price that disproportionately increases costs for cheap, high-strength alcohol
  preferred by heavy drinkers. This systematic review of 22 studies (6 natural experiments
  and 16 modelling studies) found that MUP reduces alcohol-related hospital admissions
  by 2-10% annually, with the policy specifically targeting the heaviest consumers.
  The Bradford Hill Criteria analysis inferred a 'moderate-to-strong' causal link
  between MUP and reduced alcohol-related harm.
