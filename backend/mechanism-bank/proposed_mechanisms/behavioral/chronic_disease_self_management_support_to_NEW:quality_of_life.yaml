- 'Step 1: Patients with chronic diseases receive structured self-management interventions
  including education, skill-building, and support'
- 'Step 2: These interventions enhance self-efficacy, empowering patients to actively
  manage their conditions and health behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Improved self-management leads to better disease control, reduced depressive
  symptoms, and enhanced adaptation to disease-related changes'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative effect of better disease management and psychological well-being
  results in significantly improved quality of life'

description: Self-management interventions for chronic diseases significantly improve
  quality of life compared to usual care. This meta-analysis of 34 studies involving
  7,603 patients demonstrated that self-management support enhances quality of life
  through multiple pathways including improved self-efficacy and reduced depressive
  symptoms. The effect was more pronounced in older adults (>60 years) and with longer
  follow-up periods (>6 months), suggesting that sustained engagement with self-management
  strategies yields greater benefits for quality of life outcomes.
