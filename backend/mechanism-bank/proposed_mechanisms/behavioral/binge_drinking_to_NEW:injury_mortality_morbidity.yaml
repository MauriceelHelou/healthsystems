direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption leads to elevated blood alcohol concentration (BAC),
  which impairs cognitive function, motor coordination, reaction time, and judgment'
- 'Step 2: Impaired psychomotor and cognitive abilities increase the likelihood of
  accidents, falls, motor vehicle crashes, and risk-taking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: These alcohol-impaired states result in increased incidence of both intentional
  and unintentional injuries'
- 'Step 4: Higher severity and frequency of injuries lead to increased injury-related
  mortality and morbidity across multiple ICD-10 categories'

description: This systematic review of 255 reviews and meta-analyses establishes that
  alcohol use is causally linked to injury mortality and morbidity. Blood alcohol
  concentration is identified as the most critical dimension of alcohol exposure for
  injury outcomes (except suicide). The relationship is dose-responsive, with higher
  alcohol consumption leading to greater injury risk. More than 40 ICD-10 three-digit
  categories are fully attributable to alcohol, with injuries representing a major
  category of alcohol-related harm.
