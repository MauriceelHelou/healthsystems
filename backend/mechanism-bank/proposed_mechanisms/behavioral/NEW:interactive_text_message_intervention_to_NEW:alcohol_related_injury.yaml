direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults receive weekly Thursday text messages querying weekend drinking
  plans and prompting commitment to drinking limit goals'
- 'Step 2: Sunday text messages query actual weekend drinking quantity, providing
  opportunity for self-reflection and accountability'
- 'Step 3: Participants receive tailored feedback based on their responses, reinforcing
  goal-setting and behavioral change'
- 'Step 4: The intervention reduces binge drinking frequency (IRR 0.69) and drinks
  per drinking day, lowering overall alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Reduced alcohol consumption leads to fewer episodes of intoxication and
  impaired judgment'
- 'Step 6: Lower rates of intoxication result in decreased prevalence of alcohol-related
  injuries (OR 0.42)'

description: A 12-week interactive text message intervention combining weekly drinking
  assessments with tailored feedback significantly reduces alcohol-related injury
  prevalence in young adults. The intervention prompts goal-setting for weekend drinking
  limits and provides personalized feedback based on reported consumption, leading
  to sustained reductions in binge drinking behavior and consequently fewer alcohol-related
  injuries up to 6 months post-intervention.
