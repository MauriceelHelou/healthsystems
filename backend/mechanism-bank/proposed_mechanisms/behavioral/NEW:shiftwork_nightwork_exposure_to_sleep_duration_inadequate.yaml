direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Shiftwork and nightwork schedules require workers to be active during normal
  sleep periods, disrupting the natural circadian rhythm'
- 'Step 2: Working during nighttime hours forces sleep to occur during daytime when
  environmental and biological factors are less conducive to sleep'
- 'Step 3: Irregular and rotating shift schedules prevent establishment of consistent
  sleep-wake patterns, fragmenting and reducing total sleep time'
- 'Step 4: Shiftworkers experience difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep,
  resulting in shorter overall sleep duration compared to dayworkers'

description: Shiftwork disrupts the natural circadian rhythm by requiring wakefulness
  during normal sleep periods and sleep during suboptimal times. This systematic review
  confirms that shiftworkers sleep less than dayworkers, with 20-40% experiencing
  difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. The irregular scheduling inherent
  to shiftwork, especially night and rotating shifts, prevents the establishment of
  consistent sleep patterns, leading to chronic inadequate sleep duration.
