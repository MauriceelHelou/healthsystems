direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare professionals experience chronic exposure to high-pressure and
  demanding work environments, including long hours, high patient loads, and emotional
  strain'
- 'Step 2: These occupational stressors create psychological distress and emotional
  exhaustion that require coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare workers adopt alcohol consumption as a maladaptive coping strategy
  to manage work-related stress and trauma'
- 'Step 4: This coping pattern progresses to hazardous drinking levels, with approximately
  one-fifth of healthcare professionals meeting criteria for hazardous alcohol use'

description: High-pressure healthcare work environments are associated with hazardous
  alcohol use among healthcare professionals, with approximately one-fifth (19.98%)
  drinking at hazardous levels. Healthcare workers use alcohol as a coping strategy
  for occupational stress and trauma. This relationship was more pronounced during
  the COVID-19 pandemic when additional stressors intensified the work environment
  pressures.
