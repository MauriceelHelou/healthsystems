direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Eating disorders involve maladaptive coping mechanisms for emotional regulation,
  including restriction, bingeing, and purging behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with eating disorders experience high levels of psychological
  distress, negative affect, and difficulties with emotion regulation'
- 'Step 3: Non-suicidal self-injury serves as an alternative maladaptive coping mechanism
  for managing overwhelming emotions and psychological pain'
- 'Step 4: Shared underlying factors (impulsivity, negative self-perception, dissociation)
  facilitate the co-occurrence of eating disorders and NSSI'
- 'Step 5: The comorbidity results in a 40% prevalence of NSSI among individuals with
  eating disorders'

description: This meta-analysis of 52 studies demonstrates a strong association between
  eating disorders and non-suicidal self-injury, with 40% prevalence of NSSI among
  individuals with eating disorders. The high comorbidity suggests shared etiological
  mechanisms related to emotional dysregulation, maladaptive coping, and self-directed
  harm behaviors.
