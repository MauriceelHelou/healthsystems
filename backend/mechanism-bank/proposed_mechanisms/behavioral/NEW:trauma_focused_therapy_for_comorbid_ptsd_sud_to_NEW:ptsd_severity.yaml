direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Trauma-focused therapy (e.g., trauma-focused CBT) directly addresses traumatic
  memories and associated cognitions through exposure and cognitive processing techniques'
- 'Step 2: Processing of trauma memories reduces avoidance behaviors and emotional
  reactivity to trauma-related cues, which are core maintaining factors in PTSD'
- 'Step 3: Integrated treatment addresses the bidirectional relationship between PTSD
  symptoms and substance use, preventing substance use from interfering with trauma
  processing'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in PTSD symptom severity occurs both immediately post-treatment
  and is maintained at 6-13 month follow-up'

description: Trauma-focused therapy for individuals with comorbid PTSD and substance
  use disorder produces modest but significant reductions in PTSD severity compared
  to SUD-only interventions. The meta-analysis of 27 studies found that trauma-focused
  interventions combined with SUD treatment reduced PTSD symptoms both post-treatment
  (SMD=-0.36) and at follow-up (SMD=-0.48), with integrated CBT also showing specific
  benefits. Present-focused coping skills approaches did not show added benefit over
  standard addiction treatments.
