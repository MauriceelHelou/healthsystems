direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experience intimate partner violence victimisation, which creates
  psychological distress and trauma responses'
- 'Step 2: Victimisation may trigger defensive or retaliatory behaviors within the
  relationship dynamic, particularly among women'
- 'Step 3: The bidirectional nature of IPV in some relationships means victimisation
  and perpetration become interlinked behavioral patterns'
- 'Step 4: Past-year IPV victimisation mediates a substantial portion (45-60%) of
  the relationship between depression and IPV perpetration, particularly among women'

description: IPV victimisation is strongly associated with IPV perpetration, with
  victimisation mediating nearly half of the depression-perpetration relationship
  among women. This suggests bidirectional violence patterns in intimate relationships
  where victims may also engage in perpetration, potentially as defensive or retaliatory
  behavior.
