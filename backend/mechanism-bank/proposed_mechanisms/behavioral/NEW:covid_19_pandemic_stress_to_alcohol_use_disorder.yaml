direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates multiple stressors including mortality/grief,
  social isolation, economic hardship, job loss, and prolonged uncertainty'
- 'Step 2: Stay-at-home orders, quarantine, and social disruption limit access to
  social support and coping resources while increasing psychological distress'
- 'Step 3: Individuals use alcohol as a maladaptive coping mechanism to manage stress,
  leading to increased consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Sustained heavy drinking and high-risk drinking behaviors develop or worsen,
  particularly among those with pre-existing vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 5: Progression to alcohol use disorder occurs, with relapse among previously
  abstinent individuals and new onset cases in vulnerable populations'

description: COVID-19 pandemic-related stress increases risk of alcohol use disorder
  through multiple pathways. The pandemic's unique characteristics—extensive population
  exposure to ongoing trauma, widespread mortality and grief, social isolation, economic
  hardship, and prolonged uncertainty—create conditions favorable to using alcohol
  as a coping mechanism. Meta-analytic evidence from 31 studies of mass traumatic
  events indicates 7.3% of populations increase alcohol consumption within two years,
  with 20% probability of rates reaching 14%. COVID-19's prolonged duration and scope
  exceed typical disasters. Studies from Australia (N=4,462) found 30.8% drank 'a
  lot more than normal' during the pandemic, with social isolation identified as a
  risk factor for both increased consumption and relapse.
