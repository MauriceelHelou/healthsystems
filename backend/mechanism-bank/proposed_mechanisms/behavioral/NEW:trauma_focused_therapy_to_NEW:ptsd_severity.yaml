direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Trauma-focused behavioral therapy provides structured exposure to trauma
  memories and trauma-related stimuli in a safe therapeutic environment'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure facilitates habituation to trauma cues and reduces conditioned
  fear responses through extinction learning'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive restructuring components help patients process and reframe maladaptive
  trauma-related cognitions and beliefs'
- 'Step 4: Integration of traumatic memories into autobiographical memory reduces
  intrusive symptoms and hyperarousal'
- 'Step 5: Reduced avoidance behaviors and improved emotional regulation lead to decreased
  overall PTSD symptom severity'

description: Trauma-focused behavioral therapies significantly reduce PTSD symptom
  severity through structured exposure, cognitive restructuring, and emotional processing
  of traumatic memories. This meta-analysis of 36 trials with individual patient data
  demonstrated large effect sizes (d=-0.92) for trauma-focused approaches, with the
  strongest effects observed when combined with pharmacotherapy for comorbid substance
  use disorders. Both integrated and non-integrated trauma-focused therapies showed
  reductions in PTSD symptoms, with effects sustained at 12-month follow-up.
