direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Achieving abstinence or substantial reduction in alcohol consumption represents
  the primary behavioral outcome goal in AUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Sustained abstinence or reduced drinking interrupts the cycle of alcohol
  dependence and physiological addiction'
- 'Step 3: Breaking the drinking pattern allows for neurobiological recovery and reduces
  craving intensity over time'
- 'Step 4: Continued abstinence or controlled drinking leads to remission of alcohol
  use disorder diagnostic criteria'

description: 'This meta-analysis examined the relationship between achieving alcohol
  abstinence or substantial reduction in drinking and alcohol use disorder outcomes
  in the context of psychedelic-assisted treatment. Across 6 controlled trials, psychedelic
  therapy enhanced the odds of patients achieving abstinence or substantial reduction
  in drinking by 89% (OR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.42-2.50). The pathway represents the direct
  behavioral intervention target - achieving and maintaining reduced alcohol consumption
  - as the means by which AUD is addressed. However, methodological limitations including
  high risk of bias in most studies and the historical nature of LSD research temper
  the strength of conclusions.'
