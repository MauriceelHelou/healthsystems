  node_id: chronic_pain
  node_name: Chronic Pain Severity
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabinoids (THC and CBD) are administered via various routes (oral, sublingual,
  topical, inhaled) to patients with chronic pain conditions'
- 'Step 2: Cannabinoids interact with the endocannabinoid system, modulating pain
  signaling pathways, particularly effective in neuropathic pain conditions'
- 'Step 3: THC-containing products (comparable THC-to-CBD ratio ~1:1 and synthetic
  high-THC products) produce small improvements in pain severity'
- 'Step 4: CBD provides additional benefits through its non-intoxicating analgesic
  and anti-inflammatory properties with minimal adverse effects'
- 'Step 5: Some patients successfully substitute cannabinoids for other pain medications
  including opioids, reducing overall pain medication burden'

description: Cannabinoid use for chronic pain is associated with small improvements
  in pain severity, primarily demonstrated in chronic neuropathic pain conditions.
  THC-containing products (comparable THC-to-CBD ratio and synthetic high-THC) show
  the most consistent evidence for pain reduction, though with increased risk of sedation
  and dizziness. CBD offers a safer starting point with minimal adverse effects. Clinical
  guidance suggests CBD doses of 5-10mg twice daily increasing to 40-50mg daily, and
  THC doses starting at 0.5-3mg (initially at night) increasing to 30-40mg daily.
  Some patients may substitute cannabis for opioid medications, potentially improving
  risk-benefit profiles.
