direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-dependent individuals reduce their alcohol consumption levels through
  intervention, treatment, or behavioral change'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol intake decreases acute toxic effects on multiple organ
  systems including liver, cardiovascular system, and nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption reduces risk of alcohol-related accidents, injuries,
  and acute health events'
- 'Step 4: Chronic disease progression (cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, pancreatitis) is
  slowed or halted'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative reduction in physiological damage and acute risk events leads
  to significantly lower all-cause mortality risk'

description: This meta-analysis of 39 observational studies demonstrates that alcohol-dependent
  individuals have 3.45 times higher mortality risk compared to the general population.
  Critically, the study shows that reducing alcohol consumption significantly lowers
  this mortality risk, even among those who do not achieve complete abstinence. The
  protective effect of reduction operates through decreased physiological damage to
  multiple organ systems and reduced risk of acute alcohol-related events.
