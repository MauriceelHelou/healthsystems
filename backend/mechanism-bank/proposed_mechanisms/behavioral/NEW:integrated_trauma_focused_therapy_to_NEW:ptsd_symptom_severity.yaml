direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated trauma-focused therapy directly addresses traumatic memories
  and trauma-related cognitions while simultaneously targeting substance use behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Processing of traumatic experiences reduces avoidance behaviors and emotional
  numbing that often drive both PTSD symptoms and substance use as a coping mechanism'
- 'Step 3: Concurrent treatment of both conditions prevents the negative reinforcement
  cycle where untreated PTSD symptoms trigger substance use and vice versa'
- 'Step 4: Skills learned in integrated therapy (emotion regulation, distress tolerance)
  reduce hyperarousal and re-experiencing symptoms characteristic of PTSD'
- 'Step 5: Reduced PTSD symptom severity is achieved through the synergistic effect
  of addressing both conditions simultaneously rather than sequentially'

description: Network meta-analysis of 24 RCTs demonstrates that integrated trauma-focused
  therapy for comorbid PTSD and alcohol/other drug use disorders significantly reduces
  PTSD symptom severity compared to other treatment approaches. The therapy shows
  superior effectiveness over integrated non-trauma-focused therapy, AOD-focused psychotherapy
  alone, and control psychotherapies, with effect sizes ranging from SMD=-0.29 to
  -0.43.
