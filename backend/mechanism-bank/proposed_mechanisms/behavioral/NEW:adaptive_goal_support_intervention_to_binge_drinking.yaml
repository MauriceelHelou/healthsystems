direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adaptive goal support intervention delivers automated text messages on
  typical drinking days (2 days/week) that help participants set personalized drinking
  limit goals'
- 'Step 2: Goal-setting prompts activate self-regulatory processes including commitment
  to specific behavioral targets and increased awareness of consumption relative to
  goals'
- 'Step 3: Real-time goal support facilitates behavioral self-monitoring and provides
  accountability during high-risk drinking occasions'
- 'Step 4: Repeated engagement with goal-focused messages strengthens self-efficacy
  and develops skills for limiting alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative behavioral practice results in sustained reduction in binge
  drinking episodes over 3-6 months'

description: Adaptive goal support delivered via automated text messages reduces binge
  drinking days among non-treatment seeking young adults with hazardous drinking.
  The intervention involves personalized goal-setting prompts delivered on typical
  drinking days, helping participants self-regulate alcohol consumption. At 3 months,
  the GOAL intervention reduced mean binge drinking days from 3.0 to 2.6 compared
  to an increase from 2.7 to 3.4 in the control condition, with effects remaining
  significant at 6 months.
