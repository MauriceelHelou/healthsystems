direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients presenting to general medical settings (primary care, hospitals)
  are screened for substance use and identified as using illicit drugs'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions are delivered by healthcare providers, typically involving
  motivational interviewing, personalized feedback, and goal-setting around drug use
  reduction'
- 'Step 3: The intervention increases patient awareness of drug use patterns and associated
  health risks within a trusted medical context'
- 'Step 4: Patients develop increased motivation for behavior change through reflective
  dialogue and non-judgmental support'
- 'Step 5: Small but significant reductions in multiple drug/mixed substance use occur,
  particularly when delivered by general practitioners'

description: Brief drug interventions delivered in general medical settings produce
  small but statistically significant reductions in multiple drug/mixed substance
  use. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 116 randomized trials with over 64,000 participants
  found that drug-targeted brief interventions yield a small effect (Hedges' g = 0.08)
  on reducing illicit drug use. The effect is notably stronger when interventions
  are delivered by general practitioners (g = 0.19). However, the evidence for effects
  on single substances like cannabis alone was not significant after adjusting for
  multiple comparisons.
