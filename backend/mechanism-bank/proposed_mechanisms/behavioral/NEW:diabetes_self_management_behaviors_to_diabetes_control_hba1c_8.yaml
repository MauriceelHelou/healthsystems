direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Diabetes self-management behaviors encompass multiple practices including
  medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring, dietary management, physical activity,
  and foot care'
- 'Step 2: Consistent engagement in self-management behaviors leads to better regulation
  of blood glucose levels through direct physiological effects (diet, exercise, medication)
  and early detection of glycemic excursions (monitoring)'
- 'Step 3: Sustained self-management practices over time result in improved glycemic
  control as measured by lower HbA1c levels, reflecting average blood glucose over
  2-3 months'

description: Diabetes self-management behaviors positively influence glycemic control
  (HbA1c) through consistent engagement in medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring,
  dietary management, and physical activity. A systematic review of 15 RCTs demonstrated
  that improved self-management behaviors lead to reduced HbA1c levels. The relationship
  is moderated by diabetes duration, intervention setting, and delivery method, with
  longer disease duration and hospital-based settings showing stronger effects.
