category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in alcohol use disorder leads to repeated hepatotoxic
  exposure, causing direct hepatocyte injury and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 2: Sustained liver injury triggers inflammatory responses and activation of
  hepatic stellate cells, which produce excess extracellular matrix proteins including
  collagen'
- 'Step 3: Progressive accumulation of fibrous tissue in the liver leads to advancing
  fibrosis stages, which is the strongest predictor of mortality in alcohol-related
  liver disease'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to progressive liver fibrosis through chronic
  hepatotoxic injury. The systematic review establishes that liver fibrosis stage
  is the best predictor of mortality in alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD), with
  non-invasive tests demonstrating good prognostic performance (AUROC >0.7) for detecting
  fibrosis severity. This confirms the causal pathway from alcohol use disorder to
  liver fibrosis as a critical determinant of clinical outcomes.
