- 'Step 1: Children witness violence between parents during formative developmental
  years, observing intimate partner violence as a normative pattern of relationship
  behavior'
- 'Step 2: Through social learning and socialization processes, these observed behaviors
  become internalized as acceptable or expected dynamics within intimate relationships'
- 'Step 3: Childhood modeling of parental violence shapes future relationship expectations
  and responses, increasing vulnerability to experiencing or perpetrating sexual intimate
  partner violence in adult relationships'

description: Witnessing parental violence during childhood is a significant determinant
  of experiencing sexual intimate partner violence in adulthood. The study identifies
  this relationship as part of the socialization process, where childhood exposure
  to violence between parents models relationship dynamics and normalizes violence
  within intimate partnerships. This intergenerational transmission of violence operates
  through learned behavioral patterns and altered expectations about intimate relationships.
