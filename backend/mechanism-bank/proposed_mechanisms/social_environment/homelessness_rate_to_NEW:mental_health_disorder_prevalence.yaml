category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness exposes individuals to chronic stressors including lack of
  stable shelter, food insecurity, social isolation, and exposure to violence and
  victimization'
- 'Step 2: These stressors activate prolonged physiological stress responses and deplete
  psychological coping resources, increasing vulnerability to mental health conditions'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to healthcare services, social support networks, and stable
  environments prevents early intervention and treatment of emerging mental health
  symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to adverse conditions results in elevated prevalence
  of mental health disorders including substance use disorders (44%), major depression
  (19%), antisocial personality disorder (26%), schizophrenia (7%), and bipolar disorder
  (8%)'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis of 85 studies (N=48,414 participants)
  demonstrates that 67% of people experiencing homelessness currently have mental
  health disorders, with lifetime prevalence reaching 77%. This is substantially higher
  than general community samples. The relationship is bidirectional: mental health
  disorders may increase risk of homelessness, and experiencing homelessness increases
  risk of developing mental health disorders through exposure to chronic stressors
  and limited access to care.'
