direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Migrant women face structural barriers including language differences,
  unfamiliarity with healthcare systems, and potential documentation concerns that
  delay or limit access to prenatal and maternal healthcare services'
- 'Step 2: These barriers result in reduced utilization of preventive care, delayed
  recognition of warning signs, and suboptimal management of pregnancy complications'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare provider factors including implicit bias, communication challenges,
  and lack of culturally competent care may lead to delayed or inadequate treatment
  of emerging complications'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effects of pre-migration health exposures, stress of migration,
  and post-migration social determinants (housing instability, economic precarity)
  contribute to underlying health vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 5: The combination of reduced healthcare access, delayed treatment, and underlying
  vulnerabilities increases the risk of severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality'

description: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies found that migrant
  women in high-income countries, defined by birth outside the host country, have
  significantly elevated risks of severe maternal outcomes compared to native-born
  women. The pooled risk ratio for maternal mortality in Europe was 1.34 (95% CI:
  1.14-1.58). The magnitude of risk varied substantially by region of origin, with
  women from sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America/Caribbean showing the highest risks
  (RR 2.91 and 2.77 respectively). Similar patterns were observed for all-cause severe
  maternal morbidity and maternal ICU admission.'
