direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Migrant women face barriers to healthcare access including language barriers,
  unfamiliarity with healthcare systems, lack of health insurance coverage, and legal/documentation
  concerns'
- 'Step 2: These barriers result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care, reduced utilization
  of maternal health services, and missed opportunities for early identification of
  pregnancy complications'
- 'Step 3: Structural discrimination, cultural differences in care expectations, and
  potential implicit bias in healthcare settings may lead to suboptimal quality of
  care received'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated disadvantages result in higher rates of severe maternal complications
  and maternal mortality, particularly among migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Latin
  America/Caribbean, and Asia'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies found that migrant
  women in high-income countries, particularly in Europe, have significantly higher
  risk of maternal mortality compared to native-born women. The association is strongest
  among migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, and Asia. The mechanisms
  likely involve multiple intersecting barriers including healthcare access, language,
  cultural factors, and potential discrimination within healthcare systems.

    East/North Africa show no significant increased risk.

  description: Significant increased risk observed in European host countries, but
    not in USA or Australia, suggesting host country healthcare systems and immigration
    policies moderate the relationship.
