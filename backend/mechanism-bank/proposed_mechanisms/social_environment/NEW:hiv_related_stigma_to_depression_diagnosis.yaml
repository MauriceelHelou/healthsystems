- 'Step 1: People living with HIV experience HIV-related stigma (HRS) through social
  phenomena including structural inequalities, cultural discrimination, and discrimination
  by healthcare providers'
- 'Step 2: HRS causes negative psychological experiences including emotional distress,
  shame, and internalized stigma that compound the traumatic experience of HIV diagnosis'
- 'Step 3: These chronic psychological stressors lead to increased risk of depression,
  with those diagnosed with depression being 1.61 times more likely to report HRS,
  indicating a bidirectional reinforcing relationship'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies (n=9548) demonstrates
  that HIV-related stigma has a detrimental association with depression among people
  living with HIV. The relationship is bidirectional, with stigma contributing to
  depression through emotional distress and shame, while depression may also increase
  vulnerability to experiencing or reporting stigma. Social support serves as a protective
  factor against both stigma and its mental health consequences.
