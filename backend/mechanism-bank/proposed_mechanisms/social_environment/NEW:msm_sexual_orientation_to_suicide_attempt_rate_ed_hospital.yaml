direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MSM identity exposes individuals to minority stress including discrimination,
  stigma, social rejection, and internalized homophobia'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure to minority stressors leads to elevated rates of mental
  health disorders including depression, anxiety, and substance use'
- 'Step 3: Mental health burden combined with social isolation, lack of family support,
  and experiences of victimization increases suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Suicidal ideation, particularly when combined with HIV-related stressors
  and other intersecting vulnerabilities, progresses to suicide attempts at rates
  significantly higher than general male population'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 studies found that MSM
  have a 12% global prevalence of suicide attempts, which is substantially higher
  than rates in the general male population. The elevated risk is attributed to minority
  stress, discrimination, stigma, and associated mental health burden. MSM with HIV
  face compounded vulnerability with 40% prevalence of suicidal ideation.
