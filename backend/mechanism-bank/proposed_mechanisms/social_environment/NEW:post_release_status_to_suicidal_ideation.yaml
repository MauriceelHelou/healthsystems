direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Release from incarceration creates an acute transition period characterized
  by disruption of social supports, housing instability, and loss of structured environment'
- 'Step 2: Post-release individuals face significant challenges including stigma,
  barriers to employment, severed family relationships, and difficulty accessing mental
  health services'
- 'Step 3: These cumulative stressors, combined with pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities
  common in incarcerated populations, significantly elevate risk for suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: The immediate post-release period represents a particularly high-risk window,
  as evidenced by suicide rates exceeding those during incarceration itself'

description: People released from incarceration are at substantially elevated risk
  for suicide and suicidal ideation compared to the general population, with standardized
  mortality ratios over 7 times higher. This systematic review and meta-analysis of
  29 studies found suicide rates are higher after release than during incarceration,
  indicating the post-release transition represents a critical high-risk period. The
  elevation in risk is particularly pronounced for women, who show approximately three
  times the relative risk increase compared to men, though no studies specifically
  reporting suicidal ideation stratified results by sex.
