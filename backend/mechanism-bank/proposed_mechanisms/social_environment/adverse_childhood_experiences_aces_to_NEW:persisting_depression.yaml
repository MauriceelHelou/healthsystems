mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood trauma (ACEs) creates lasting neurobiological, psychological,
  and interpersonal vulnerabilities that persist into adulthood'
- 'Step 2: These vulnerabilities include altered stress response systems, negative
  cognitive schemas, attachment difficulties, and impaired emotion regulation'
- 'Step 3: When depression develops, these trauma-related vulnerabilities contribute
  to treatment resistance and symptom persistence, making recovery more difficult'
- 'Step 4: The combination of unresolved trauma effects and depressive symptoms creates
  a cycle that is harder to break with standard psychological interventions'

description: Childhood trauma (ACEs) is identified as a frequently studied predictor
  variable for treatment response in persisting forms of depression (chronic, recurrent,
  and treatment-resistant). While the systematic review notes that childhood trauma
  was among the most frequently examined predictors across the 23 included studies,
  the evidence for its predictive value was not as consistently replicated as baseline
  depression severity. The relationship between ACEs and persisting depression likely
  operates through multiple pathways including neurobiological alterations, psychological
  vulnerabilities, and interpersonal difficulties that make depression more resistant
  to standard treatments.
