mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Release from incarceration creates acute transitional stress including
  loss of structured environment, social support disruption, and reentry challenges'
- 'Step 2: Post-release individuals face compounding vulnerabilities including housing
  instability, unemployment, stigma, disrupted healthcare access, and substance use
  relapse risks'
- 'Step 3: Pre-existing mental health conditions prevalent in incarcerated populations
  interact with post-release stressors, increasing psychological distress'
- 'Step 4: The combination of accumulated trauma, social marginalization, and inadequate
  community mental health support leads to elevated rates of self-harm and suicidal
  behavior compared to general population'

description: People released from incarceration have substantially elevated risk of
  suicide and self-harm compared to the general population, with a pooled standardized
  mortality ratio of 7.4. The suicide crude mortality rate is 114.5 per 100,000 person
  years for released individuals. Notably, the rate of suicide is higher after release
  than during incarceration, indicating the post-release period represents a particularly
  vulnerable time. Women experience a disproportionately elevated risk relative to
  their general population counterparts.
