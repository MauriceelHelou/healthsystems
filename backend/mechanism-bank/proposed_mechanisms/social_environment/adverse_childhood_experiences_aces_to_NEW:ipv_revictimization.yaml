direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood abuse disrupts healthy attachment formation and emotional regulation
  development, creating vulnerability to unhealthy relationship patterns'
- 'Step 2: Early trauma exposure normalizes violence in intimate relationships and
  may impair ability to recognize warning signs of abusive partners'
- 'Step 3: Trauma-related coping mechanisms (including substance use) and PTSD symptomatology
  further increase vulnerability to subsequent victimization'
- 'Step 4: These compounding factors result in elevated risk of experiencing repeated
  intimate partner violence across multiple relationships'

description: Childhood abuse is the most strongly associated risk factor for intimate
  partner violence revictimization. This meta-analysis of 22 studies found that early
  adverse experiences create vulnerability through disrupted attachment, normalized
  violence, and trauma-related coping patterns that increase likelihood of experiencing
  repeated intimate partner violence across the lifespan.
