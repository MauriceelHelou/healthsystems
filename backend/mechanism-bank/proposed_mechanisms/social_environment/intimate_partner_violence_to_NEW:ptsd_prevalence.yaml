mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women experience intimate partner violence (physical, psychological, or
  sexual) which constitutes direct exposure to traumatic events involving threat to
  physical safety and bodily autonomy'
- 'Step 2: IPV exposure triggers trauma responses including hyperarousal, intrusive
  memories, emotional dysregulation, and avoidance behaviors characteristic of PTSD
  symptomatology'
- 'Step 3: Repeated or chronic IPV exposure reinforces trauma pathways, with ongoing
  threat perception, learned helplessness, and disrupted sense of safety contributing
  to persistent PTSD development'
- 'Step 4: The relational nature of IPV complicates recovery as the source of trauma
  is often within the home environment, creating complex trauma responses and elevated
  PTSD risk'

description: Intimate partner violence significantly increases the odds of posttraumatic
  stress disorder among women. A comprehensive meta-analysis of 201 studies with over
  250,000 women found that IPV exposure was associated with OR = 2.15-2.66 for PTSD
  outcomes. This relationship was consistent across different types of IPV (physical,
  psychological, sexual) and across clinical and community populations, though prevalence
  rates varied by country income level.
