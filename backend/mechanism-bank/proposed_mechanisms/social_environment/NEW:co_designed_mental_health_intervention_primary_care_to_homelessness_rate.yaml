- 'Step 1: Co-designed mental health interventions engage people experiencing homelessness
  (PEH) in the design process, creating services that are more acceptable, accessible,
  and tailored to their specific needs and barriers'
- 'Step 2: These interventions increase primary care utilization among PEH while reducing
  reliance on emergency departments and hospital admissions, providing more consistent
  and cost-effective mental healthcare'
- 'Step 3: Improved mental health outcomes enable individuals to better engage with
  housing services, maintain stable relationships, and address barriers to obtaining
  and maintaining housing'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced mental health stability and quality of life directly contribute
  to improved housing situations, reducing homelessness rates among program participants'

description: Co-designed mental health interventions in primary care settings, developed
  with meaningful participation from people experiencing homelessness, demonstrate
  positive impacts on both mental health outcomes and housing situations. By creating
  more accessible and acceptable services, these interventions increase engagement
  with primary care, improve mental health and quality of life, and ultimately support
  pathways out of homelessness.
