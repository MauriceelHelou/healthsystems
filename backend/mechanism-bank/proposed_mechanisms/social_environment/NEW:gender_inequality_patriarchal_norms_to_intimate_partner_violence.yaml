direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patriarchal norms establish male dominance and control over women as socially
  acceptable, creating power imbalances within intimate relationships'
- 'Step 2: Gender inequality manifests in structural barriers (economic dependence,
  limited legal protections, reduced autonomy) that increase women''s vulnerability
  and reduce their ability to leave abusive situations'
- 'Step 3: These norms normalize violence as a means of maintaining male authority
  and disciplining women who transgress expected gender roles'
- 'Step 4: Patriarchal contexts cluster with other structural risk factors (post-colonial
  legacies, economic inequality) creating compounding high-risk environments for IPV'

description: Latent class analysis of 190 countries identified three distinct risk
  contexts for IPV based on structural and contextual drivers. Non-patriarchal egalitarian
  contexts showed the lowest IPV prevalence, while patriarchal post-colonial contexts
  (with or without conflict/disaster exposure) showed the highest. Gender norms emerged
  as a key distinguishing factor between low and high-risk contexts, supporting the
  theoretical importance of patriarchal structures in driving IPV at the population
  level.
