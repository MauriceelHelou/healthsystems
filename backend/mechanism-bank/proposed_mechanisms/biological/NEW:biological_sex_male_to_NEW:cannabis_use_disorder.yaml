direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Males demonstrate higher rates of cannabis initiation and use compared
  to females, potentially due to biological differences in endocannabinoid system
  function and hormonal influences'
- 'Step 2: Greater exposure to cannabis combined with possible sex-specific neurobiological
  responses increases vulnerability to developing problematic use patterns'
- 'Step 3: Males are approximately twice as likely to receive a clinical diagnosis
  of cannabis use disorder, though this may also reflect differential help-seeking
  behaviors and diagnostic patterns'

description: Males are approximately twice as likely as females to be diagnosed with
  cannabis use disorder (OR = 2.0, CI = 1.9-2.1). This sex difference is observed
  across multiple study types and populations, though the magnitude varies by comorbid
  mental illness status. While males show higher overall diagnosis rates, females
  may be more susceptible to developing and maintaining CUD once initiated, and mental
  illness appears to differentially increase CUD risk by sex.
