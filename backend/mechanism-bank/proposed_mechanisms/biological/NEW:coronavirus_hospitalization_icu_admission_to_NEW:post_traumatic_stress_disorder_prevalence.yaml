direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe coronavirus infection (SARS/MERS) requiring hospitalization or ICU
  admission exposes patients to life-threatening illness and acute respiratory distress'
- 'Step 2: ICU admission involves traumatic medical experiences including invasive
  procedures, mechanical ventilation, isolation, and fear of death'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged hospitalization creates sustained psychological stress from uncertainty,
  physical suffering, and social isolation'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological stress responses during critical illness may dysregulate
  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and alter fear processing circuits'
- 'Step 5: Post-discharge, survivors experience persistent intrusive memories, hypervigilance,
  and avoidance behaviors characteristic of PTSD, with prevalence of 39% beyond 6
  months'

description: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies demonstrates that
  survivors of severe SARS and MERS coronavirus infections requiring hospitalization
  or ICU admission have a pooled PTSD prevalence of 39% (95% CI: 31-47%) at follow-up
  beyond 6 months. This high prevalence reflects the traumatic nature of severe respiratory
  illness, life-threatening experiences during hospitalization, and prolonged recovery
  periods. The evidence suggests clinicians should anticipate similar long-term psychological
  outcomes in COVID-19 survivors.'
