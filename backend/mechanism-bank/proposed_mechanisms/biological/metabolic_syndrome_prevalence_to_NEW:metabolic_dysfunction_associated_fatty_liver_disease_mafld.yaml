direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Metabolic syndrome components (obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia,
  hypertension) create systemic metabolic dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Insulin resistance promotes de novo lipogenesis in hepatocytes and reduces
  fatty acid oxidation, leading to hepatic fat accumulation'
- 'Step 3: Adipose tissue dysfunction releases excess free fatty acids and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines that traffic to the liver'
- 'Step 4: Hepatic steatosis develops when lipid accumulation exceeds the liver''s
  metabolic capacity, meeting MAFLD diagnostic criteria (steatosis plus metabolic
  dysfunction markers)'
- 'Step 5: MAFLD by definition requires metabolic dysfunction (overweight/obesity,
  type 2 diabetes, or metabolic dysregulation), directly linking metabolic syndrome
  components to disease diagnosis'

description: Metabolic syndrome prevalence directly contributes to MAFLD through shared
  pathophysiological mechanisms. MAFLD diagnostic criteria explicitly require metabolic
  dysfunction markers (overweight/obesity with ethnicity-specific BMI thresholds,
  type 2 diabetes, or evidence of metabolic dysregulation) in addition to hepatic
  steatosis. This meta-analysis found that 48.7% of hepatocellular carcinoma patients
  had MAFLD, with metabolic dysfunction serving as both a defining criterion and causal
  pathway. The high prevalence of MAFLD as a co-factor in other liver diseases (40-64%)
  demonstrates how metabolic syndrome amplifies liver disease progression across multiple
  etiologies.
