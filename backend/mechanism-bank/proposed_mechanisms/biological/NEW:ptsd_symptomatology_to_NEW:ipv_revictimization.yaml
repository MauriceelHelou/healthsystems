direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PTSD symptomatology involves neurobiological changes including hyperactivation
  of the amygdala and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,
  leading to altered threat detection and stress response systems'
- 'Step 2: These biological changes manifest as hypervigilance alternating with emotional
  numbing, dissociation, and impaired risk assessment, compromising the ability to
  accurately perceive and respond to danger cues in intimate relationships'
- 'Step 3: PTSD-related avoidance symptoms and emotional dysregulation may impair
  decision-making capacity regarding partner selection and relationship safety evaluation'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative effect of these neurobiological and psychological impairments
  increases vulnerability to entering or remaining in abusive relationships, elevating
  risk of intimate partner violence revictimization'

description: PTSD symptomatology is a significant risk factor for intimate partner
  violence revictimization. The biological pathway involves neurobiological alterations
  in stress response systems, threat detection, and emotional regulation that impair
  protective decision-making and risk assessment in intimate relationships. This meta-analysis
  of 22 studies identified PTSD symptomatology among the significant risk factors
  for IPV revictimization in women.
