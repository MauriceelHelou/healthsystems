direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ketamine (typically 0.5 mg/kg) administered via intravenous infusion over
  30-45 minutes acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist'
- 'Step 2: NMDA receptor blockade triggers rapid glutamatergic signaling changes and
  increases BDNF release, promoting rapid synaptic plasticity'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes produce rapid antidepressant effects and
  significant reduction in suicidal ideation within 4 hours post-infusion'
- 'Step 4: Anti-suicidal effects persist up to 72 hours post-infusion but do not appear
  to extend beyond this timeframe with single-dose administration'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials
  (N=572) demonstrates that a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over
  30-45 minutes) produces rapid and significant reductions in suicidal ideation in
  adults with psychiatric disorders, predominantly affective disorders. The anti-suicidal
  effect emerges within 4 hours post-infusion (SMD=-0.51) and persists up to 72 hours
  (SMD=-0.57 at 24-72 hours), but does not extend beyond this timeframe. Evidence
  was rated moderate to low quality, with marked heterogeneity across studies. Intranasal
  esketamine showed only marginal effects in the single available trial. Virtually
  no data exists on effects on actual suicidal behavior.
