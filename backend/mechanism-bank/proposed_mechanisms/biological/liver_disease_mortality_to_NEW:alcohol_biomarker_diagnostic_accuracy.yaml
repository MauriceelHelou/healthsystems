direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advanced liver disease causes hepatic damage that impairs normal metabolic
  enzyme function, reducing the liver''s capacity to form alcohol biomarkers such
  as carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT)'
- 'Step 2: Liver disease often leads to kidney dysfunction and necessitates diuretic
  use, which alters the excretion patterns of urinary biomarkers (ethyl glucuronide,
  ethyl sulfate)'
- 'Step 3: Systemic effects of severe liver disease may alter deposition of alcohol
  metabolites in hair and nails, affecting long-term biomarker detection'
- 'Step 4: These pathophysiological changes reduce sensitivity and specificity of
  standard alcohol biomarkers, compromising diagnostic accuracy in patients with liver
  disease compared to healthy populations'

description: 'Liver disease impairs the diagnostic accuracy of alcohol biomarkers
  through multiple biological mechanisms: hepatic damage reduces biomarker formation
  (particularly CDT), kidney dysfunction and diuretics alter excretion of urinary
  biomarkers, and systemic effects may alter deposition in hair/nails. This systematic
  review of 12 studies found that while some biomarkers (urinary and hair ethyl glucuronide,
  phosphatidylethanol) maintain reasonable accuracy, others (serum CDT) show substantially
  reduced sensitivity in liver disease patients.'
