direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes adaptive neurological changes, including
  downregulation of inhibitory GABA receptors and upregulation of excitatory glutamate
  (NMDA) receptors'
- 'Step 2: Upon cessation of alcohol, the compensatory neuroadaptations result in
  an imbalance with reduced inhibitory neurotransmission (GABA) and increased excitatory
  neurotransmission (glutamate)'
- 'Step 3: This neurotransmitter imbalance produces a state of CNS hyperexcitability
  characterized by autonomic instability, agitation, and altered consciousness'
- 'Step 4: The severity of the inhibitory/excitatory imbalance directly correlates
  with the severity of alcohol withdrawal delirium, as measured by clinical assessment
  scales (CIWA, RASS)'
- 'Step 5: Standard benzodiazepine therapy targeting GABA receptors alone is often
  inadequate to control delirium symptoms due to the magnitude of neurotransmitter
  imbalance in severe cases'

description: The imbalance between inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) neurotransmitters
  that develops during chronic alcohol use and manifests upon alcohol cessation directly
  drives the severity of alcohol withdrawal delirium. This systematic review of 4
  studies demonstrates that benzodiazepine-based therapy alone is often inadequate
  to control delirium symptoms in ICU patients due to this fundamental neurotransmitter
  imbalance, supporting the causal relationship between neurotransmitter dysregulation
  and delirium severity.
