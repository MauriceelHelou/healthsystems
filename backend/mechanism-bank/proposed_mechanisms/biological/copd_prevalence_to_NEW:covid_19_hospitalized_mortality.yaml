direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COPD causes pre-existing structural lung damage including airway remodeling,
  emphysematous changes, and impaired mucociliary clearance, reducing baseline respiratory
  reserve'
- 'Step 2: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes additional pulmonary damage through viral pneumonia
  and inflammatory response, overwhelming already compromised respiratory function'
- 'Step 3: COPD patients have chronic systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation,
  which may amplify the cytokine storm response characteristic of severe COVID-19'
- 'Step 4: Reduced respiratory capacity combined with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory
  distress syndrome leads to rapid respiratory failure and increased mortality risk'

description: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is identified as a significant
  predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ranking second after diabetes
  mellitus in adjusted analyses. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 87 studies
  with 35,486 patients demonstrates that pre-existing COPD increases vulnerability
  to COVID-19 mortality through compromised baseline pulmonary function and impaired
  respiratory reserve. The relationship is modified by age and sex, with effects varying
  across geographic regions.
