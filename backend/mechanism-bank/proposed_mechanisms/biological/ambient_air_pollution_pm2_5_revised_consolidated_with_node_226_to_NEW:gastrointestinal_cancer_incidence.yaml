direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PM2.5 particles are inhaled and enter systemic circulation, with some particles
  also being swallowed and directly entering the gastrointestinal tract'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 and its chemical components induce oxidative stress and chronic inflammation
  in GI tissues through direct contact and systemic inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 3: Sustained inflammation and oxidative damage lead to DNA damage, mutations,
  and epigenetic alterations in gastrointestinal epithelial cells'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic and epigenetic changes promote cellular proliferation,
  inhibit apoptosis, and facilitate carcinogenesis in the liver, colorectum, and other
  GI organs'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 epidemiologic studies from
  14 countries demonstrates that PM2.5 exposure is associated with increased risk
  of gastrointestinal cancer incidence. The meta-analysis of 13 studies found an overall
  12% increased risk (RR=1.12), with stronger associations for liver cancer (31% increase)
  and colorectal cancer (35% increase). All studies identified positive associations,
  though not all reached statistical significance. The evidence was rated as 'moderate'
  quality with 'limited' strength, primarily due to inconsistent statistical significance
  and small number of studies per cancer site.
