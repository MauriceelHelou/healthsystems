direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Decompensated cirrhosis leads to progressive hepatocyte dysfunction and
  necrosis, causing release of intracellular ferritin stores into circulation'
- 'Step 2: Impaired liver function reduces hepcidin production, dysregulating iron
  homeostasis and increasing iron absorption and ferritin synthesis'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation associated with decompensated cirrhosis (including
  bacterial translocation and immune activation) stimulates ferritin as an acute phase
  reactant'
- 'Step 4: Reduced hepatic clearance capacity in cirrhosis contributes to elevated
  circulating ferritin levels'

description: Decompensated cirrhosis is associated with a 40.6% prevalence of elevated
  serum ferritin. This elevation occurs through multiple mechanisms including hepatocyte
  damage releasing stored ferritin, dysregulated iron metabolism due to impaired hepcidin
  production, systemic inflammation triggering ferritin as an acute phase protein,
  and reduced hepatic clearance. The association is stronger in males, those with
  alcoholic etiology, more severe liver disease (Child-Pugh C), and those with hepatic
  encephalopathy.
