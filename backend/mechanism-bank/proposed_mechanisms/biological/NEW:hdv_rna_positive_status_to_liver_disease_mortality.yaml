direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Active HDV replication indicated by detectable HDV RNA in patients co-infected
  with HBV leads to persistent viral hepatitis'
- 'Step 2: HDV superinfection or co-infection accelerates hepatic inflammation and
  fibrogenesis beyond HBV monoinfection alone'
- 'Step 3: Progressive liver damage leads to compensated cirrhosis at higher rates
  in HDV RNA+ patients'
- 'Step 4: Continued viral activity and liver dysfunction progress to decompensated
  cirrhosis with portal hypertension and synthetic failure'
- 'Step 5: Advanced cirrhosis increases risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development'
- 'Step 6: End-stage liver disease manifestations (decompensation, HCC, liver failure)
  result in significantly elevated liver-related mortality'

description: 'HDV RNA positive status indicates active hepatitis delta virus replication
  in patients co-infected with hepatitis B. This active viral replication accelerates
  liver disease progression compared to HDV RNA negative patients, leading to significantly
  higher rates of advanced liver disease events including cirrhosis, decompensation,
  hepatocellular carcinoma, and ultimately liver-related mortality (HR 3.78, 95% CI:
  2.18-6.56).'
