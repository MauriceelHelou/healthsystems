direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lichen sclerosus initiates chronic inflammatory processes in genital tissue,
  characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and cytokine-mediated tissue damage'
- 'Step 2: Persistent inflammation leads to progressive fibrosis, collagen deposition,
  and loss of elastic fibers in the dermal layer'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing fibrotic changes result in structural alterations including tissue
  adhesions, scarring, and loss of normal anatomical architecture (labial fusion,
  clitoral phimosis in women; phimosis, meatal stenosis in men)'

description: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that leads to genital
  architectural changes through progressive fibrotic tissue remodeling. A systematic
  review of 900 studies documented that loss of normal architecture is a major clinical
  presentation, occurring in 14% of female cases and 34% of male cases. The inflammatory
  process causes tissue scarring, adhesions, and structural deformities that alter
  normal genital anatomy.
