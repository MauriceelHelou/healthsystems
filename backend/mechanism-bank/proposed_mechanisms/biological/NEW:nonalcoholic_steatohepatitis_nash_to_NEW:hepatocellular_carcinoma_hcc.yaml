direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NASH causes chronic liver inflammation with hepatocyte injury, leading
  to cycles of cell death and regeneration'
- 'Step 2: Repeated hepatocyte turnover and oxidative stress promote accumulation
  of genetic mutations in liver progenitor cells'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis develops in most cases, creating a pro-tumorigenic
  microenvironment, though HCC can arise even without significant fibrosis in up to
  38% of NASH-HCC cases'
- 'Step 4: Metabolic dysfunction associated with NASH (insulin resistance, lipotoxicity,
  altered adipokine signaling) provides additional carcinogenic stimulus independent
  of cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: Malignant transformation of HCC precursor cells leads to hepatocellular
  carcinoma initiation and progression'

description: NASH promotes hepatocellular carcinoma through chronic inflammation,
  repeated hepatocyte injury and regeneration cycles, and progressive fibrosis. Unlike
  other chronic liver diseases where cirrhosis almost always precedes HCC, NASH can
  lead to HCC even without significant fibrosis in a substantial proportion of cases
  (up to 38%), suggesting additional obesity-related metabolic mechanisms contribute
  to carcinogenesis.
