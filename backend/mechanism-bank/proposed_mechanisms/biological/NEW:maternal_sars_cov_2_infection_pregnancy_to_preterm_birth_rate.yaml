direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers systemic inflammatory response with
  elevated cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) and acute phase reactants'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory mediators can compromise placental function and trigger premature
  cervical ripening and uterine contractions'
- 'Step 3: Severe maternal illness may necessitate iatrogenic preterm delivery for
  maternal or fetal indications'
- 'Step 4: Potential direct viral effects on placental tissue and fetal membranes
  may contribute to spontaneous preterm labor'
- 'Step 5: Increased rates of preterm birth observed in infants born following maternal
  SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy'

description: Systematic review of 204 studies encompassing 45,646 infants found that
  preterm birth was more common in infants born following maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection
  during pregnancy, particularly in larger studies. The association is mediated through
  maternal inflammatory responses, potential placental dysfunction, and clinical decisions
  for early delivery in severe cases.
