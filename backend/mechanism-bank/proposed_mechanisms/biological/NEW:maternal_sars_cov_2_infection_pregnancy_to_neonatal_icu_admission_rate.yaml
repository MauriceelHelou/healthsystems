direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy triggers systemic inflammatory
  response and potential placental dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Infection increases risk of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction
  (small for gestational age), both independent risk factors for NICU admission'
- 'Step 3: Neonates born to infected mothers may experience respiratory complications
  and require higher levels of respiratory support'
- 'Step 4: Precautionary clinical protocols for COVID-exposed neonates may also contribute
  to increased NICU admission rates for monitoring and isolation purposes'
- 'Step 5: Combined direct effects (prematurity, respiratory disease) and indirect
  effects (clinical protocols) result in higher NICU admission rates'

description: Systematic review of 204 studies including 45,646 neonates across 36
  countries found that neonatal unit admission was more common in infants born following
  maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, particularly in larger studies.
  The association appears driven by both direct biological effects (increased preterm
  birth, respiratory complications) and indirect consequences (clinical protocols
  requiring monitoring of exposed neonates). Limited evidence of increased risk of
  specific neonatal morbidities including respiratory disease was found.
