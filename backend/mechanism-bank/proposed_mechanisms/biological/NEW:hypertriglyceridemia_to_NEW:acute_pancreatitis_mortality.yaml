direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hypertriglyceridemia leads to accumulation of triglycerides in pancreatic
  capillaries, where pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes them into free fatty acids'
- 'Step 2: High concentrations of free fatty acids cause direct toxic injury to pancreatic
  acinar cells and capillary endothelium, triggering inflammation and microcirculatory
  disturbances'
- 'Step 3: HTG-induced acute pancreatitis develops with higher severity, characterized
  by increased rates of organ failure, intensive care unit admission, and pancreatic
  necrosis compared to other etiologies'
- 'Step 4: The more severe disease course with multiple complications results in significantly
  elevated mortality rates compared to alcoholic or biliary acute pancreatitis'

description: Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) is associated
  with significantly higher mortality compared to other common etiologies of acute
  pancreatitis. This meta-analysis of 127 studies found that HTG-AP patients have
  72% higher odds of mortality compared to alcoholic AP and 50% higher odds compared
  to biliary AP. HTG-AP is also associated with the highest risk for developing non-mild
  disease and the highest number of complications overall.
