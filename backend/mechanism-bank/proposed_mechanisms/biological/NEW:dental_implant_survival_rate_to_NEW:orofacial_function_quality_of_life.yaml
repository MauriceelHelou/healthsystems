category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dental implants are placed in bone (either native or reconstructed free
  bone flaps) to provide stable anchoring points for prosthetic teeth'
- 'Step 2: Higher implant survival rates ensure long-term stability and retention
  of dental prostheses, maintaining structural integrity of the oral rehabilitation'
- 'Step 3: Stable prosthetic rehabilitation restores masticatory function, enabling
  proper chewing and food processing'
- 'Step 4: Improved mastication and oral function leads to better nutritional intake
  and dietary variety'
- 'Step 5: Aesthetic restoration of the dental arch improves facial appearance and
  self-confidence'
- 'Step 6: Combined functional and aesthetic improvements translate to enhanced overall
  orofacial function and quality of life'

description: Dental implant survival rate positively influences orofacial function
  and quality of life through prosthetic rehabilitation. Successful implant osseointegration
  and long-term survival enable stable dental prostheses that restore masticatory
  function, speech, and facial aesthetics. In oncological patients undergoing free
  bone flap reconstruction, higher implant survival rates (92.5% for primary implantation)
  facilitate rapid functional and aesthetic improvement, directly enhancing quality
  of life outcomes.
