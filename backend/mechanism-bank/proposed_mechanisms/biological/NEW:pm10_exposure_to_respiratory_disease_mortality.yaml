direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term inhalation of PM10 particles deposits coarse and fine particulate
  matter in the respiratory tract, with larger particles (2.5-10μm) primarily affecting
  upper airways and bronchi'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure triggers sustained inflammatory responses in lung tissue,
  including oxidative stress, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and recruitment
  of inflammatory cells'
- 'Step 3: Persistent inflammation leads to progressive airway remodeling, fibrosis,
  impaired mucociliary clearance, and compromised lung function over time'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative damage exacerbates chronic respiratory conditions (COPD, asthma,
  interstitial lung disease), increases susceptibility to respiratory infections,
  and ultimately increases risk of respiratory mortality'

description: Long-term exposure to PM10 is positively and significantly associated
  with increased respiratory disease mortality. This WHO-commissioned systematic review
  and meta-analysis of 106 studies provides high certainty evidence that chronic PM10
  inhalation leads to cumulative respiratory damage through sustained inflammation,
  oxidative stress, and progressive deterioration of lung function, ultimately increasing
  mortality risk from respiratory causes.
