direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oxidative stress in the liver is induced by various agents including alcohol,
  drugs, viral infections, environmental pollutants, and dietary components, leading
  to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)'
- 'Step 2: ROS accumulation causes lipid peroxidation, proinflammatory cytokine release,
  and activation of hepatic stellate cells, which initiates and propagates liver injury'
- 'Step 3: Chronic oxidative damage overwhelms antioxidant defense systems (SOD, CAT,
  GSH, GPx, GR) and impairs Nrf2 protective responses'
- 'Step 4: Sustained oxidative injury drives progression from initial liver damage
  to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
  fibrosis, and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: Advanced liver disease (cirrhosis) leads to liver failure, hepatocellular
  carcinoma risk, and increased liver disease mortality'

description: Hepatic oxidative stress is a key causative factor in liver damage progression.
  ROS accumulation from various sources (alcohol, drugs, viruses, pollutants, dietary
  factors) leads to lipid peroxidation, proinflammatory cytokine activation, and hepatic
  stellate cell activation. This overwhelms cellular antioxidant defenses (Nrf2, SOD,
  CAT, GSH, GPx, GR) and drives progression through stages of liver injury including
  NASH, NAFLD, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, ultimately increasing liver disease mortality.
