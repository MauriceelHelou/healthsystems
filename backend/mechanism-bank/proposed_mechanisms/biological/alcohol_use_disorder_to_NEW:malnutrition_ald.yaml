direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to inadequate dietary intake due to alcohol
  replacing nutrient-dense foods and appetite suppression'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol damages the gastrointestinal mucosa and impairs nutrient absorption
  and digestion, particularly affecting vitamins and trace elements'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol disrupts normal lipid metabolism and increases skeletal and visceral
  protein catabolism, leading to muscle wasting'
- 'Step 4: Progressive liver damage from alcohol impairs the liver''s metabolic and
  synthetic functions, exacerbating nutritional deficiencies'
- 'Step 5: As ALD progresses to cirrhosis, protein-energy malnutrition and sarcopenia
  develop, worsening patient prognosis'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to malnutrition in alcoholic liver disease
  through a complex, multifactorial etiology. The mechanisms include inadequate dietary
  intake due to alcohol substituting for nutritious foods, impaired gastrointestinal
  absorption and digestion caused by mucosal damage, increased protein catabolism
  in skeletal and visceral tissues, and abnormal interactions between ethanol and
  lipid metabolism. These factors combine to cause deficiencies in macronutrients,
  vitamins, and trace elements. As liver disease progresses, malnutrition worsens
  and is associated with poorer prognosis, complications such as ascites and hepatic
  encephalopathy, and development of sarcopenia.
