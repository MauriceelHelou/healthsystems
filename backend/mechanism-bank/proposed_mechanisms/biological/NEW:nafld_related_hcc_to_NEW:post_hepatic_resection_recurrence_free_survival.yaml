direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NAFLD-related HCC patients have lower rates of underlying cirrhosis (50.4%
  vs 64.0%) compared to HCC of other aetiologies, preserving more functional liver
  parenchyma'
- 'Step 2: Better preserved liver function allows for more complete surgical resection
  with adequate functional liver remnant, reducing residual disease burden'
- 'Step 3: The absence of severe cirrhosis-related portal hypertension and hepatic
  dysfunction reduces the microenvironment favorable for tumor recurrence'
- 'Step 4: Lower cirrhosis rates may enable better post-operative liver regeneration
  and immune surveillance against residual cancer cells, contributing to improved
  recurrence-free survival'

description: Meta-analysis of 17 retrospective studies involving 11,477 patients found
  that NAFLD-related HCC is associated with slightly improved recurrence-free survival
  after hepatic resection compared to HCC of other aetiologies (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84-1.02).
  This trend reached statistical significance in Asian subpopulations (HR 0.88, 95%
  CI 0.79-0.98). The mechanism may relate to lower cirrhosis prevalence in NAFLD-HCC
  patients, allowing better liver function reserve and surgical outcomes.
