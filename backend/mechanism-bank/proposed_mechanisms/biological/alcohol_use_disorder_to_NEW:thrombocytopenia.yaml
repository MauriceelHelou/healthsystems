  node_name: Thrombocytopenia (Low Platelet Count)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption associated with alcohol use disorder leads
  to direct toxic effects on bone marrow, suppressing megakaryocyte production and
  platelet formation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced liver damage (common in AUD) impairs thrombopoietin production,
  which is essential for platelet synthesis'
- 'Step 3: Splenic sequestration of platelets occurs due to portal hypertension and
  splenomegaly associated with alcohol-related liver disease'
- 'Step 4: Direct toxic effects of alcohol on circulating platelets reduce their lifespan
  and functional capacity'
- 'Step 5: Resulting thrombocytopenia is prevalent in 46% of patients hospitalized
  for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, with lower platelet counts associated with more
  severe clinical presentations'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to thrombocytopenia through multiple biological
  mechanisms including direct bone marrow suppression, impaired hepatic thrombopoietin
  production, and increased splenic sequestration. In a study of 300 hospitalized
  patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, 46% exhibited thrombocytopenia, with
  significantly higher prevalence (71%) in those experiencing complicated withdrawal
  (delirium tremens or seizures) compared to non-complicated cases (21%).
