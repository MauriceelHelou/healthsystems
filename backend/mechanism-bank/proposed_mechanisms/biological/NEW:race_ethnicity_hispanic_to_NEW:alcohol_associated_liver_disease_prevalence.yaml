category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hispanic individuals in the United States demonstrate higher rates of alcohol-associated
  liver disease compared to White and Black populations'
- 'Step 2: Biological factors may include genetic polymorphisms affecting alcohol
  metabolism (e.g., ADH and ALDH variants) that differ across ethnic populations,
  potentially affecting susceptibility to alcohol-induced liver injury'
- 'Step 3: Social determinants including access to healthcare, socioeconomic factors,
  and cultural patterns of alcohol consumption may interact with biological susceptibility'
- 'Step 4: These combined factors result in Hispanic individuals having 64% higher
  prevalence of alcohol-associated liver disease compared to White individuals'

description: Hispanic individuals in the United States have a 64% higher prevalence
  of alcohol-associated liver disease compared to White individuals, with an absolute
  prevalence of 4.5% compared to 3.1% in White and 1.4% in Black populations. This
  systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 studies comprising over 76 million patients
  demonstrates significant racial/ethnic disparities in ALD epidemiology, though the
  underlying mechanisms remain incompletely characterized.
