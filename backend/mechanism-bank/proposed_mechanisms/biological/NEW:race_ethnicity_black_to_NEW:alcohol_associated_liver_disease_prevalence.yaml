direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black individuals in the United States demonstrate lower prevalence rates
  of alcohol-associated liver disease (1.4%) compared to White (3.1%) and Hispanic
  (4.5%) populations'
- 'Step 2: Potential biological factors may include differences in alcohol metabolism
  enzyme variants (ADH and ALDH polymorphisms) that vary by ancestry, though specific
  mechanisms remain poorly characterized in the literature'
- 'Step 3: Despite lower ALD prevalence, mortality among those with ALD does not significantly
  differ between Black and White individuals (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.8–1.6), suggesting
  the protective effect operates primarily at the disease development stage rather
  than progression'
- 'Step 4: The exact biological mechanisms underlying this racial disparity remain
  incompletely understood and may involve complex interactions between genetic susceptibility,
  drinking patterns, and other unmeasured factors'

description: 'Black individuals in the United States have significantly lower prevalence
  of alcohol-associated liver disease compared to White individuals (pooled risk ratio
  0.59, 95% CI: 0.35–0.87). This meta-analysis of 16 studies comprising over 76 million
  patients found ALD prevalence of 1.4% in Black individuals versus 3.1% in White
  individuals. However, among those who develop ALD, mortality rates do not significantly
  differ between racial groups, suggesting the protective effect operates at the disease
  development stage. The biological mechanisms underlying this disparity remain poorly
  characterized in the existing literature.'
