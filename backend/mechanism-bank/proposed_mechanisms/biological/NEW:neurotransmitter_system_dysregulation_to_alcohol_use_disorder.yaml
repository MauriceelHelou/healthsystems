  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic or heavy alcohol use causes short-term effects involving signaling
  mediated by multiple neurotransmitter systems including dopamine, corticotropin
  releasing factor (CRF), and glutamate'
- 'Step 2: Continued intoxication leads to progressive alterations and dysregulation
  of these neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 3: Neurotransmitter dysregulation causes alterations in neural pathways connecting
  prefrontal and limbic structures, affecting executive function, memory, and stress
  regulation'
- 'Step 4: These neurobiological changes drive the three-stage addiction cycle: binge/intoxication,
  withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation, perpetuating AUD'

  releasing factor, and glutamate signaling pathways, drives the development and perpetuation
  of alcohol use disorder through alterations in neural circuits connecting prefrontal
  and limbic structures that regulate executive function, memory, and stress responses.
