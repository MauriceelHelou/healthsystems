direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: rTMS delivers repetitive magnetic pulses to targeted brain regions, particularly
  the prefrontal cortex, which is implicated in impulse control and executive function'
- 'Step 2: The magnetic stimulation modulates neuronal activity and cortical excitability
  in regions involved in behavioral regulation and decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Theoretically, enhanced prefrontal cortex activity could strengthen top-down
  inhibitory control over impulsive responses'
- 'Step 4: However, current evidence from randomized controlled trials does not demonstrate
  statistically significant reduction in impulsivity in mental disorder patients (g=0.21,
  p=0.490)'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 rTMS randomized controlled
  trials (655 patients total) examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
  reduces impulsivity in mental disorder patients. The pooled effect size was not
  statistically significant (Hedges' g=0.21, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.80, p=0.490), indicating
  insufficient evidence that rTMS reduces impulsivity in this population. The theoretical
  mechanism involves modulating prefrontal cortex activity to enhance impulse control,
  but current RCT evidence does not support clinical use for this indication.
