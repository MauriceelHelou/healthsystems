  node_id: NEW:intestinal_permeability
  node_name: Intestinal Permeability
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Akkermansia muciniphila degrades mucin in the intestinal mucosa, which
  paradoxically stimulates mucus production and turnover'
- 'Step 2: This mucin degradation activity promotes a healthy mucus layer that serves
  as a physical barrier protecting the intestinal epithelium'
- 'Step 3: A. muciniphila produces metabolites and outer membrane proteins (like Amuc_1100)
  that strengthen tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced tight junction integrity and mucus barrier function result in
  reduced intestinal permeability (decreased ''leaky gut'')'
- 'Step 5: Reduced intestinal permeability prevents translocation of bacterial products
  and toxins into systemic circulation'

description: Akkermansia muciniphila, a Gram-negative commensal bacterium, modulates
  intestinal permeability through its mucin-degrading activity in the intestinal mucosa.
  Higher abundance of A. muciniphila is associated with improved intestinal barrier
  function and reduced permeability. Conversely, conditions that reduce A. muciniphila
  (such as chronic alcohol intake, obesity, or metabolic syndromes) are associated
  with impaired intestinal permeability. Supplementation with A. muciniphila has been
  shown to improve intestinal barrier integrity.
