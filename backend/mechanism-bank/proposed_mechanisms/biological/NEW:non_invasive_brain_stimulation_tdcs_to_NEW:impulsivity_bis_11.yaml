direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: tDCS delivers low-intensity electrical current to targeted brain regions,
  typically the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive function and impulse
  control'
- 'Step 2: The electrical stimulation modulates neuronal excitability and synaptic
  plasticity in the stimulated regions, enhancing activity in circuits associated
  with inhibitory control'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced prefrontal cortex activity strengthens top-down cognitive control
  mechanisms that regulate impulsive urges and behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Improved impulse control manifests as reduced scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness
  Scale (BIS-11), indicating decreased motor, attentional, and non-planning impulsivity'

description: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) shows a moderate effect
  in reducing impulsivity as measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)
  in patients with mental disorders. A meta-analysis of 9 tDCS RCTs found that active
  tDCS was associated with reduced BIS-11 scores compared to placebo, with a medium
  effect size (Hedges' g = -0.54) and no heterogeneity across studies. The mechanism
  involves neuromodulation of prefrontal cortical regions involved in executive function
  and impulse control.
