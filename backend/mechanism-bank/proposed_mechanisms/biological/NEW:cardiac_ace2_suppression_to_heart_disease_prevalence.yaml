mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ACE2 suppression in cardiac tissue reduces the conversion of Angiotensin
  II to Angiotensin 1-7, disrupting the protective counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin
  system'
- 'Step 2: Reduced ACE2 activity leads to accumulation of Angiotensin II in cardiac
  tissue, promoting vasoconstriction, inflammation, and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Loss of ACE2-mediated cardioprotection induces myocardial cell apoptosis
  and impairs cardiac remodeling processes'
- 'Step 4: Progressive cardiomyocyte death and dysfunction manifests as measurable
  cardiac dysfunction including reduced ejection fraction and impaired contractility'

description: Suppression of cardiac ACE2 leads to heart disease and cardiac dysfunction
  through disruption of the protective renin-angiotensin system counter-regulatory
  pathway. ACE2 normally converts harmful Angiotensin II to cardioprotective Angiotensin
  1-7. When ACE2 is suppressed (e.g., by miR-421 targeting), this protective mechanism
  is lost, leading to myocardial cell apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction. This was
  demonstrated in experimental models where ACE2 was identified as the downstream
  target mediating cardiac injury, and ACE2 activator treatment could reverse the
  dysfunction.
