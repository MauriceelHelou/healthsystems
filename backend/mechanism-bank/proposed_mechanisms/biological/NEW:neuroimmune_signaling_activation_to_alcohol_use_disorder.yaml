mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking and chronic alcohol exposure triggers release of HMGB1 (high
  mobility group box protein 1) from activated neurons and glial cells in the brain'
- 'Step 2: HMGB1, acting alone or in heteromers with other molecules, activates Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) and other innate immune receptors on microglia and neurons'
- 'Step 3: TLR activation initiates pro-inflammatory signaling cascades that spread
  across neuronal and glial networks, shifting gene transcription patterns'
- 'Step 4: Activated microglia regulate synapses through complement proteins, altering
  neuronal networks and reducing forebrain cholinergic neuron function'
- 'Step 5: These neuroimmune-induced changes to neuronal networks increase alcohol
  drinking behavior, anxiety, and cognitive disruption while promoting compulsive
  use patterns characteristic of AUD'

description: Neuroimmune signaling activation, particularly through the HMGB1-TLR
  pathway, contributes to the development of alcohol use disorder through a cascade
  of neuroinflammatory changes. Alcohol exposure triggers HMGB1 release, which activates
  TLRs on microglia and neurons, leading to pro-inflammatory signaling that alters
  synaptic function, reduces cholinergic neuron activity, and modifies neuronal networks.
  These changes promote increased alcohol drinking, anxiety, and cognitive deficits,
  creating a feed-forward cycle that contributes to compulsive alcohol use. Human
  postmortem AUD brain studies confirm elevated HMGB1 and TLR levels, supporting the
  clinical relevance of this mechanism.
