direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Deficiency in vitamins A, B3, B6, B9, B12, C, D, and E creates a lipotoxic
  hepatic environment, promoting excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes'
- 'Step 2: Vitamin deficiency leads to increased oxidative stress due to reduced antioxidant
  capacity (especially vitamins C and E), causing hepatocellular damage'
- 'Step 3: Altered immune function and unwarranted inflammation result from hypovitaminosis,
  triggering inflammatory cascades in liver tissue'
- 'Step 4: Vitamin deficiencies contribute to epigenetic modifications and gene mutations
  that affect lipid metabolism pathways'
- 'Step 5: Gut dysbiosis associated with vitamin deficiency further exacerbates hepatic
  inflammation and metabolic dysfunction'
- 'Step 6: These combined pathophysiologic processes promote progression from simple
  steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, and potentially cirrhosis'

description: Vitamin deficiency (A, B3, B6, B9, B12, C, D, E) has been associated
  with NAFLD development through multiple interconnected pathways. These vitamins
  influence hepatic lipid metabolism, oxidative stress responses, immune function,
  inflammation, epigenetic regulation, and gut microbiome composition. Hypovitaminosis
  creates a lipotoxic hepatic environment and reduces the liver's protective mechanisms
  against oxidative damage, promoting the progression from steatosis to more severe
  forms of liver disease including NASH, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
