mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis
  and lowering circulating LDL cholesterol levels'
- 'Step 2: Reduced LDL cholesterol decreases atherosclerotic plaque formation and
  progression in coronary and peripheral arteries'
- 'Step 3: Statins exert pleiotropic effects including anti-inflammatory properties
  that reduce systemic inflammation and vascular inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Statins demonstrate antifibrotic properties that may reduce arterial stiffness
  and improve vascular function'
- 'Step 5: These combined lipid-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects reduce the
  risk of cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, thereby
  lowering CVD mortality'

description: Statin therapy reduces cardiovascular disease mortality through multiple
  mechanisms. Statins are primarily known for their lipid-modulating effects, reducing
  LDL cholesterol through HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Additionally, statins exhibit
  anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties that provide cardiovascular protection
  beyond lipid lowering. In populations with NAFLD/NASH, where CVD represents the
  leading cause of mortality, statin therapy may be particularly beneficial. The review
  also notes potential benefits through modulation of gut microbiota, reducing systemic
  inflammation.

    mortality in this population
