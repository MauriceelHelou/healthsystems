direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant women are exposed to household PM2.5 pollution primarily from
  solid fuel combustion (wood, coal, dung, crop residues) used for cooking and heating'
- 'Step 2: Inhaled PM2.5 particles cross the alveolar-capillary barrier and enter
  maternal circulation, triggering systemic inflammation and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: PM2.5-induced inflammation and oxidative stress impair placental function,
  reducing nutrient and oxygen transfer to the developing fetus'
- 'Step 4: Compromised placental function leads to restricted fetal growth and reduced
  gestational weight gain'
- 'Step 5: The combination of direct toxicity and reduced nutrient/oxygen delivery
  results in low birth weight (<2500g)'

description: Meta-regression analysis of 40 studies found that PM2.5 exposure increases
  low birth weight risk by 11% per 10 μg/m³ increment. Globally, 15.6% of all LBW
  infants (approximately 2.76 million) were attributable to total PM2.5 in 2019. Household
  air pollution from solid fuel combustion dominates this burden in low-income countries.
  The mechanism involves maternal inhalation of fine particles leading to systemic
  inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired placental function, ultimately restricting
  fetal growth. An estimated 22 grams reduction in birth weight occurs per 10 μg/m³
  PM2.5 increment.
