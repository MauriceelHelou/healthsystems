mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hemodialysis patients receiving interferon-based HCV treatment experience
  high rates of adverse events due to altered drug pharmacokinetics and pre-existing
  comorbidities'
- 'Step 2: Flu-like syndrome occurs in approximately 41% of patients, causing significant
  discomfort and reduced quality of life'
- 'Step 3: Severe adverse events accumulate across multiple organ systems including
  hematological (cytopenia/anemia), thyroid dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems,
  cardiovascular complications, CNS effects, and infectious complications'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative burden of adverse events, particularly severe ones, leads
  to treatment discontinuation in approximately 11% of patients'

  HCV therapy lead to treatment discontinuation in approximately 11% of patients.
  Adverse events occur in less than 50% of documented cases but include severe multi-system
  complications: flu-like syndrome (41%), anemia requiring intervention, thyroid dysfunction,
  cytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiovascular problems, CNS effects, and
  infectious complications. The accumulated severity of these events necessitates
  treatment withdrawal.'
