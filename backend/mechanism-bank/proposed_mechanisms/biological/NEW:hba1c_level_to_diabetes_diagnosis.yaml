category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HbA1c reflects average blood glucose levels over 2-3 months through glycation
  of hemoglobin molecules'
- 'Step 2: Elevated HbA1c levels (≥6.5%) indicate sustained hyperglycemia consistent
  with diabetes diagnosis'
- 'Step 3: HbA1c serves as both a diagnostic marker and a measure of glycemic control
  in diabetes management'
- 'Step 4: Changes in HbA1c reflect the effectiveness of diabetes interventions, with
  reductions indicating improved disease control'

description: 'HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) serves as the primary biomarker for diabetes
  diagnosis and glycemic control. Elevated HbA1c levels directly reflect sustained
  hyperglycemia over 2-3 months, with levels ≥6.5% meeting diagnostic criteria for
  diabetes. This meta-analysis of 7 RCTs (413 participants) demonstrated that interventions
  targeting glucose control resulted in significant HbA1c reductions (MD = -1.32,
  95% CI: -2.06 to -0.57), confirming the direct relationship between HbA1c and diabetes
  status/control.'
