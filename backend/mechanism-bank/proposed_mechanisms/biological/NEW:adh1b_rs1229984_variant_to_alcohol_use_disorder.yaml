to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The ADH1B rs1229984 variant encodes a more active form of alcohol dehydrogenase
  enzyme that accelerates the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Rapid acetaldehyde accumulation causes aversive physiological effects including
  facial flushing, nausea, headache, and tachycardia after alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: These unpleasant experiences condition individuals to reduce or avoid alcohol
  consumption, serving as a protective mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption patterns decrease the likelihood of developing
  alcohol dependence and alcohol use disorder over time'

description: The ADH1B rs1229984 functional variant is a well-established protective
  factor against alcohol use disorder. This genome-wide meta-analysis in East Asian
  populations confirmed rs1229984 as one of two lead risk loci for AUD. The variant
  produces a more active alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme that rapidly converts ethanol
  to acetaldehyde, causing aversive physiological reactions that discourage alcohol
  consumption and reduce AUD risk.
