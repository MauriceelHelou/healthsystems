mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic hepatitis B virus infection causes persistent inflammation in liver
  tissue'
- 'Step 2: Ongoing hepatic inflammation leads to progressive fibrosis and scarring
  of liver tissue'
- 'Step 3: Advanced fibrosis progresses to liver cirrhosis with loss of functional
  hepatocytes'
- 'Step 4: Cirrhosis leads to liver failure, portal hypertension, and complications
  including hepatocellular carcinoma'
- 'Step 5: These complications result in increased mortality from liver disease'

description: Hepatitis B infection is a major driver of liver disease mortality, accounting
  for more than 60% of liver cirrhosis deaths in Iran (when combined with hepatitis
  C). The hepatitis B mortality rate is approximately four times higher than hepatitis
  C mortality rate. Chronic infection leads to progressive liver damage, cirrhosis,
  and ultimately death from liver failure or related complications.
