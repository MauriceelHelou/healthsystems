  node_name: Cardiovascular Disease Mortality
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NAFLD leads to hepatic insulin resistance and systemic metabolic dysfunction,
  promoting atherogenic dyslipidemia and chronic low-grade inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Liver-derived inflammatory mediators (cytokines, hepatokines) and procoagulant
  factors enter systemic circulation, promoting endothelial dysfunction and accelerated
  atherosclerosis'
- 'Step 3: High prevalence of comorbid metabolic syndrome (41.73%), cardiovascular
  disease (16.83%), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes in NAFLD patients compounds
  cardiovascular risk'
- 'Step 4: Progressive cardiovascular damage leads to increased incidence of cardiovascular
  events (24.77 per 1,000 person-years) and ultimately CVD-related mortality (4.53
  per 1,000 person-years)'

description: NAFLD is associated with increased cardiovascular disease mortality through
  multiple interconnected biological pathways. The meta-analysis of 79 studies (1,377,466
  persons) found CVD-related mortality incidence of 4.53 per 1,000 person-years in
  NAFLD patients. The mechanism involves hepatic metabolic dysfunction driving systemic
  inflammation, atherogenic lipid profiles, and insulin resistance. High baseline
  prevalence of metabolic comorbidities in NAFLD populations (metabolic syndrome 41.73%,
  CVD 16.83%) indicates shared pathophysiology and cumulative cardiovascular risk.
