direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term annual exposure to ground-level ozone leads to repeated oxidative
  stress in the respiratory tract through reaction with airway lining fluid and cellular
  membranes'
- 'Step 2: Chronic oxidative damage triggers persistent inflammation, epithelial injury,
  and impaired lung function over time'
- 'Step 3: Sustained inflammatory response and tissue damage contribute to progression
  and exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases including COPD and other respiratory
  conditions'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative respiratory system damage increases vulnerability to respiratory
  infections and complications, ultimately elevating respiratory disease mortality
  risk'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 cohort studies provides high
  certainty evidence that long-term annual ozone exposure is positively associated
  with respiratory disease mortality. The association was specifically confirmed for
  annual exposure metrics, with the biological mechanism involving chronic oxidative
  stress, airway inflammation, and progressive respiratory damage leading to increased
  mortality risk. This evidence informed the 2021 WHO Air Quality Guidelines and the
  Health Risks of Air Pollution in Europe project.
