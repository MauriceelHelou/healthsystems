direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Skeletal muscle dysfunction manifests through imbalance between anabolic
  and catabolic pathways, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy'
- 'Step 2: Reduced muscle regeneration capacity combined with increased inflammation
  and fibrosis impairs tissue repair and adaptation'
- 'Step 3: Deficiencies in energetic balance and mitochondrial function compromise
  muscle power output and endurance capacity'
- 'Step 4: Impaired muscle recovery after vigorous exercise extends recovery time
  and reduces training adaptation'
- 'Step 5: Collectively, these structural and functional deficits translate to measurable
  decrements in athletic performance'

description: Skeletal muscle dysfunction impairs athletic performance through multiple
  interconnected biological mechanisms including disrupted protein synthesis/degradation
  balance, compromised regeneration capacity, elevated inflammation, increased fibrosis,
  and mitochondrial dysfunction. These pathological features collectively reduce muscle
  strength, power output, and recovery capacity, directly translating to decrements
  in both amateur and professional athletic performance.
