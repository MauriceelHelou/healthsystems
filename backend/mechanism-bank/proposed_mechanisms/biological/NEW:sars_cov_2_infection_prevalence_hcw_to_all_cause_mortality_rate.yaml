  node_id: all_cause_mortality_rate
  node_name: All-Cause Mortality Rate
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare workers (HCW) are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 through direct patient
  care and occupational contact, leading to infection prevalence of approximately
  11% by RT-PCR and 7% by antibody testing'
- 'Step 2: Infected HCW develop COVID-19 disease, with 40% being asymptomatic at diagnosis
  but others progressing to symptomatic illness characterized by anosmia, fever, and
  myalgia'
- 'Step 3: Among COVID-19 positive HCW, approximately 5% develop severe clinical complications
  including respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: A subset of severely ill HCW (approximately 0.5%) die from COVID-19 complications,
  contributing directly to all-cause mortality'

description: SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers contributes to all-cause mortality
  through occupational exposure leading to COVID-19 infection, disease progression
  to severe complications in approximately 5% of cases, and death in approximately
  0.5% of infected HCW. This meta-analysis of 97 studies with over 230,000 HCW demonstrates
  a clear biological pathway from infection to mortality, with nurses and ward-based
  staff being disproportionately affected.
