direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive liver fibrosis leads to structural distortion of hepatic architecture
  with increasing collagen deposition and nodule formation'
- 'Step 2: Advanced fibrosis stages (F3-F4) result in impaired hepatic function including
  reduced synthetic capacity, detoxification, and metabolic regulation'
- 'Step 3: Progression to cirrhosis causes portal hypertension leading to complications
  including variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy'
- 'Step 4: These decompensation events and progressive hepatic failure contribute
  directly to increased mortality from liver disease'

description: Liver fibrosis stage is established as the best predictor of mortality
  in alcohol-related liver disease. This systematic review of 11 studies demonstrated
  that non-invasive tests measuring fibrosis (FIB4, ELF, FibroScan, FibroTest) consistently
  showed good prognostic performance for predicting mortality outcomes, with AUROC
  values generally exceeding 0.7 across all test categories. The biological mechanism
  reflects the progressive nature of liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
  hepatic decompensation, and ultimately death from liver-related causes.
