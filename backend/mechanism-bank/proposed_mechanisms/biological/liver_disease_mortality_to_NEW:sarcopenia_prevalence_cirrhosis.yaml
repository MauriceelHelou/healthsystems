direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive liver dysfunction in cirrhosis impairs hepatic protein synthesis
  and leads to metabolic derangements including hyperammonemia and altered amino acid
  metabolism'
- 'Step 2: Impaired nutrient absorption, reduced glycogen storage capacity, and chronic
  inflammation create a catabolic state favoring muscle protein breakdown'
- 'Step 3: As cirrhosis severity increases (measured by Child-Pugh classification),
  sarcopenia prevalence rises from approximately 37.5% overall to up to 50% in Child-Pugh
  class C patients'
- 'Step 4: The resultant muscle wasting (sarcopenia) becomes an independent predictor
  of mortality, with approximately 2-fold increased risk of death in cirrhotic patients
  with sarcopenia'

description: This meta-analysis demonstrates a strong dose-response relationship between
  cirrhosis severity and sarcopenia prevalence. The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia
  in cirrhotic patients is 37.5% overall, but increases substantially with disease
  severity, reaching approximately 50% in patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis
  or alcohol-associated liver disease. This relationship reflects the progressive
  metabolic deterioration in advanced liver disease that promotes muscle wasting through
  impaired protein synthesis, altered amino acid metabolism, and chronic catabolic
  states.
