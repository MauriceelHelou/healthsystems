direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) through
  ethanol metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 2E1 pathways'
- 'Step 2: Excessive ROS production leads to increased oxidant markers including malondialdehyde,
  thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and lipid peroxidation products'
- 'Step 3: Antioxidant defense systems become depleted, resulting in reduced superoxide
  dismutase activity and decreased total antioxidant capacity/status'
- 'Step 4: The imbalance between oxidant production and antioxidant defenses creates
  sustained oxidative stress state leading to cellular damage'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to oxidative stress imbalance through increased
  production of reactive oxygen species during ethanol metabolism and depletion of
  antioxidant defense systems. This meta-analysis found that individuals with substance
  use disorders, particularly alcohol use disorder, show significantly higher oxidant
  markers (malondialdehyde, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid peroxidation)
  and lower antioxidant markers (superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity)
  compared to healthy controls. Alcohol use disorder showed stronger oxidative stress
  effects than other substance use disorders.
