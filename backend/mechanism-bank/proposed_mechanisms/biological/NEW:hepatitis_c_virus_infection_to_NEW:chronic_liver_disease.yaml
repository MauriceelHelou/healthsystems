direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hepatitis C virus infects hepatocytes, establishing chronic infection in
  approximately 75-85% of infected individuals'
- 'Step 2: Persistent viral replication triggers ongoing hepatic inflammation and
  immune-mediated liver damage'
- 'Step 3: Repeated cycles of hepatocyte injury and regeneration promote progressive
  hepatic fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Continued fibrotic progression leads to cirrhosis and chronic liver disease'

  liver disease in Ethiopia, accounting for 15% of CLD cases. HCV establishes chronic
  infection leading to progressive hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis through persistent
  inflammation and immune-mediated hepatocyte damage.
