direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lean individuals develop NAFLD through metabolic dysfunction (insulin resistance,
  dyslipidemia) despite normal body weight, with genetic variants (PNPLA3, TM6SF2)
  potentially contributing to susceptibility'
- 'Step 2: Hepatic steatosis progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in
  up to 1 in 4 individuals with NAFLD, involving hepatocyte injury, inflammation,
  and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Persistent hepatic inflammation and injury drive progressive fibrosis through
  activation of hepatic stellate cells and extracellular matrix deposition'
- 'Step 4: Advanced fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis with portal hypertension, synthetic
  dysfunction, and risk of hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 5: Cirrhotic liver disease leads to complications including variceal bleeding,
  ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma, ultimately increasing
  liver-related mortality'

description: Lean NAFLD (affecting 7-20% of all NAFLD cases) is associated with increased
  liver-related mortality through progression to NASH, cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation,
  and hepatocellular carcinoma. Multiple studies demonstrate that lean individuals
  with NAFLD have increased liver mortality relative to those without NAFLD, highlighting
  that normal body weight does not confer protection against severe liver outcomes.
