direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Plasmodium infection triggers immune response, activating leukocytes including
  neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes'
- 'Step 2: Activated leukocytes produce and secrete IP-10/CXCL10 chemokine in response
  to interferon-γ signaling'
- 'Step 3: Elevated IP-10/CXCL10 recruits CXCR3+ T cells and other immune cells to
  sites of infection and inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Excessive IP-10/CXCL10-mediated immune cell recruitment contributes to
  immunopathology and tissue damage'
- 'Step 5: Dysregulated inflammatory response leads to increased disease severity,
  including progression to cerebral malaria and other severe manifestations'

description: IP-10/CXCL10, an interferon-γ-induced chemokine produced by activated
  leukocytes during Plasmodium infection, is elevated in malaria patients compared
  to healthy controls. Most evidence indicates that increased IP-10 levels are associated
  with greater disease severity, potentially through excessive immune cell recruitment
  and inflammatory immunopathology. The chemokine may serve as both a biomarker for
  disease severity and a mechanistic contributor to severe malaria pathogenesis, particularly
  in cerebral malaria.
