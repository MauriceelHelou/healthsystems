direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Shock states (septic, cardiogenic, or hypovolemic) cause systemic hypoperfusion
  and hemodynamic instability, leading to reduced renal blood flow'
- 'Step 2: Vasopressor administration (while necessary to maintain blood pressure)
  can cause renal vasoconstriction, further compromising renal perfusion'
- 'Step 3: Reduced renal perfusion leads to ischemic injury to renal tubular cells,
  activation of inflammatory cascades, and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 4: Sustained hypoperfusion and ischemia-reperfusion injury result in acute
  tubular necrosis and clinically manifest acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization'

description: Shock states and vasopressor use are significant risk factors for acute
  kidney injury in critically ill hospitalized patients. The meta-analysis found that
  after adjusting for shock or vasopressor use, differences in AKI rates between different
  viral infection groups disappeared, indicating that hemodynamic instability requiring
  vasopressor support is a critical pathway to AKI. Among 23,655 critically ill COVID-19
  patients, 51% developed AKI, with shock and vasopressor use identified as key confounders
  explaining differences in AKI rates across viral infections.
