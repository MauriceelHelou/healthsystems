direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic hazardous alcohol consumption initiates hepatic injury through
  direct hepatotoxic effects of ethanol and its metabolites (acetaldehyde)'
- 'Step 2: Initial liver damage manifests as hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), present
  in approximately 27% of hazardous drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol exposure triggers inflammatory responses, progressing
  to steatohepatitis (24% prevalence) with annualized progression rates of 10% to
  cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: Persistent inflammation leads to hepatic fibrosis (8% annual progression
  to cirrhosis) through activation of hepatic stellate cells and collagen deposition'
- 'Step 5: Progressive fibrosis culminates in cirrhosis (26% prevalence among hazardous
  drinkers), with associated mortality of 8% annually'

description: 'Systematic review of 37 studies (n=7,528) demonstrates that hazardous
  drinking leads to progressive alcohol-related liver disease through a stepwise histological
  progression. Among hazardous drinkers, 15% have normal histology, 27% steatosis,
  24% steatohepatitis, and 26% cirrhosis. Annual progression rates to cirrhosis increase
  with disease severity: 1% for normal histology, 3% for steatosis, 10% for steatohepatitis,
  and 8% for fibrosis. Steatohepatitis requiring hospitalization represents the most
  dangerous subtype with 15% annual mortality. Even ''benign'' steatosis carries significant
  mortality risk (6% annually), with non-liver mortality (5%) exceeding liver-specific
  mortality (1%).'
