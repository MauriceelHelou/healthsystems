- 'Step 1: Depression diagnosis is associated with chronic dysregulation of stress
  response systems and neurobiological alterations'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged exposure to elevated cortisol and inflammatory markers affects
  deep gray matter structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes manifest as measurable shape abnormalities
  in subcortical brain structures, detectable through neuroimaging techniques such
  as vertex-based shape analysis'

description: Depression diagnosis is associated with shape abnormalities in subcortical
  brain structures. This meta-analysis by the OCD Brain Imaging Consortium examined
  how comorbid depression affects subcortical morphology, finding that depression
  contributes to alterations in deep gray matter structure shape independent of primary
  psychiatric conditions. The relationship between depression and subcortical shape
  abnormalities reflects underlying neurobiological changes in key limbic and striatal
  regions.
