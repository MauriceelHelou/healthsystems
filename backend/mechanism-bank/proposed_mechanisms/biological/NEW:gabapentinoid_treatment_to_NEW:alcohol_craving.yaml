direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) bind to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated
  calcium channels in the central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: This binding reduces calcium influx and subsequently decreases the release
  of excitatory neurotransmitters including glutamate'
- 'Step 3: The reduction in glutamatergic hyperexcitability, which is elevated during
  alcohol withdrawal and abstinence, helps normalize brain reward circuitry'
- 'Step 4: Gabapentinoids also enhance GABAergic inhibitory tone, counteracting the
  GABA deficits associated with chronic alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: The combined effect of reduced excitatory and enhanced inhibitory neurotransmission
  decreases the neurobiological drive underlying alcohol craving'

description: Gabapentinoid treatment (gabapentin and pregabalin) reduces alcohol craving
  in patients with alcohol use disorder through modulation of voltage-gated calcium
  channels and enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. This systematic review
  and meta-analysis synthesized evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials
  examining the effects of gabapentinoids on craving and other AUD outcomes.
