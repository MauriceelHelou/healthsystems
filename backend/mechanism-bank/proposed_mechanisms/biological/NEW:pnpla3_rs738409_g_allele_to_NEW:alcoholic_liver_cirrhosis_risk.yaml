direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The PNPLA3 rs738409 C>G polymorphism results in an isoleucine to methionine
  substitution at position 148 (I148M) in the adiponutrin/patatin-like phospholipase
  domain-containing 3 protein'
- 'Step 2: The I148M variant impairs the lipase activity of PNPLA3, leading to reduced
  triglyceride hydrolysis in hepatocytes'
- 'Step 3: Accumulation of lipid droplets in liver cells promotes hepatic steatosis,
  which is exacerbated by alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects of alcohol toxicity and impaired lipid metabolism accelerate
  hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis progression'
- 'Step 5: Progressive fibrosis leads to increased risk of developing alcoholic liver
  cirrhosis, following an additive genetic model where each G allele incrementally
  increases risk'

description: The PNPLA3 rs738409 G allele (I148M variant) is strongly associated with
  increased risk of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. This meta-analysis of 11 studies including
  2087 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and 5038 controls demonstrates a clear
  dose-dependent relationship, with homozygous GG carriers having over 4-fold increased
  odds of developing cirrhosis compared to CC carriers. The association follows an
  additive genetic model, where each copy of the G allele incrementally increases
  cirrhosis risk.

  description: Association remains significant when comparing ALC patients vs alcoholics
    without ALD, indicating the variant modifies risk specifically in the context
    of alcohol exposure
