mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood maltreatment (physical, sexual, emotional abuse, neglect) exposes
  the developing brain to chronic traumatic stress during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Traumatic stress activates neurobiological stress response systems, potentially
  altering neural circuits involved in consciousness, memory integration, and self-awareness'
- 'Step 3: Dissociation develops as a psychological defense mechanism to cope with
  overwhelming traumatic experiences, fragmenting conscious awareness and memory'
- 'Step 4: Severity of childhood maltreatment correlates with degree of dissociative
  symptoms, which may persist into adulthood as a maladaptive coping pattern'
- 'Step 5: Dissociation becomes linked to other trauma-related symptoms including
  PTSD, emotional dysregulation, and maladaptive coping strategies'

description: Childhood maltreatment is significantly associated with dissociation,
  which appears to function as a 'bridge symptom' connecting early trauma to later
  psychological difficulties. Network analysis revealed dissociation as a central
  node linking childhood maltreatment experiences to PTSD symptoms, maladaptive coping
  (withdrawal, self-blame), and intimate partner violence. This suggests dissociation
  develops as a psychological response to overwhelming childhood trauma and may serve
  as a key mechanism through which early adversity influences later mental health
  and behavioral outcomes.
