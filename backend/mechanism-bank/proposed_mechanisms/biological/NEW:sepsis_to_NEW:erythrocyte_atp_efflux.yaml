mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sepsis induces systemic inflammatory response and microcirculatory dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory mediators and altered microenvironment affect red blood cell
  (erythrocyte) function and deformability'
- 'Step 3: Erythrocyte oxygen-sensing mechanisms become impaired, reducing the normal
  ATP release response to hypoxia'
- 'Step 4: Decreased ATP efflux from erythrocytes impairs local vasodilation signals
  that normally match oxygen delivery to tissue oxygen demand'
- 'Step 5: This contributes to impaired capillary response within hypoxic capillaries,
  worsening tissue oxygenation in sepsis'

description: Sepsis impairs the capillary response within hypoxic capillaries and
  decreases erythrocyte oxygen-dependent ATP efflux. Under normal physiological conditions,
  erythrocytes release ATP in response to hypoxia, which acts as a signaling molecule
  to induce local vasodilation and improve oxygen delivery. In sepsis, this oxygen-sensing
  and ATP release mechanism is compromised, contributing to microcirculatory dysfunction
  and inadequate tissue oxygenation despite potentially adequate systemic oxygen delivery.
