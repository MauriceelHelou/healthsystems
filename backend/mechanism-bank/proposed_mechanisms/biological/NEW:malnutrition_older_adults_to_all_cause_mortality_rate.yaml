direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Malnutrition in older adults leads to protein-energy deficits, micronutrient
  deficiencies, and compromised immune function'
- 'Step 2: Impaired nutritional status reduces physiological reserves, muscle mass
  (sarcopenia), and wound healing capacity'
- 'Step 3: Following acute health events such as hip fractures, malnourished older
  adults experience higher rates of complications including delirium, infections,
  and delayed recovery'
- 'Step 4: Reduced functional capacity and increased complication rates lead to prolonged
  hospitalization, loss of independence, and transfer to more supported living arrangements'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effects of poor recovery, complications, and frailty result
  in significantly elevated mortality risk at both short-term (1 month) and long-term
  (1 year) timepoints'

description: Malnutrition in older adults significantly increases all-cause mortality
  risk, with meta-analytic evidence from 14 studies showing 3.4-3.7 fold increased
  odds of death. This relationship is mediated through compromised physiological reserves,
  impaired recovery from acute events, increased complication rates (including delirium),
  and reduced functional independence. Effects are observed both in short-term (1
  month) and long-term (1 year) follow-up periods.

    malnutrition effects on mortality are particularly pronounced due to surgical
