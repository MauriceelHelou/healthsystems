direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heart failure patients accumulate multiple comorbid conditions (diabetes,
  COPD, CKD, stroke, ischemic heart disease, anemia, cancer, atrial fibrillation,
  dementia, depression) due to shared risk factors, aging, and pathophysiological
  interconnections'
- 'Step 2: Each comorbid condition creates additional physiological burden through
  organ dysfunction, metabolic derangements, systemic inflammation, and compromised
  compensatory mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Multiple comorbidities interact synergistically to accelerate cardiovascular
  decline, reduce functional reserve, and complicate treatment regimens'
- 'Step 4: Comorbidity burden impairs self-care capacity, treatment adherence, and
  health-related quality of life, further compromising disease management'
- 'Step 5: The cumulative effect of multiple organ system dysfunction and reduced
  physiological reserve leads to increased all-cause mortality risk'

description: Comorbidity burden in heart failure patients significantly increases
  all-cause mortality risk through cumulative physiological stress, organ system dysfunction,
  and compromised compensatory mechanisms. A meta-analysis of 39 studies found that
  presence of comorbid conditions in HF patients is associated with 31% increased
  hazard of all-cause mortality (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.18-1.45). Ten specific comorbidities
  (diabetes, COPD, CKD, stroke, ischemic heart disease, anemia, cancer, atrial fibrillation,
  dementia, and depression) were identified as having significant negative effects
  on prognostic outcomes.
