direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-alcoholic liver disease alters bile acid metabolism and secretion,
  reducing the antimicrobial properties of bile in the small intestine'
- 'Step 2: Liver dysfunction impairs intestinal motility through autonomic nervous
  system dysregulation and reduced clearance of bacterial metabolites'
- 'Step 3: Portal hypertension and altered gut-liver axis signaling lead to intestinal
  barrier dysfunction and mucosal immune changes'
- 'Step 4: These changes create a favorable environment for pathological bacterial
  overgrowth in the small intestine, with SIBO prevalence reaching approximately 35%
  in NAFLD patients'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies (n=1,263) demonstrates
  that approximately 35% of patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases develop small
  intestinal bacterial overgrowth. The gut-liver axis is bidirectionally disrupted
  in NAFLD, with liver dysfunction promoting conditions favorable for bacterial overgrowth
  in the small intestine through altered bile acid metabolism, impaired intestinal
  motility, and mucosal immune dysfunction. The prevalence of SIBO is particularly
  elevated in NASH patients and increases with the proportion of males in the study
  population.
