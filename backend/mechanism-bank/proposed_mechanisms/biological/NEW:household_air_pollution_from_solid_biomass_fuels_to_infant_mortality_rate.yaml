to_node:
  node_id: infant_mortality_rate
  node_name: Infant Mortality Rate
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Combustion of solid biomass fuels (wood, charcoal, crop residues, dung)
  for cooking, heating, and lighting releases harmful pollutants including particulate
  matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
  into the household environment'
- 'Step 2: Infants experience high exposure levels due to proximity to cooking areas
  and time spent indoors, combined with their higher respiratory rates relative to
  body size'
- 'Step 3: Inhaled pollutants cause oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and damage
  to developing respiratory tissues in infants'
- 'Step 4: These biological insults lead to increased susceptibility to acute lower
  respiratory infections (pneumonia), impaired lung development, and other adverse
  health outcomes'
- 'Step 5: Severe respiratory infections and compromised respiratory function contribute
  to elevated infant mortality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with
  limited healthcare access'

description: Household air pollution from solid biomass fuel combustion exposes infants
  to high levels of particulate matter and toxic gases, causing respiratory damage
  and inflammation. This biological vulnerability, combined with increased susceptibility
  to respiratory infections like pneumonia, leads to elevated infant mortality rates,
  particularly in low- and middle-income countries where such fuel use is common.
