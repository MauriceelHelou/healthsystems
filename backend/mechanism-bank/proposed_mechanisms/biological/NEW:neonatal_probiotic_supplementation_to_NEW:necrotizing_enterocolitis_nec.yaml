direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Probiotic supplementation introduces beneficial bacterial strains to the
  neonatal gut, establishing or enhancing colonization with protective microorganisms'
- 'Step 2: Probiotics competitively exclude pathogenic bacteria, reduce intestinal
  permeability, and strengthen the gut mucosal barrier function'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced gut barrier integrity and balanced microbiome reduce bacterial
  translocation and inflammatory responses in the immature intestinal tissue'
- 'Step 4: Reduced intestinal inflammation and improved mucosal defense mechanisms
  decrease the risk of ischemic necrosis of the bowel characteristic of NEC'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 randomized controlled trials
  (n=5,574 participants) demonstrates that neonatal probiotic supplementation reduces
  the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis by 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.59) compared
  to controls. This represents a number needed to treat of 17 to prevent one case
  of NEC. The evidence quality is rated high by GRADE criteria with low statistical
  heterogeneity (I²=24%) and symmetrical funnel plot. The protective effect is most
  pronounced in preterm and low birth weight infants in hospital settings.
