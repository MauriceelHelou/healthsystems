direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cirrhosis leads to metabolic dysfunction including impaired protein synthesis,
  hyperammonemia, and systemic inflammation, which contribute to skeletal muscle wasting
  (sarcopenia)'
- 'Step 2: Sarcopenia reflects severe catabolic state and depleted physiological reserves,
  compromising the body''s ability to respond to metabolic stressors, infections,
  and disease complications'
- 'Step 3: Reduced muscle mass impairs immune function, respiratory capacity, and
  physical performance, increasing vulnerability to complications such as infections,
  hepatic encephalopathy, and respiratory failure'
- 'Step 4: Sarcopenic patients have diminished capacity to tolerate treatments including
  liver transplantation and interventions for portal hypertension, leading to worse
  outcomes'
- 'Step 5: The combination of reduced functional reserve and increased complication
  risk results in approximately 2-fold higher mortality risk in cirrhotic patients
  with sarcopenia'

description: Sarcopenia, affecting approximately 37.5% of patients with cirrhosis,
  is independently associated with a 2.3-fold increased risk of mortality. This association
  persists across patient subgroups stratified by sex, underlying liver disease etiology,
  and severity of hepatic dysfunction. The relationship is supported by quantitative
  muscle mass index analysis showing continuous association between muscle mass and
  survival. Higher prevalence observed in males, alcohol-related liver disease, and
  advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C).
