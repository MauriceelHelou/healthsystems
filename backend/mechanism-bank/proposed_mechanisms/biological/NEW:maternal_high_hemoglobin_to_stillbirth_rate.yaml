  node_id: stillbirth_rate

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated maternal hemoglobin concentrations (≥130 g/L) indicate increased
  blood viscosity and reduced plasma volume expansion during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Increased blood viscosity impairs uteroplacental blood flow and oxygen
  delivery to the fetus'
- 'Step 3: Reduced placental perfusion leads to placental insufficiency and compromised
  fetal oxygenation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic fetal hypoxia and nutrient deprivation increase risk of intrauterine
  fetal demise (stillbirth)'

description: High maternal hemoglobin concentration (≥130 g/L) during pregnancy is
  significantly associated with increased risk of stillbirth (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.60).
  This association likely reflects underlying pathophysiology related to inadequate
  plasma volume expansion, increased blood viscosity, and compromised uteroplacental
  circulation leading to fetal compromise.
