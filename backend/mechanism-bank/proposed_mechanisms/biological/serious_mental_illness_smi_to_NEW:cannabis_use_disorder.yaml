category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with serious mental illness (including schizophrenia, psychotic
  disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders) experience neurobiological dysregulation
  affecting reward, stress, and emotional processing systems'
- 'Step 2: Mental illness symptoms create vulnerability through self-medication attempts,
  altered dopaminergic signaling, and disrupted endocannabinoid system function'
- 'Step 3: Cannabis use provides temporary symptom relief or hedonic effects, but
  individuals with SMI show increased susceptibility to developing dependence'
- 'Step 4: Comorbid cannabis use disorder develops at higher rates among those with
  mental illness compared to general population, with sex-specific patterns across
  diagnoses'

description: Serious mental illness significantly increases risk of developing cannabis
  use disorder, with the systematic review of 37 studies showing consistent comorbidity
  patterns. Males with schizophrenia are approximately 2.6 times more likely to have
  comorbid CUD. The relationship varies by specific mental illness diagnosis and sex,
  with females showing increased vulnerability to CUD when mental illness is present
  (except for psychotic disorders and depression).

    illness increases CUD likelihood except for psychotic disorders and depression.
