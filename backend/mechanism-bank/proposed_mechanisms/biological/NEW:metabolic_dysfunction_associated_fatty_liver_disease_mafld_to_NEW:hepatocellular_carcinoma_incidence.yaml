direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MAFLD develops through metabolic dysfunction characterized by hepatic steatosis
  combined with markers of metabolic dysfunction (obesity, type 2 diabetes, or metabolic
  dysregulation)'
- 'Step 2: Chronic hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress from lipid accumulation
  leads to progressive liver damage, promoting hepatocyte injury and regeneration
  cycles'
- 'Step 3: Sustained metabolic stress and inflammation drive fibrosis progression,
  which can advance to cirrhosis in many cases'
- 'Step 4: The pro-oncogenic microenvironment created by chronic inflammation, insulin
  resistance, and lipotoxicity promotes hepatocellular transformation and carcinogenesis'
- 'Step 5: MAFLD contributes to HCC both as a sole etiology (single-MAFLD) and as
  a co-factor potentiating other liver diseases (mixed-MAFLD), with nearly half of
  all HCC cases having MAFLD involvement'

description: MAFLD is a major contributor to hepatocellular carcinoma, with nearly
  half (48.7%) of all HCC cases having MAFLD involvement. MAFLD can act as the sole
  cause of HCC (12.4% of cases) or more commonly as a contributory co-factor in mixed-etiology
  HCC. The metabolic dysfunction underlying MAFLD creates a pro-carcinogenic hepatic
  environment through chronic inflammation, lipotoxicity, and often cirrhosis development.
