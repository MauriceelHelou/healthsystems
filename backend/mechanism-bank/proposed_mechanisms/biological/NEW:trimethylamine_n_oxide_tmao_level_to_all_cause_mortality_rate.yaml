  node_id: all_cause_mortality_rate

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gut microbiota metabolize dietary nutrients (choline, carnitine, betaine
  from red meat, eggs, fish) to produce trimethylamine (TMA)'
- 'Step 2: TMA is absorbed and oxidized to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) by hepatic
  flavin monooxygenases'
- 'Step 3: Elevated circulating TMAO promotes inflammation, as evidenced by positive
  correlation with inflammatory biomarkers (r = 0.43)'
- 'Step 4: TMAO contributes to kidney dysfunction and is inversely correlated with
  glomerular filtration rate (r = -0.49), creating a vicious cycle in CKD patients'
- 'Step 5: TMAO promotes cardiovascular damage through pro-atherogenic effects, endothelial
  dysfunction, and platelet hyperreactivity'
- 'Step 6: Combined kidney-heart damage from chronic TMAO elevation increases risk
  of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality'

description: Elevated circulating trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived
  metabolite, is linearly associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in chronic
  kidney disease patients. This meta-analysis of 21 studies (n=15,637) demonstrates
  that highest TMAO concentrations increase mortality risk by 26% in non-dialysis
  CKD patients and 62% in non-black dialysis patients. The mechanism involves TMAO-induced
  inflammation, impaired kidney function, and cardiovascular damage.
