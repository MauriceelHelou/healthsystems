direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in AUD leads to direct neurotoxic effects on
  neurons and supporting glial cells'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation disrupt normal neurotrophin
  synthesis and release mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: BDNF levels become significantly reduced during active alcohol consumption,
  impairing synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival'
- 'Step 4: GDNF dysregulation affects dopaminergic neuron function, contributing to
  reward pathway dysfunction and addiction maintenance'
- 'Step 5: NGF depletion reduces neuronal protection against ethanol-induced cytotoxic
  damage, exacerbating neurodegeneration'
- 'Step 6: NT-3 levels decrease after alcohol exposure, compromising compensatory
  mechanisms for cognitive decline'
- 'Step 7: NT-4 alterations contribute to oxidative stress associated with chronic
  alcohol consumption, creating a feedback loop of neuronal damage'

description: Alcohol use disorder causes significant alterations in multiple neurotrophin
  levels including BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT-3, and NT-4. These changes reflect alcohol-induced
  neurodegeneration and impaired neuroplasticity. BDNF is significantly reduced during
  active consumption and may serve as a biomarker for relapse susceptibility. GDNF
  dysfunction affects dopaminergic reward pathways central to addiction. NGF depletion
  reduces neuroprotection against alcohol toxicity. NT-3 and NT-4 alterations contribute
  to cognitive decline and oxidative stress. These neurotrophin alterations partially
  reverse during abstinence but may contribute to withdrawal syndrome severity.
