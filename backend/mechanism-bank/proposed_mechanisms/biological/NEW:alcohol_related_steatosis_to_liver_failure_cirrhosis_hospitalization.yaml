mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to alcohol-related steatosis (fatty liver),
  characterized by fat accumulation in hepatocytes'
- 'Step 2: Continued alcohol exposure in the presence of steatosis promotes oxidative
  stress, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory cytokine release'
- 'Step 3: Persistent inflammation can progress to alcohol-related steatohepatitis
  (ASH) with hepatocyte injury and immune cell infiltration'
- 'Step 4: Repeated cycles of injury and repair activate hepatic stellate cells, leading
  to progressive fibrosis'
- 'Step 5: Progressive fibrosis ultimately results in cirrhosis with architectural
  distortion, nodule formation, and impaired liver function'

description: Alcohol-related steatosis represents the most common and earliest stage
  of alcohol-related liver disease (ArLD). While associated with a relatively low
  annual progression rate to cirrhosis (approximately 3% per year), it serves as the
  necessary precursor stage in the disease continuum. The progression involves ongoing
  hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrogenesis that can ultimately lead to cirrhosis.
  Notably, patients with alcohol-related steatosis have higher rates of non-liver-related
  morbidity (4% per year) compared to liver-related complications (1% per year), but
  progression to cirrhosis significantly worsens outcomes.
