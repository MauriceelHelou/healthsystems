  node_name: All-Cause Mortality Rate
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Eating disorders (AN, BN, BED, OSFED) cause severe nutritional deficiencies,
  electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic dysregulation through restrictive eating,
  purging behaviors, or binge eating patterns'
- 'Step 2: Chronic malnutrition and purging behaviors lead to multi-organ damage including
  cardiac complications (arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy), renal dysfunction, bone loss,
  and immune suppression'
- 'Step 3: Psychiatric comorbidities including depression, anxiety, and self-injurious
  behaviors increase suicide risk and reduce treatment adherence'
- 'Step 4: High chronicity rates (25% of patients) and diagnostic migration patterns
  perpetuate physiological stress and organ damage over extended periods'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative physiological damage, medical complications, and elevated suicide
  risk result in increased all-cause mortality (5.2 deaths per 1,000 person-years)'

description: Eating disorders significantly increase all-cause mortality through multiple
  pathways including severe malnutrition, metabolic complications, cardiac dysfunction,
  and elevated suicide risk. Meta-analysis of 214 studies (N=88,372) found mortality
  rate of 5.2 deaths per 1,000 person-years across ED types, with substantial variation
  by diagnosis. High chronicity rates (25%) and low recovery rates perpetuate physiological
  damage. Treatment access and type significantly moderate outcomes.
