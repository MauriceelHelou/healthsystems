mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ammonia-targeting pharmacotherapies (sodium benzoate, glycerol phenylbutyrate,
  ornithine phenylacetate, AST-120, polyethylene glycol) are administered to patients
  with cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: These drugs act through various mechanisms to reduce ammonia: sodium benzoate
  conjugates with glycine to form hippurate (excreted renally), glycerol phenylbutyrate
  and ornithine phenylacetate enhance nitrogen excretion via alternative pathways,
  AST-120 adsorbs ammonia in the gut, and polyethylene glycol promotes ammonia elimination
  through catharsis'
- 'Step 3: Through these mechanisms, blood ammonia concentrations are reduced compared
  to placebo, though the magnitude of reduction and clinical significance remain uncertain'

description: Ammonia-targeting pharmacotherapies have the potential to reduce blood
  ammonia concentrations compared to placebo in adults with cirrhosis. These drugs
  work through various mechanisms including conjugation, enhanced nitrogen excretion,
  gut adsorption, and catharsis. However, the evidence is of very low certainty due
  to high risk of bias in most trials, and the overall clinical benefit remains uncertain.
