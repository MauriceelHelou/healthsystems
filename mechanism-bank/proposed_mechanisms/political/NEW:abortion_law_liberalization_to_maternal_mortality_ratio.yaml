- 'Step 1: Legislative reform expands legal grounds for abortion, transitioning from
  highly restrictive to relatively liberal abortion laws'
- 'Step 2: Legal access enables women to seek safe abortion services from trained
  healthcare providers in regulated facilities'
- 'Step 3: Reduction in unsafe clandestine abortions decreases complications such
  as hemorrhage, sepsis, and uterine perforation'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of abortion-related complications translate to reduced maternal
  morbidity and mortality'

description: Systematic review of 13 studies using quasi-experimental designs (pre-post,
  interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, synthetic control) found that
  legislative reforms transitioning from highly restrictive to relatively liberal
  abortion laws in LMICs were associated with lower maternal mortality. The mechanism
  operates through increased access to safe, legal abortion services, which reduces
  unsafe abortion practices and their associated complications.
