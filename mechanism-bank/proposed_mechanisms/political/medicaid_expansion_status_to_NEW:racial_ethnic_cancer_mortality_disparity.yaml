direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medicaid expansion increases health insurance coverage among previously
  uninsured populations, particularly affecting racial and ethnic minority groups
  who have historically higher uninsured rates'
- 'Step 2: Increased insurance coverage improves access to cancer treatment, including
  timely diagnosis, standard therapies, and supportive care for patients with advanced
  malignancies'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced healthcare access leads to greater reductions in cancer mortality
  among racial/ethnic minority patients compared to White patients, thereby narrowing
  the mortality disparity gap'
- 'Step 4: The effect is most pronounced among patients in the lowest income quartile,
  where Medicaid expansion eliminates or reverses the pre-existing survival disadvantage
  experienced by minority patients'

description: Medicaid expansion is associated with a significant reduction in racial/ethnic
  cancer mortality disparities. In states that expanded Medicaid, the survival advantage
  previously observed for White patients compared to racial/ethnic minority patients
  with de novo stage IV breast cancer was eliminated in the post-expansion period.
  Minority patients experienced a greater reduction in 2-year mortality compared to
  White patients, with the disparity-reducing effect being most pronounced among the
  lowest income patients.
