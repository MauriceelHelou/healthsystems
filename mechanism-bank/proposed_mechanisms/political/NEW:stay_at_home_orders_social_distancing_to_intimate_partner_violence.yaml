mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stay-at-home orders and social distancing mandates require individuals
  to remain in their residences for extended periods, limiting movement outside the
  home'
- 'Step 2: Forced cohabitation increases contact time between intimate partners, including
  those in abusive relationships, while simultaneously isolating victims from external
  support networks (family, friends, coworkers)'
- 'Step 3: Economic stressors, job losses, and uncertainty during pandemic conditions
  exacerbate household tensions and conflict triggers'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to support services, shelters, and reporting mechanisms
  during lockdowns limits victims'' ability to seek help or escape'
- 'Step 5: The combination of increased exposure to abusers, isolation from protective
  factors, and heightened stress results in elevated rates of physical, sexual, emotional,
  and economic intimate partner violence'

description: Stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures implemented during
  the COVID-19 pandemic created conditions that increased intimate partner violence.
  A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies found that approximately 31%
  of women experienced IPV during the pandemic period. The mechanism operates through
  forced cohabitation that increases victim exposure to abusers while simultaneously
  cutting off access to social support networks, protective services, and escape options.
  All forms of IPV (physical, sexual, emotional, and economic) were prevalent during
  this period.
