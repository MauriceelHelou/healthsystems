direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol taxation increase raises the price of alcohol, reducing affordability
  across all population segments'
- 'Step 2: Lower educated populations, who tend to have higher rates of harmful alcohol
  consumption and are more price-sensitive, experience greater reductions in alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption leads to decreased alcohol-attributable mortality,
  particularly from injuries and infectious diseases, which disproportionately affect
  lower educated groups'
- 'Step 4: As mortality declines more sharply among lower educated populations compared
  to higher educated populations, the education-based mortality gap narrows'

description: Increased alcohol taxation reduces education-based mortality inequalities
  by disproportionately reducing alcohol-attributable deaths among lower educated
  populations. In Lithuania, the 2017 taxation increase was associated with a 13%
  reduction in mortality inequalities among men, primarily through decreased deaths
  from injuries and infectious diseases in lower educated groups.
