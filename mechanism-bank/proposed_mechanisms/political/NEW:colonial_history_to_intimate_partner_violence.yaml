mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Colonial history creates and perpetuates structural inequalities that persist
  in post-colonial nations, including economic underdevelopment and resource extraction
  patterns'
- 'Step 2: Colonialism reinforces and institutionalizes patriarchal gender norms and
  power structures that subordinate women'
- 'Step 3: Post-colonial contexts cluster with high homicide rates, younger population
  age distributions, and higher prevalence of drug use disorders, creating environments
  conducive to violence'
- 'Step 4: These intersecting structural factors (patriarchy, socioeconomic inequality,
  weak institutions) elevate risk contexts that facilitate intimate partner violence
  against women'

description: Latent class analysis of 190 countries (5,732 country-years) identified
  that post-colonial nations cluster into high-risk contexts for intimate partner
  violence, characterized by patriarchal gender norms, high homicide rates, and broader
  structural inequalities. These 'patriarchal post-colonial' risk contexts demonstrate
  significantly higher IPV prevalence compared to non-patriarchal egalitarian contexts,
  suggesting colonial history creates enduring structural conditions that facilitate
  violence against women.
