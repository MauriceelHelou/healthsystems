mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative reforms expand legal grounds for abortion, shifting from highly
  restrictive to relatively liberal abortion laws'
- 'Step 2: Expanded legal access increases women''s ability to access safe abortion
  services without legal barriers'
- 'Step 3: Women gain greater reproductive autonomy and ability to control timing
  and number of pregnancies'
- 'Step 4: Increased access to legal abortion services allows women to terminate unwanted
  pregnancies that would otherwise result in births'
- 'Step 5: Aggregate fertility rates decline as fewer unwanted pregnancies are carried
  to term, particularly among women aged 20-34 years'

description: Systematic review of 13 studies from low- and middle-income countries
  found that legislative reforms from highly restrictive to relatively liberal abortion
  laws were associated with reductions in fertility rates. The review included studies
  using pre-post, interrupted time series, difference-in-differences, and synthetic
  control designs across multiple countries. The effect was particularly notable among
  women of prime reproductive age (20-34 years).
