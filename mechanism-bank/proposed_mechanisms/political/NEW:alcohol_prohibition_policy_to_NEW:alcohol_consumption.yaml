- 'Step 1: Government enacts alcohol prohibition policy, legally restricting the production,
  sale, and distribution of alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Reduced legal availability of alcohol decreases population-level access
  to alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 3: Decreased access leads to reduced overall alcohol consumption at the population
  level'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption manifests as decreased liver cirrhosis mortality
  rates (proxy measure for consumption)'

description: Alcohol prohibition policies reduce population-level alcohol consumption
  by restricting legal access to alcoholic beverages. This time-series analysis of
  seven Canadian provinces from 1901-1956 found that prohibition was associated with
  0.39 fewer liver cirrhosis deaths per 100,000 people (used as proxy measure for
  consumption). While prohibition did not eliminate alcohol consumption entirely,
  the evidence suggests meaningful reductions at the population level.
