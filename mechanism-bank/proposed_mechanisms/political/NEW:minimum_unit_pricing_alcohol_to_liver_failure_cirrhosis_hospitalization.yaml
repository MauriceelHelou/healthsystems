mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing (MUP) establishes a legally required floor price per
  unit of alcohol, increasing the cost of the cheapest alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Price increases disproportionately affect heavy drinkers who tend to purchase
  cheaper, high-strength alcohol products'
- 'Step 3: Reduced affordability leads to decreased alcohol consumption, particularly
  among the heaviest consumers from the most deprived groups'
- 'Step 4: Sustained reduction in alcohol consumption decreases cumulative hepatotoxic
  exposure to the liver over time'
- 'Step 5: Reduced hepatotoxic burden leads to decreased progression of alcohol-related
  liver disease and reduced need for hospitalization (with a 2-3 year lag for chronic
  conditions)'

description: Minimum unit pricing for alcohol reduces alcohol-related liver disease
  hospitalizations by establishing a price floor that disproportionately increases
  costs for heavy drinkers of cheap, high-strength products. This systematic review
  of 22 studies (6 natural experiments and 16 modelling studies) found that MUP reduces
  chronic alcohol-related admissions by 4-9% annually, with effects appearing 2-3
  years after implementation. The Bradford Hill Criteria analysis inferred a 'moderate-to-strong'
  causal link between MUP and reduced alcohol-related hospitalization.
