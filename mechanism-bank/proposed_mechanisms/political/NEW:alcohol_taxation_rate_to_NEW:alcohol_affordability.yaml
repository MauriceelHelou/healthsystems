- 'Step 1: Government implements alcohol taxation increase (excise tax policy)'
- 'Step 2: Higher taxes are passed through to retail prices of alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 3: Increased prices relative to income reduce the affordability of alcohol
  for consumers'
- 'Step 4: Reduced affordability leads to decreased alcohol consumption, particularly
  among price-sensitive populations'

description: Alcohol taxation increases directly reduce alcohol affordability by raising
  retail prices. This economic mechanism operates through standard price elasticity
  of demand, where higher prices relative to consumer income make alcohol less affordable.
  The 2017 Lithuanian taxation increase demonstrated this pathway, with subsequent
  reductions in alcohol-related mortality, particularly among lower socioeconomic
  groups who are more price-sensitive.
