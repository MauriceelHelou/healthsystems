direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with acute coronary symptoms hesitated
  to present at hospitals due to fear of infection, lockdown measures, and healthcare
  system messaging to avoid emergency departments'
- 'Step 2: This hesitation resulted in prolonged symptom-to-first-medical-contact
  time, delaying critical early intervention for myocardial infarction'
- 'Step 3: Delayed presentation led to longer door-to-balloon times for those who
  eventually sought care, reducing effectiveness of reperfusion therapy'
- 'Step 4: The combination of delayed care and missed treatment windows resulted in
  worse outcomes including higher mortality rates (10-76% with COVID-19 vs 4.6-7%
  without) and increased severity of myocardial damage'

description: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients experiencing acute myocardial
  infarction symptoms delayed seeking hospital care due to fear of contracting COVID-19
  in healthcare settings. This behavioral response, documented as 'patients' hesitation
  in presenting at the hospital,' resulted in prolonged symptom-to-first-medical-contact
  times and longer door-to-balloon times. These delays compromised the effectiveness
  of time-sensitive interventions like primary percutaneous coronary intervention,
  leading to worse short and long-term outcomes including increased cardiovascular
  mortality.
