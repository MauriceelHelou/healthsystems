direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to patterns of harmful drinking including binge
  drinking and everyday drinking that impair physical and cognitive functioning'
- 'Step 2: Impaired functioning results in increased absenteeism due to hangovers,
  alcohol-related illness, and recovery time from drinking episodes'
- 'Step 3: Workers with alcohol use disorder who do attend work experience presenteeism
  - reduced productivity while present due to cognitive impairment, fatigue, and withdrawal
  symptoms'
- 'Step 4: In safety-sensitive occupations (e.g., truck driving), alcohol misuse additionally
  increases risk of workplace injuries and accidents, further contributing to productivity
  losses'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis establishes that alcohol use
  disorder, as measured by AUDIT/CAGE instruments, is directly linked to occupational
  productivity losses through absenteeism, presenteeism, and workplace injuries. Among
  truck drivers, 22.7% met criteria for alcohol misuse, with additional patterns of
  binge drinking (19.0%) and everyday drinking (9.4%) contributing to impaired work
  performance and safety risks.
