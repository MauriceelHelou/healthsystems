direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare providers conduct liver biomarker tests (e.g., GGT, liver function
  tests) or non-invasive fibrosis assessments on individuals with high-risk alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 2: Test results are shared with patients along with personalized advice explaining
  the relationship between their drinking patterns and observed liver changes'
- 'Step 3: Personalized biomarker feedback creates cognitive dissonance and increases
  perceived personal risk of alcohol-related harm'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced risk perception and tangible evidence of physiological harm motivates
  behavior change'
- 'Step 5: Individuals reduce harmful alcohol consumption, leading to measurable decreases
  in weekly alcohol intake'

description: Providing advice based on liver biomarkers or non-invasive fibrosis tests
  significantly reduces harmful alcohol consumption. A meta-analysis of 14 RCTs and
  2 observational studies found that intervention-based advice led to a mean reduction
  of 74.4 grams of alcohol per week compared to control groups. This was accompanied
  by reductions in GGT levels (-19.7 IU/l) and lower rates of alcohol-attributed mortality,
  hospitalizations, and physician visits in intervention groups.
