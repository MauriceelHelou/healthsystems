direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Engagement in regular aerobic exercise increases cardiovascular activity
  and oxygen uptake (VO2 max)'
- 'Step 2: Aerobic activity stimulates neurobiological changes including increased
  endorphin release, enhanced neurotransmitter regulation (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine),
  and reduced cortisol levels'
- 'Step 3: These physiological changes, combined with improved physical fitness and
  potential psychosocial benefits (self-efficacy, distraction from negative thoughts),
  contribute to alleviation of depressive symptoms'

description: Meta-analytic evidence from interventional studies suggests that aerobic
  exercise has a negative (beneficial) effect on depression symptoms, particularly
  among individuals with alcohol use disorders. While the overall meta-analysis did
  not find statistically significant changes in depression levels across all exercise
  types, subgroup analyses revealed that aerobic exercise specifically was more effective
  at alleviating depressive symptoms compared to yoga or mixed exercise modalities.
