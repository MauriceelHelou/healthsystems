direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth who experience enjoyment and satisfaction from sport participation
  develop positive psychological associations with the activity'
- 'Step 2: These positive experiences enhance intrinsic motivation, commitment, and
  desire to continue participation'
- 'Step 3: Higher enjoyment and satisfaction act as protective factors that buffer
  against dropout triggers such as perceived lack of ability, competing demands, or
  negative social experiences'
- 'Step 4: Youth with sustained enjoyment and satisfaction maintain sport persistence,
  resulting in lower dropout rates'

description: This systematic review of 11 studies found that enjoyment and sports
  satisfaction are individual psychological factors that protect against youth sport
  dropout in late adolescence. Along with perception of ability and success, life
  satisfaction, goal orientation, motivation, and commitment, enjoyment and satisfaction
  emerged as key protective factors that promote sport persistence rather than dropout.
