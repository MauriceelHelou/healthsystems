category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individualized nutritional counseling based on Mediterranean/DASH diet
  principles is adapted to local food cultures and socioeconomic contexts, improving
  dietary adherence'
- 'Step 2: Dietary modifications increase consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole
  grains, legumes, and healthy fats while reducing saturated fats, refined carbohydrates,
  and sodium'
- 'Step 3: Increased fiber, polyphenols, and monounsaturated fatty acids reduce intestinal
  cholesterol absorption and improve lipid metabolism, lowering LDL-C and triglycerides'
- 'Step 4: Reduced sodium intake combined with increased potassium from plant foods
  and improved endothelial function from Mediterranean diet components decrease systolic
  and diastolic blood pressure'
- 'Step 5: Sustained dietary changes over 12 months produce significant reductions
  in cardiovascular risk markers (LDL-C, TGs, SBP, DBP) with effects maintained at
  15-month follow-up'

description: Individualized nutritional interventions based on Mediterranean/DASH
  dietary principles, when adapted to local food cultures and delivered through personalized
  counseling, significantly reduce cardiovascular risk markers including LDL cholesterol,
  triglycerides, and blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes over a 12-month
  period.
