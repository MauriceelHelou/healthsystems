direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to repeated hepatotoxic exposure as ethanol
  and its metabolite acetaldehyde directly damage hepatocytes'
- 'Step 2: Sustained alcohol-induced liver injury triggers inflammatory responses,
  oxidative stress, and hepatic stellate cell activation'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis develops from repeated cycles of liver damage and
  repair, eventually leading to cirrhosis and chronic liver disease'

description: Alcohol is the second most common cause of chronic liver disease in Ethiopia,
  accounting for an estimated 17% of CLD cases. Chronic alcohol consumption causes
  direct hepatotoxicity through ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolites, leading to progressive
  liver damage, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis. This meta-analysis of 12 observational
  studies demonstrates a significant contribution of alcohol to the CLD burden.
