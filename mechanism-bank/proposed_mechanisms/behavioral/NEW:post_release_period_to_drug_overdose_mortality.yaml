  node_id: drug_overdose_mortality
  node_name: Drug Overdose Mortality
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: During incarceration, individuals with opioid or other substance dependencies
  experience reduced or eliminated drug use, leading to decreased physiological tolerance
  to substances'
- 'Step 2: Upon release from prison, formerly incarcerated individuals often return
  to environments with drug availability and limited support systems, increasing likelihood
  of substance use resumption'
- 'Step 3: Return to pre-incarceration drug use quantities with significantly reduced
  tolerance results in dramatically elevated risk of fatal drug intoxication/overdose'

description: Persons recently released from prison have above average mortality, largely
  due to drug intoxication. This elevated risk stems from tolerance loss during incarceration
  combined with return to substance use at pre-incarceration levels. The review highlights
  deficiencies in substitution treatment provision both during incarceration and in
  outpatient care after release, which could mitigate this risk.
