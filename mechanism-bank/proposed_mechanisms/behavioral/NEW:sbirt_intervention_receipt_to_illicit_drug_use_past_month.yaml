direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency department patients are screened using validated instruments
  to identify risky alcohol and/or illicit drug use behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Trained bilingual/bicultural Health Educators deliver brief motivational
  interventions matched to patient risk level during a ''teachable moment'' when patients
  may be more receptive'
- 'Step 3: Motivational interviewing techniques enhance patient readiness for change
  and strengthen commitment to reduce substance use'
- 'Step 4: Patients with higher risk levels receive referral to treatment services
  for additional support'
- 'Step 5: Behavior change occurs post-intervention, resulting in reduced past-month
  illicit drug use at 6-month follow-up'

description: SBIRT services provided in emergency department settings are associated
  with modest reductions in self-reported past-month illicit drug use. The intervention
  capitalizes on the 'teachable moment' of an ED visit when patients may be more open
  to feedback about risky behaviors. Brief motivational interventions delivered by
  trained health educators, matched to patient risk level, facilitate behavior change.
  Effects were demonstrated using generalized linear mixed models with intention-to-treat
  analysis at 6-month follow-up.
