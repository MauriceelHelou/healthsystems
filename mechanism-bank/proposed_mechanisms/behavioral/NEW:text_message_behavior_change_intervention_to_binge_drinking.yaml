  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults with hazardous drinking receive automated text messages on
  their typical drinking days (2 days per week)'
- 'Step 2: Text messages deliver behavior change techniques including pre-drinking
  cognition feedback, alcohol consumption feedback, and/or adaptive goal support'
- 'Step 3: These techniques promote self-monitoring, increase awareness of drinking
  patterns, and support drinking limit goals'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced self-awareness and goal-directed behavior lead to reduced alcohol
  consumption on drinking occasions'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effect results in fewer binge drinking days per month'

description: Automated text message interventions incorporating behavior change techniques
  (feedback on drinking plans, alcohol consumption feedback, and drinking limit goal
  support) produce small yet durable reductions in binge drinking days among non-treatment
  seeking young adults with hazardous drinking. The combination intervention showed
  the strongest effects, with mean binge drinking days decreasing from 3.0 to 2.3
  at 3-month follow-up compared to an increase in the control condition.
