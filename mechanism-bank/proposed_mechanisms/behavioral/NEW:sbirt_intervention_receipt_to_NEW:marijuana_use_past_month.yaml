direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adult patients visiting emergency departments are universally screened
  for alcohol and drug use using standardized screening instruments by trained bilingual/bicultural
  Health Educators'
- 'Step 2: Patients who screen positive for marijuana use receive a brief motivational
  intervention matched to their risk level, delivered during a ''teachable moment''
  when they may be more receptive to feedback'
- 'Step 3: The motivational intervention increases awareness of risks associated with
  marijuana use and enhances motivation for behavior change'
- 'Step 4: Patients internalize intervention messages and implement changes in marijuana
  use behavior following discharge'
- 'Step 5: At 6-month follow-up, patients demonstrate modest reductions in past-month
  marijuana use prevalence and frequency'

description: SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) services
  delivered in emergency department settings are associated with modest reductions
  in past-month marijuana use. The intervention leverages the 'teachable moment' of
  an ED visit when patients may be more receptive to health behavior feedback. Trained
  Health Educators screen patients and deliver brief motivational interventions matched
  to risk level. Using an intention-to-treat approach with generalized linear mixed
  models, the California SBIRT program (CASBIRT) demonstrated modest but significant
  reductions in marijuana use outcomes at 6-month follow-up.
