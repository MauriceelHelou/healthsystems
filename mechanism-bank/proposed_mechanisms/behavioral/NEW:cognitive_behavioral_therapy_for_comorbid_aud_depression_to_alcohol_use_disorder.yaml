direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CBT teaches cognitive restructuring techniques to identify and challenge
  maladaptive thought patterns that trigger both depressive symptoms and alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Patients develop behavioral activation skills and alternative coping strategies
  to replace alcohol use as a mechanism for managing negative affect and depression'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced self-monitoring and problem-solving skills help patients recognize
  high-risk situations for drinking and implement relapse prevention strategies'
- 'Step 4: Addressing the bidirectional relationship between depression and alcohol
  use simultaneously reduces the reinforcing cycle where each condition exacerbates
  the other'

description: Cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with comorbid alcohol use disorder
  and depression produces a small but significant reduction in alcohol use. The network
  meta-analysis of 36 RCTs found that CBT adjunctive to treatment as usual demonstrated
  greater benefit than no additional treatment for reducing alcohol use (SMD = -0.25).
  The effect on alcohol use was smaller than the effect on depressive symptoms, suggesting
  CBT's impact on drinking may partially operate through improving depression.
