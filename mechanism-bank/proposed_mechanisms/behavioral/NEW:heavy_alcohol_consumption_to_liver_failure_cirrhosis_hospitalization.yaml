direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption (>110g/day) leads to repeated hepatotoxic
  insults as ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde damage hepatocytes'
- 'Step 2: Sustained hepatocellular injury triggers inflammatory responses, oxidative
  stress, and activation of hepatic stellate cells'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis develops as collagen deposition replaces functional
  liver tissue over years of heavy drinking'
- 'Step 4: Continued alcohol exposure leads to advanced fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis
  with loss of hepatic architecture and function'
- 'Step 5: Decompensated cirrhosis manifests as liver failure requiring hospitalization
  for complications (ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy)'

description: Heavy alcohol consumption (>110g/day) is strongly associated with alcoholic
  liver cirrhosis and subsequent hospitalization. A systematic review with meta-analysis
  of 38 studies (N=120,928) found that 45% of alcoholic liver cirrhosis patients consumed
  >110g alcohol/day, significantly higher than general population consumption levels.
  Alcohol-problem cohorts demonstrated high-risk status with cirrhosis incidence of
  7-16% over 8-12 years of follow-up.
