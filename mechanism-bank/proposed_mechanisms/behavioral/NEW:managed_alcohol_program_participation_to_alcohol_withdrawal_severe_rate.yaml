direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Managed Alcohol Programs (MAPs) provide regular, controlled doses of alcohol
  to individuals with severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) at scheduled intervals throughout
  the day'
- 'Step 2: Consistent alcohol administration prevents the dramatic fluctuations in
  blood alcohol levels that occur with chaotic drinking patterns common among homeless
  individuals with AUD'
- 'Step 3: Stabilized blood alcohol levels reduce the physiological shock of acute
  alcohol cessation that triggers severe withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 4: The structured environment and regular dosing minimizes periods of involuntary
  abstinence (due to lack of access, incarceration, or hospitalization) that can precipitate
  dangerous withdrawal episodes'
- 'Step 5: Reduced incidence of severe alcohol withdrawal including seizures, delirium
  tremens, and related medical emergencies requiring acute care'

description: Managed Alcohol Programs reduce severe alcohol withdrawal rates by providing
  controlled, regular doses of alcohol to individuals with severe alcohol use disorder,
  preventing the dangerous fluctuations in blood alcohol levels and unplanned abstinence
  episodes that trigger withdrawal crises. This scoping review synthesized findings
  from 32 studies across 38 established MAPs, demonstrating that the harm reduction
  approach of controlled alcohol administration is associated with reduced acute health
  emergencies related to alcohol withdrawal.
