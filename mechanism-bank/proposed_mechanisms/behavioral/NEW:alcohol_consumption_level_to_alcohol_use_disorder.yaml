direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular alcohol consumption at increasing levels leads to neuroadaptive
  changes in brain reward and stress systems'
- 'Step 2: These neurobiological adaptations result in tolerance development, requiring
  higher consumption to achieve desired effects'
- 'Step 3: Continued escalation of consumption establishes patterns of compulsive
  use and loss of control characteristic of alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: The dose-response relationship is exponential, with risk of AUD incidence
  increasing approximately sevenfold at 4 standard drinks per day compared to non-drinkers'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 studies (plus 2 primary data
  sources) demonstrates an exponential positive relationship between alcohol consumption
  levels and AUD incidence. At moderate consumption of 20g/day, AUD risk is nearly
  3-fold higher than non-drinkers, while at 40g/day the risk increases to 7-fold.
  This dose-response relationship reflects progressive neuroadaptation and behavioral
  conditioning that underlies the development of compulsive alcohol use patterns.
