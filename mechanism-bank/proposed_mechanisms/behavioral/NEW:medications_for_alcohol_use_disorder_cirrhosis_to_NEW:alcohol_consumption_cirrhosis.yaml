direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis and alcohol use disorder receive
  medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) including baclofen, metadoxine, acamprosate,
  or fecal microbiota transplant'
- 'Step 2: These medications act through various pharmacological mechanisms - baclofen
  acts as a GABA-B receptor agonist reducing alcohol craving and withdrawal symptoms;
  acamprosate modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission to reduce negative affective
  states associated with protracted abstinence'
- 'Step 3: The pharmacological effects reduce alcohol craving, withdrawal severity,
  and reward from alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced craving and withdrawal symptoms facilitate behavioral change, enabling
  patients to achieve and maintain alcohol abstinence'
- 'Step 5: MAUD treatment results in 32% increased alcohol abstinence compared to
  placebo or standard treatment, significantly reducing alcohol consumption in cirrhosis
  patients'

description: 'Medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) including baclofen, metadoxine,
  acamprosate, and fecal microbiota transplant are effective in reducing alcohol consumption
  among patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis. Meta-analysis of 4 RCTs showed
  MAUD reduces the relative risk of alcohol consumption by 32% (RR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.97)
  compared to placebo or standard treatment. These medications demonstrate a good
  safety profile, with only 3% of serious adverse events possibly or probably related
  to study medications.'
