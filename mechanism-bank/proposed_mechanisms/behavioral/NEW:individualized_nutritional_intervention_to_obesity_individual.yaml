direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individualized nutritional intervention provides personalized dietary planning
  inspired by Mediterranean/DASH diets, adapted to local food cultures and socioeconomic
  contexts'
- 'Step 2: Quarterly consultations with nutritional assessment reinforce dietary adherence
  and enable ongoing behavioral modification'
- 'Step 3: Improved eating habits lead to reduced caloric intake and improved macronutrient
  balance through emphasis on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and
  healthy fats'
- 'Step 4: Sustained dietary changes result in significant reductions in body weight,
  BMI, and waist circumference over 12 months'
- 'Step 5: Continued medical monitoring during follow-up helps maintain anthropometric
  improvements even after intensive nutritional intervention ends'

description: Individualized nutritional intervention based on Mediterranean/DASH dietary
  principles, adapted to local food cultures, significantly reduces obesity markers
  including weight, BMI, and waist circumference in adults with Type 2 Diabetes over
  a 12-month period. The intervention group showed significant reductions in all anthropometric
  parameters compared to baseline and compared to control group, while the control
  group experienced significant increases in weight, BMI, and waist-hip ratio. Benefits
  were largely sustained at 15-month follow-up.
