direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption (AUDIT-10 score 1-7 or AUDIT-C score 1-3)
  reflects low-risk drinking patterns that avoid harmful physiological effects of
  heavy alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: This consumption level may confer cardiovascular benefits through improved
  lipid profiles and reduced platelet aggregation compared to abstention, while avoiding
  toxic effects of higher consumption'
- 'Step 3: The apparent protective effect results in lower all-cause mortality risk
  compared to past-year abstainers, though this association varies by population and
  may be partially confounded by former drinkers among abstainers'

description: Moderate alcohol consumption (AUDIT-10 score 1-7) is associated with
  reduced all-cause mortality risk compared to abstention, with a 25% lower mortality
  risk observed in US Veterans populations. However, this association may be partially
  confounded by the inclusion of former drinkers (who may have stopped drinking due
  to health problems) in the abstainer reference group. The effect was not replicated
  in general population-based studies, suggesting limited generalizability.
