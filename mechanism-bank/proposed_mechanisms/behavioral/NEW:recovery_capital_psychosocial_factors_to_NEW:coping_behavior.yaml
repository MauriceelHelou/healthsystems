- 'Step 1: Inpatient SUD treatment interventions target and improve psychosocial factors
  that constitute recovery capital (mental health, social support, employment status)'
- 'Step 2: Improved mental health reduces psychological distress and enhances emotional
  regulation capacity'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced perceived social support provides external resources and reinforcement
  for adaptive behaviors'
- 'Step 4: These accumulated psychosocial resources (recovery capital) facilitate
  the development and maintenance of effective coping behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Improved coping behaviors support sustained abstinence and successful reintegration
  into society'

description: This systematic review synthesizes evidence showing that psychosocial
  factors connected to recovery capital (mental health, social support, employment
  status) improve after inpatient SUD treatment, and these improvements facilitate
  coping behavior. The review found overall progress in mental health, potential improvement
  in employment status and perceived social support, and decreased substance use from
  admission to follow-up. These psychosocial factors are conceptualized as recovery
  capital that supports coping behavior and reintegration to society.
