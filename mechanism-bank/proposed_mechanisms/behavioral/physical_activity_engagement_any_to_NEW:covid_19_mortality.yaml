direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular physical activity prior to COVID-19 infection enhances immune system
  function and reduces chronic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Improved cardiovascular and respiratory fitness provides greater physiological
  reserve to withstand acute infection'
- 'Step 3: Physical activity reduces prevalence of comorbidities (obesity, diabetes,
  cardiovascular disease) that increase COVID-19 mortality risk'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced immune response and reduced comorbidity burden leads to less severe
  disease progression and lower mortality rates'

description: Baseline physical activity prior to COVID-19 pandemic onset is significantly
  associated with reduced mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Physically active
  individuals showed 53% lower mortality risk compared to inactive individuals (RR=0.47).
  This protective effect extends to reduced hospitalizations (RR=0.58) and ICU admissions
  (RR=0.65). The benefits are attributable to improved immune function, enhanced cardiorespiratory
  fitness, and reduced comorbidity burden.
