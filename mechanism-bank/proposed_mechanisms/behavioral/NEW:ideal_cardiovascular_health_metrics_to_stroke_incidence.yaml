mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher adherence to AHA''s 7 ideal cardiovascular health metrics (smoking
  status, physical activity, diet, body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, and
  blood glucose) reflects healthier behavioral patterns and better metabolic control'
- 'Step 2: These combined health behaviors reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation,
  improve endothelial function, decrease systemic inflammation, and maintain healthy
  blood pressure levels'
- 'Step 3: Reduced atherosclerosis and improved vascular health decrease the likelihood
  of both ischemic stroke (from thrombosis or embolism) and hemorrhagic stroke (from
  hypertension-related vessel damage)'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative protective effect of multiple ideal CVH metrics results
  in significantly lower stroke incidence in the general population'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 prospective studies (n=3,240,660
  adults, mean follow-up 12.0 years) demonstrated that achieving a higher number of
  ideal cardiovascular health metrics as defined by the American Heart Association
  is significantly associated with reduced stroke incidence. The protective effect
  appears to be dose-dependent, with even modest improvements in CVH metrics providing
  meaningful stroke risk reduction. The 7 metrics encompass both behavioral factors
  (smoking, physical activity, diet) and health factors (BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol,
  blood glucose), which together influence stroke risk through multiple pathways including
  reduced atherosclerosis, improved vascular function, and better metabolic health.
