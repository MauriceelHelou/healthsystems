direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption associated with alcohol use disorder leads
  to repeated hepatotoxic insults to liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol metabolism generates acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species,
  causing oxidative stress and hepatocyte damage'
- 'Step 3: Sustained liver injury triggers inflammatory responses and activation of
  hepatic stellate cells'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrogenesis occurs with collagen deposition replacing functional
  liver parenchyma'
- 'Step 5: Continued exposure results in architectural distortion and nodular regeneration
  characteristic of cirrhosis'

description: Alcohol use disorder is the most common cause of cirrhosis in the United
  States, accounting for approximately 45% of all cirrhosis cases. Chronic alcohol
  consumption leads to progressive liver damage through direct hepatotoxicity, oxidative
  stress, and inflammatory cascades that ultimately result in fibrosis and cirrhotic
  transformation of the liver.
