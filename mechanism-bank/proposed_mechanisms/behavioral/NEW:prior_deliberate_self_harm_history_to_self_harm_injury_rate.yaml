direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior deliberate self-harm establishes behavioral patterns and coping mechanisms
  that involve self-injury as a response to psychological distress'
- 'Step 2: Previous episodes create learned behavioral pathways and reduce psychological
  barriers to self-harm, making future episodes more likely'
- 'Step 3: History of self-harm may be associated with underlying vulnerability factors
  (depression, substance use) that persist and continue to drive risk'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with prior self-harm history demonstrate nearly 4-fold increased
  odds of subsequent deliberate self-harm episodes'

description: Prior history of deliberate self-harm is the strongest categorical predictor
  of future deliberate self-harm, with individuals having a history demonstrating
  nearly 4-fold increased odds of subsequent episodes. This relationship was identified
  in a meta-analysis of first-episode psychosis patients, where 18.4% reported DSH
  prior to treatment and 11.4% committed DSH during follow-up periods of 1-7 years.
  The strong predictive value of prior DSH suggests behavioral reinforcement patterns
  and persistent underlying vulnerability factors.
