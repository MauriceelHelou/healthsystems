  node_name: Apparent Protective Effect of Low-Volume Drinking
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Former drinkers (who may have quit due to health problems) and occasional
  drinkers (<1.3g ethanol/day) are incorrectly classified as ''abstainers'' in epidemiological
  studies'
- 'Step 2: This misclassification creates a biased reference group where ''abstainers''
  include individuals with elevated mortality risk (former drinkers RR=1.22) mixed
  with true lifetime abstainers'
- 'Step 3: When low-volume drinkers are compared against this sick-quitter-contaminated
  reference group, they appear healthier by comparison, producing an artifactual J-shaped
  mortality curve'
- 'Step 4: Without adjustment, low-volume drinkers show apparent protective effect
  (RR=0.86), but after correcting for abstainer bias and study quality, this effect
  disappears (RR=0.97, non-significant)'

description: The apparent protective effect of low-volume alcohol consumption (J-shaped
  curve) is largely an artifact of misclassifying former drinkers and occasional drinkers
  as abstainers. Former drinkers, who often quit due to health problems ('sick quitters'),
  have elevated mortality risk. When they are incorrectly grouped with true lifetime
  abstainers, the reference category becomes biased toward ill health, making moderate
  drinkers appear relatively healthier. Meta-analysis of 87 studies (n=3,998,626)
  showed that after adjusting for abstainer biases and study quality characteristics,
  the apparent protective effect of low-volume drinking (unadjusted RR=0.86) disappeared
  entirely (adjusted RR=0.97, non-significant).

    their inclusion in the reference group inflates the apparent benefit of moderate
    drinking
