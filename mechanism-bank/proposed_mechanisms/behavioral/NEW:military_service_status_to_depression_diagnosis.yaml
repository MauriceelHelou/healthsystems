mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Military service exposes individuals to unique occupational stressors including
  combat exposure, deployment-related separation from family, and witnessing traumatic
  events'
- 'Step 2: These experiences create cumulative psychological burden through repeated
  stress activation, moral injury, and adaptation challenges'
- 'Step 3: Both active duty personnel and veterans face barriers to mental health
  care including stigma, limited access, and military culture emphasizing resilience'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress exposure and inadequate support lead to neurobiological
  changes and maladaptive coping patterns'
- 'Step 5: These factors culminate in elevated rates of clinical depression, with
  prevalence of 23% in active military and 20% in veterans'

description: Military service, whether active duty or veteran status, is associated
  with elevated depression prevalence compared to general population estimates. This
  systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies found depression
  prevalence of 23% among active military forces and 20% among veterans. The relationship
  is mediated by unique occupational exposures including combat, deployment stress,
  and trauma, combined with cultural and structural barriers to mental health care
  within military systems.
