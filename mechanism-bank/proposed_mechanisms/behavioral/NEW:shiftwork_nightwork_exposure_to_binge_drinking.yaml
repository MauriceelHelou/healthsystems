direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Shiftwork, especially night and rotating shifts, disrupts normal circadian
  rhythms and sleep-wake cycles'
- 'Step 2: Workers experience chronic sleep difficulties including problems initiating
  and maintaining sleep (affecting 20-40% of shiftworkers)'
- 'Step 3: Sleep deprivation and disruption lead to reduced capacity for work, social
  life impairment, and increased psychosocial stress'
- 'Step 4: Workers turn to alcohol as a self-medication strategy to cope with sleep
  problems and manage stress'
- 'Step 5: Regular alcohol use as a sleep aid develops into binge drinking patterns,
  further impairing sleep quality and creating a negative feedback cycle'

description: Shiftwork, especially night and rotating shifts, is associated with binge
  drinking disorder across different professions. The systematic review found that
  6 of 14 studies reported connections between shift/nightwork and alcohol consumption,
  particularly as a sleep aid. The primary mechanisms involve self-medication of sleep
  problems and coping with the stress and psychosocial challenges typical of shiftwork
  schedules.
