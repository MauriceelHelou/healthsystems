direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with a previous diagnosis of depression experience heightened
  psychological vulnerability during pandemic-related stressors'
- 'Step 2: COVID-19 pandemic stressors (job loss, social isolation, extended time
  at home) exacerbate depressive symptoms in those with depression history'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with depression diagnosis and current symptoms engage in increased
  alcohol consumption as a maladaptive coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: This self-medication behavior results in significantly higher odds of increased
  alcohol consumption compared to those without depression'

description: 'Individuals with a previous diagnosis of depression and current depression
  symptoms had significantly greater odds (AOR: 1.77) of increasing alcohol consumption
  during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those without depression. This relationship
  was observed among binge drinkers in a US adult sample during the early pandemic
  period (March-April 2020), suggesting depression serves as a risk factor for maladaptive
  alcohol-related coping behaviors during crisis periods.'
