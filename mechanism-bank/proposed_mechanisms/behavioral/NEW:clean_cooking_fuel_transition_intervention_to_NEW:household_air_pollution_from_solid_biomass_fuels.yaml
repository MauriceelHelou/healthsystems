  node_name: Household Air Pollution from Solid Biomass Fuels
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fuel transition interventions provide households with access to cleaner
  cooking fuels such as LPG, electricity, ethanol, or biogas as alternatives to solid
  biomass fuels (wood, charcoal, dung, crop residues)'
- 'Step 2: Households adopt clean cooking technologies and fuels, replacing or reducing
  traditional open fire or inefficient stove cooking practices'
- 'Step 3: Combustion of cleaner fuels produces substantially lower emissions of particulate
  matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, and other harmful pollutants compared to solid
  biomass fuel combustion'
- 'Step 4: Reduced pollutant emissions result in decreased concentrations of household
  air pollution, particularly in indoor cooking and living spaces where women and
  children spend significant time'

description: Clean cooking fuel transition interventions reduce household air pollution
  by replacing solid biomass fuel combustion (wood, charcoal, dung, crop residues)
  with cleaner alternatives such as LPG, electricity, or biogas. This systematic review
  protocol establishes the framework for evaluating such interventions in low- and
  middle-income countries, targeting pregnant women and children under 5 who are particularly
  vulnerable due to biological susceptibility and higher exposure levels during cooking
  activities.
