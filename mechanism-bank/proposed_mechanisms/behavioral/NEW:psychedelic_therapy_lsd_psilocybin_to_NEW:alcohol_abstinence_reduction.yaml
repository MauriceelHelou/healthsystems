direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Administration of psychedelic substances (LSD or psilocybin) in controlled
  therapeutic settings induces altered states of consciousness and neuroplasticity'
- 'Step 2: Psychedelic experience facilitates psychological insights, emotional processing,
  and disruption of maladaptive cognitive patterns associated with alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced self-awareness and mystical-type experiences promote motivation
  for behavioral change and reduced craving for alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Sustained neurobiological and psychological effects lead to increased odds
  of achieving abstinence or substantial reduction in alcohol consumption'

description: Meta-analysis of 6 trials demonstrates that psychedelic therapy (LSD
  or psilocybin) enhances the odds of achieving alcohol abstinence or substantial
  reduction in drinking by 89% compared to control conditions. When restricted to
  rigorous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (n=4), the odds ratio
  was 2.16. The mechanism involves psychedelic-induced neuroplasticity and psychological
  insights that facilitate behavioral change in patients with alcohol use disorder.
