to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Truck drivers experience unique occupational stressors including long hours,
  irregular schedules, social isolation, and extended time away from home and family
  support networks'
- 'Step 2: The nature of truck driving work creates limited access to healthy coping
  mechanisms, recreational activities, and social support systems that might otherwise
  buffer against stress'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol becomes an accessible coping mechanism for managing occupational
  stress, loneliness, and fatigue, with drinking often occurring during off-duty periods'
- 'Step 4: The pattern of extended periods of work followed by concentrated off-time
  may facilitate episodic heavy drinking (binge drinking) rather than moderate daily
  consumption'
- 'Step 5: This results in elevated binge drinking prevalence (19.0%) among truck
  drivers compared to general population rates'

description: 'Truck drivers demonstrate significantly elevated rates of binge drinking
  (19.0%, 95% CI: 13.1-26.9) compared to general population estimates. This systematic
  review and meta-analysis synthesized evidence showing that occupational factors
  unique to truck driving—including social isolation, irregular schedules, stress,
  and limited access to healthy coping resources—contribute to harmful alcohol consumption
  patterns. Additionally, alcohol misuse as measured by AUDIT/CAGE instruments was
  even higher at 22.7%.'
