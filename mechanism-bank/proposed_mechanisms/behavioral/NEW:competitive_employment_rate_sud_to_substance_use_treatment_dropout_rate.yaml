mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individual Placement and Support (IPS) programs integrate employment services
  directly with substance use treatment, creating a unified recovery framework'
- 'Step 2: Achieving competitive employment provides individuals with structure, purpose,
  financial stability, and social integration that reinforces recovery motivation'
- 'Step 3: Employment success creates a tangible stake in continued treatment adherence,
  as maintaining sobriety becomes essential for job retention'
- 'Step 4: The integration of employment services with treatment reduces barriers
  to engagement and creates accountability structures that decrease treatment dropout'
- 'Step 5: Higher employment rates among SUD populations are associated with improved
  treatment retention as individuals perceive greater value in completing treatment
  programs'

description: Competitive employment among persons with substance use disorder reduces
  treatment dropout through multiple reinforcing mechanisms. IPS programs that integrate
  rapid job placement with treatment services demonstrate high evidence for effectiveness.
  Employment provides structure, financial stability, and purpose that reinforces
  recovery motivation. The zero exclusion policy and integration of employment services
  with treatment creates accountability and reduces barriers to continued engagement.
  Key program components including rapid competitive job search and incorporation
  with treatment services strengthen the treatment-employment feedback loop, reducing
  dropout rates.
