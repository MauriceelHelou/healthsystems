direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased dietary intake of omega-6 linoleic acid (from sources like safflower
  oil and polyunsaturated margarine) replaces saturated fats in the diet'
- 'Step 2: High linoleic acid intake may promote oxidative modification of LDL cholesterol
  and increase oxidized lipid metabolites'
- 'Step 3: Omega-6 fatty acids may promote pro-inflammatory eicosanoid production
  (prostaglandins, leukotrienes) that contribute to atherosclerotic plaque instability'
- 'Step 4: These metabolic changes may accelerate cardiovascular disease progression
  and increase risk of fatal coronary events'

description: Substituting dietary saturated fats with omega-6 linoleic acid increased
  cardiovascular disease mortality in the Sydney Diet Heart Study RCT. The intervention
  group showed significantly higher cardiovascular mortality (17.2% vs 11.0%, HR 1.70).
  An updated meta-analysis of linoleic acid intervention trials showed a non-significant
  trend toward increased cardiovascular death risk (HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.98-1.65, P=0.07).
  These findings challenge the conventional advice to replace saturated fats with
  polyunsaturated fats for cardiovascular benefit.
