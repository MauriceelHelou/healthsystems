- 'Step 1: IPS program provides rapid competitive job search support with zero exclusion
  criteria, allowing persons with SUD to quickly engage in meaningful employment pursuit'
- 'Step 2: Employment integration with treatment services creates structured daily
  routines, purpose, and social connections that replace time previously associated
  with substance use behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Competitive employment provides financial stability, self-efficacy, and
  identity transformation that supports recovery motivation and reduces triggers for
  substance use'
- 'Step 4: Ongoing IPS support addresses barriers including housing instability and
  criminal justice involvement that are risk factors for relapse, maintaining recovery
  trajectory'

description: Individual Placement and Support (IPS) is an evidence-based vocational
  intervention originally designed for adults with mental illness that shows high
  evidence supporting its application for persons with SUD. Key components include
  zero exclusion criteria, rapid competitive job search, and integration with treatment
  services. Employment provides structure, purpose, financial stability, and social
  integration that support recovery from substance use disorders. The systematic review
  evaluated meta-analyses, reviews, and individual studies from 2000-2019, finding
  consistent support for IPS effectiveness with SUD populations.
