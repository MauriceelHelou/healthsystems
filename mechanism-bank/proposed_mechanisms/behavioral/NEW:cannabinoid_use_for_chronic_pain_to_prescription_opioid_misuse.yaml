direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with chronic pain initiate cannabinoid use (CBD or THC-containing
  products) as an alternative or adjunct pain management strategy'
- 'Step 2: Cannabinoids provide analgesic effects through THC and CBD mechanisms,
  with small improvements in pain severity observed particularly for neuropathic pain'
- 'Step 3: A subset of chronic pain patients successfully substitute cannabis products
  for prescription opioid medications'
- 'Step 4: Reduced reliance on prescription opioids decreases opportunities for opioid
  dose escalation, dependence development, and misuse behaviors'
- 'Step 5: The substitution effect results in lower rates of prescription opioid misuse
  among cannabinoid users compared to opioid-only treatment approaches'

description: Cannabis literature suggests that a subset of persons with chronic pain
  successfully substitute cannabis for pain medications, including opioids. The authors
  note that if a patient is able to substitute cannabis products for opioid medications,
  the risk-benefit calculation is relatively straightforward given the disproportionate
  all-cause mortality associated with opioid use. This substitution effect would logically
  reduce prescription opioid misuse by decreasing overall opioid exposure and dependence.
