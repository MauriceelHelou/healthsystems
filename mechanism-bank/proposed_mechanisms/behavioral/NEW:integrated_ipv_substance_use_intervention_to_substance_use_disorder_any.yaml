mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated interventions combine cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational
  interviewing approaches that simultaneously address substance use and intimate partner
  violence'
- 'Step 2: These therapeutic approaches help men recognize connections between their
  substance use patterns and violent behaviors, increasing awareness and motivation
  for change'
- 'Step 3: Participants develop coping skills and strategies to reduce substance use
  while also addressing relationship dynamics'
- 'Step 4: Short-term reductions in substance use outcomes observed (≤3 months) in
  individual trials compared to treatment as usual'

description: Integrated intimate partner violence and substance use interventions
  use cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing to address co-occurring
  substance use and violence among male IPV perpetrators. Individual trials showed
  short-term reductions in substance use outcomes (≤3 months), but meta-analysis of
  3 trials found no significant difference in substance use outcomes compared to treatment
  as usual. The evidence suggests limited effectiveness of current integrated approaches
  for reducing substance use in this population.
