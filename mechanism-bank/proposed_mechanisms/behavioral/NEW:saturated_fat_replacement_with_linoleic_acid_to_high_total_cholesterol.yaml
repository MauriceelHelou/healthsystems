  node_id: high_total_cholesterol
  node_name: Serum Cholesterol Level
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dietary saturated fat is replaced with linoleic acid-rich vegetable oils
  (e.g., corn oil, polyunsaturated margarine)'
- 'Step 2: Linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, upregulates LDL receptor expression
  in the liver, increasing clearance of LDL cholesterol from circulation'
- 'Step 3: Polyunsaturated fats also reduce hepatic VLDL production compared to saturated
  fats'
- 'Step 4: The combined effect results in significant reduction in serum total cholesterol
  levels (mean change -13.8% vs -1.0% in controls)'

description: Replacing dietary saturated fat with linoleic acid-rich vegetable oils
  effectively and significantly lowers serum cholesterol levels. The Minnesota Coronary
  Experiment demonstrated a 13.8% reduction in serum cholesterol in the intervention
  group compared to only 1.0% in controls (P<0.001). This finding was confirmed in
  a systematic review and meta-analysis of 5 additional randomized controlled trials
  (total n=10,808). The cholesterol-lowering effect is robust and reproducible across
  multiple trials, though notably, this reduction did not translate to reduced mortality
  from coronary heart disease or all causes.
