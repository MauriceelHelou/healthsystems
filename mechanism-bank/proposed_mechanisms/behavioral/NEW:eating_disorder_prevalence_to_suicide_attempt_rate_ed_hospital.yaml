direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and other EDs) involve
  severe psychological distress, emotional dysregulation, and impaired coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: These conditions frequently co-occur with depression, anxiety, sleep problems,
  and aggression, creating compounding psychological vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: The psychological distress and comorbid mental health conditions elevate
  non-suicidal self-injury (40% prevalence) and suicidal ideation (51% prevalence)'
- 'Step 4: Persistent suicidal ideation and self-harm behaviors increase the likelihood
  of progressing to suicide attempts (22% prevalence among those with eating disorders)'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 52 studies demonstrates that eating disorders
  are strongly associated with elevated suicide attempt rates, with 22% prevalence
  (95% CI: 18-25%) among individuals with eating disorders. The pathway operates through
  severe psychological distress, emotional dysregulation, and high rates of comorbid
  psychiatric conditions. Suicidal ideation (51% prevalence) and non-suicidal self-injury
  (40% prevalence) serve as intermediate steps in the progression toward suicide attempts.'
