  disturbance, and emotional dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: The psychological burden of eating disorders frequently co-occurs with
  depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and aggression, compounding mental health vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: These cumulative psychological stressors, combined with the chronic nature
  of eating disorders and their impact on quality of life, significantly increase
  the risk of suicidal ideation, with approximately 51% of individuals with eating
  disorders experiencing suicidal ideation'
