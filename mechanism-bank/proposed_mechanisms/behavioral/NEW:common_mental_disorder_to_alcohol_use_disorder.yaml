direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experience symptoms of common mental disorders including depression,
  anxiety, or phobia, characterized by negative affect, emotional distress, and psychological
  discomfort'
- 'Step 2: These individuals may engage in alcohol consumption as a form of self-medication
  or coping strategy to alleviate negative emotional states and manage distressing
  symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Repeated use of alcohol for symptom relief leads to tolerance, increased
  consumption patterns, and neurobiological adaptations that promote dependence'
- 'Step 4: The combination of underlying mental health vulnerability and maladaptive
  coping through alcohol use results in development of alcohol use disorder'

description: Individuals with common mental disorders (depression, anxiety, phobia)
  have a twofold increase in the odds of reporting an alcohol use disorder compared
  to those without CMDs. This meta-analysis of 17 studies with over 380,000 participants
  demonstrates a robust and consistent association across different types of common
  mental disorders, supporting a behavioral pathway where mental health symptoms may
  drive alcohol use as a coping mechanism.
