direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Partner engages in alcohol consumption leading to episodes of intoxication
  (occasional or frequent drunkenness)'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol intoxication impairs cognitive functioning, judgment, and impulse
  control, reducing inhibitions against aggressive behavior'
- 'Step 3: Intoxicated partner exhibits increased aggression, reduced empathy, and
  impaired conflict resolution abilities'
- 'Step 4: These behavioral changes during intoxication episodes increase the likelihood
  of physical violence perpetration against the intimate partner'
- 'Step 5: Higher frequency of partner intoxication episodes leads to greater cumulative
  exposure and elevated risk of experiencing intimate partner violence'

description: Women who report their intimate partners being intoxicated (drunk) have
  significantly elevated odds of experiencing physical intimate partner violence.
  This relationship demonstrates a clear dose-response pattern, with occasional partner
  drunkenness associated with 2.68 times higher odds of IPV, while frequent partner
  drunkenness is associated with nearly 6 times higher odds of experiencing physical
  IPV compared to women whose partners do not drink.

  description: 'Dose-response relationship observed: women with partners frequently
    drunk had substantially higher odds of IPV (aOR=5.94) compared to those with occasionally
    drunk partners (aOR=2.68), demonstrating that increased frequency of intoxication
    strongly amplifies IPV risk'
