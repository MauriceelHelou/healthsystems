direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Methamphetamine use causes acute dopamine release followed by dopaminergic
  neurotoxicity and depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters'
- 'Step 2: Chronic methamphetamine exposure leads to neuroadaptive changes in reward
  circuitry and stress response systems'
- 'Step 3: Neurotransmitter dysregulation and neurobiological changes manifest as
  depressive symptoms and increased risk of depression diagnosis'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies demonstrates that methamphetamine
  use is significantly associated with increased odds of depression. The longitudinal
  estimate (OR=1.18) provides stronger causal evidence than cross-sectional estimates.
  Those with methamphetamine use disorder show substantially elevated risk (OR=2.80).
  E-value analyses suggest low to moderate risk of unmeasured confounding in longitudinal
  results.
