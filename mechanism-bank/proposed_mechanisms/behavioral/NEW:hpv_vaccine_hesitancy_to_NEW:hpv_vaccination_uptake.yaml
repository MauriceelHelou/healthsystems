  node_id: NEW:hpv_vaccination_uptake
  node_name: HPV Vaccination Uptake
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parents and adolescents develop hesitancy toward HPV vaccination due to
  psychological/behavioral factors including perception of HPV risk versus vaccine
  risks and lack of trust in vaccines'
- 'Step 2: Vaccine hesitancy manifests as delayed decision-making, refusal to provide
  consent, or active avoidance of vaccination opportunities'
- 'Step 3: System-level barriers (challenges with obtaining consent) interact with
  hesitancy to further impede vaccination uptake'
- 'Step 4: Reduced willingness to vaccinate translates directly into lower HPV vaccination
  coverage rates, with UK coverage remaining below 80% and below pre-COVID levels'

description: HPV vaccine hesitancy, characterized by lack of trust in vaccines and
  concerns about vaccine risks relative to HPV disease risk, leads to delayed or refused
  vaccination among adolescents and parents. This systematic review of 24 UK studies
  found that despite general acceptance of HPV vaccination, coverage remains below
  target levels, with hesitancy identified as a key barrier alongside system-level
  challenges in obtaining consent.
