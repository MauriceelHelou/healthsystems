  node_id: NEW:hpv_vaccination_uptake
  node_name: HPV Vaccination Uptake
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parents and adolescents perceive risks associated with HPV vaccination
  (side effects, safety concerns) relative to risks of HPV infection and disease'
- 'Step 2: When perceived vaccine risks outweigh perceived HPV disease risks, psychological
  barriers to vaccination emerge'
- 'Step 3: These risk perception imbalances lead to vaccine hesitancy, delayed vaccination,
  or outright refusal'
- 'Step 4: Reduced intention to vaccinate translates to lower HPV vaccination uptake
  rates'

description: Perception of HPV vaccine risks relative to HPV disease risks acts as
  a psychological/behavioral barrier to vaccination. When individuals perceive vaccination
  risks (side effects, safety concerns) as outweighing the benefits of HPV protection,
  they are more likely to delay or refuse vaccination, resulting in lower HPV vaccination
  uptake. This systematic review of 24 UK studies identified risk perception as one
  of several key barriers impacting coverage rates that remain below pre-COVID levels.
