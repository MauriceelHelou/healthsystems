category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IPV survivors access technology-based digital interventions (apps, web
  platforms, telehealth) that provide safety planning, psychoeducation, and mental
  health support'
- 'Step 2: Digital interventions increase access to evidence-based resources and coping
  strategies while overcoming barriers to traditional in-person services (stigma,
  transportation, childcare, abuser surveillance)'
- 'Step 3: Survivors gain knowledge about IPV dynamics, develop safety behaviors,
  and access psychological support tools that reduce isolation and promote help-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Improved safety planning and coping mechanisms reduce ongoing trauma exposure
  and chronic stress associated with IPV'
- 'Step 5: Reduced trauma exposure and enhanced coping resources lead to decreased
  depressive symptomatology among IPV survivors in the short-term (0-3 months)'

description: Technology-based digital interventions for IPV survivors significantly
  reduce depression symptoms in the short-term (0-3 months) through improved access
  to safety planning, psychoeducation, and mental health resources. This meta-analysis
  of 17 RCTs with 4590 female IPV survivors found a small but significant effect (SMD
  = -0.08) on depression outcomes. Digital interventions overcome access barriers
  inherent in traditional services and can serve as an effective add-on to coordinated
  response strategies.
