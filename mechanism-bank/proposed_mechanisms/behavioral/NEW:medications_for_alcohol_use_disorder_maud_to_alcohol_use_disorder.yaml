direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MAUD (naltrexone or acamprosate) is prescribed to patients with diagnosed
  alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Naltrexone blocks opioid receptors, reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol
  and decreasing cravings; acamprosate modulates glutamate neurotransmission, reducing
  withdrawal symptoms and alcohol craving'
- 'Step 3: Reduced cravings and diminished rewarding effects lead to decreased alcohol
  consumption and improved ability to maintain abstinence'
- 'Step 4: Sustained reduction in alcohol use improves clinical outcomes including
  survival, particularly in patients with alcohol-associated complications such as
  cirrhosis'

description: Medications for Alcohol Use Disorder (MAUD), including naltrexone and
  acamprosate, are highly effective pharmacological interventions that reduce alcohol
  consumption and support abstinence in patients with AUD. These medications work
  through distinct neurobiological mechanisms to reduce cravings and the rewarding
  effects of alcohol. In a large retrospective cohort study of patients with alcohol-associated
  cirrhosis, MAUD exposure was associated with a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality
  compared to no MAUD exposure, demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of these
  medications in reducing harmful alcohol use behaviors.

  description: History of cirrhosis decompensation was the strongest negative predictor
    of MAUD prescription, suggesting reduced utilization in sicker patients

  description: Concurrent depression diagnosis was associated with higher likelihood
    of MAUD prescription, potentially indicating better engagement with mental health
