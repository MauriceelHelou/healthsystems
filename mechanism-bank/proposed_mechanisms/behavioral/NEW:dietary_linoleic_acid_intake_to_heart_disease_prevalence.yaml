direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dietary substitution of saturated fats with omega-6 linoleic acid (from
  sources like safflower oil and polyunsaturated margarine) increases tissue concentration
  of linoleic acid'
- 'Step 2: Increased linoleic acid may promote oxidation of LDL cholesterol and increase
  oxidative stress, potentially contributing to atherosclerotic plaque instability'
- 'Step 3: Pro-inflammatory metabolites derived from linoleic acid (eicosanoids) may
  enhance inflammatory processes in coronary arteries'
- 'Step 4: These combined effects may accelerate coronary heart disease progression
  and increase mortality risk in individuals with existing coronary disease'

description: Substituting dietary saturated fats with omega-6 linoleic acid (primarily
  from safflower oil) was associated with increased coronary heart disease mortality
  in a randomized controlled trial of men with prior coronary events. The Sydney Diet
  Heart Study showed a 74% increased risk of CHD death in the intervention group.
  An updated meta-analysis of linoleic acid intervention trials showed a non-significant
  trend toward increased CHD mortality (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.99-1.79, P=0.06), challenging
  the widely held assumption that polyunsaturated fat substitution for saturated fat
  reduces cardiovascular risk.
