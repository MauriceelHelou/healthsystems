mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experience mood disorders (depression) characterized by persistent
  negative affect, anhedonia, and emotional dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Affected individuals may engage in alcohol use as a coping mechanism (self-medication)
  to temporarily alleviate depressive symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Repeated alcohol use for mood regulation leads to neurobiological adaptations
  and increased tolerance, driving escalating consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Progressive alcohol dependence develops, meeting criteria for alcohol use
  disorder, with the association showing a twofold increase in odds'

description: Individuals with mood disorders (depression) have approximately twice
  the odds of reporting alcohol use disorder compared to those without mood disorders.
  This meta-analysis of 17 studies with over 382,000 participants demonstrates a robust
  association between depression and AUD in the general adult population. The relationship
  likely operates through self-medication pathways where individuals use alcohol to
  cope with depressive symptoms, leading to progressive dependence.
