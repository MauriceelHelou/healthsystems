category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by pervasive emotional
  dysregulation, fear of abandonment, and unstable interpersonal relationships'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with BPD experience intense emotional reactions to perceived
  threats in intimate relationships, including real or imagined abandonment'
- 'Step 3: Emotional dysregulation leads to difficulty managing anger and other intense
  emotions during interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 4: These dysregulated emotional states manifest as emotionally abusive behaviors
  toward intimate partners, including verbal attacks, manipulation, threats, and psychological
  control tactics'
- 'Step 5: The perpetration of emotional IPV serves maladaptive functions such as
  preventing abandonment, regaining control, or expressing overwhelming distress'

description: This meta-analysis of 181 studies found that Borderline Personality Disorder
  is significantly associated with emotional intimate partner violence perpetration.
  The association operates through the core features of BPD including emotional dysregulation,
  intense anger, and unstable interpersonal relationships. The study highlights that
  emotional dysregulation and anger are stronger correlates for perpetration than
  victimization, supporting the mechanistic pathway from BPD symptoms to abusive behaviors
  in intimate relationships.
