direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are engineered for hyperpalatability, leading
  to increased caloric intake beyond satiety signals'
- 'Step 2: UPFs are typically energy-dense but nutrient-poor, promoting chronic caloric
  excess without adequate micronutrient intake'
- 'Step 3: Chronic overconsumption of calories from UPFs leads to positive energy
  balance and fat accumulation'
- 'Step 4: Sustained positive energy balance results in weight gain and development
  of overweight/obesity'
- 'Step 5: Obesity contributes to metabolic dysfunction including insulin resistance,
  metabolic syndrome, and related conditions such as NAFLD and type 2 diabetes'

description: Ultra-processed food consumption is associated with obesity through mechanisms
  involving chronic caloric excess and physical inactivity. This meta-analysis of
  9 studies (60,961 individuals) confirms that UPF intake increases risk of metabolic
  conditions associated with obesity, with a clear dose-response relationship. High
  UPF consumption significantly increases risk compared to low consumption, supporting
  previous meta-analyses confirming associations between UPF intake and obesity.
