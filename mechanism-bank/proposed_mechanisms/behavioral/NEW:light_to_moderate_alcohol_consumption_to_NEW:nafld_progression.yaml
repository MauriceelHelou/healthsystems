direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption (typically defined as up to 1-2 drinks/day)
  may improve insulin sensitivity compared to abstinence'
- 'Step 2: Moderate alcohol intake may reduce hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress
  through antioxidant properties of certain alcoholic beverages (e.g., polyphenols
  in wine)'
- 'Step 3: Improved metabolic parameters may slow or prevent progression from simple
  steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Reduced inflammatory cascade activity decreases hepatic stellate cell activation
  and subsequent fibrogenesis'

description: This meta-analysis examines the relationship between light-to-moderate
  alcohol consumption and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
  The negative direction suggests that moderate alcohol intake may be associated with
  reduced risk of NAFLD progression compared to abstinence, potentially through mechanisms
  involving improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation, and metabolic benefits.
  However, this finding remains controversial given the known hepatotoxic effects
  of alcohol at higher doses.
