direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with liver disease receive dedicated AUD intervention (either
  integrated colocated liver and addiction clinics or concomitant separate hepatology
  and addiction clinics)'
- 'Step 2: AUD intervention provides structured support including behavioral counseling,
  pharmacotherapy, and monitoring that addresses the addiction component of alcohol-related
  liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing addiction-focused care increases patient engagement with recovery
  programs and provides accountability mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Combined medical and addiction support results in increased rates of alcohol
  abstinence (0.41 abstinence rate per person-year with intervention)'

description: AUD intervention in patients with liver disease leads to improved alcohol
  abstinence rates. Meta-analysis of 20 studies with 38,329 patients (7,072 receiving
  AUD intervention) found abstinence rates of 0.41 per person-year with AUD intervention.
  The odds ratio for abstinence with AUD intervention versus standard of care was
  1.24, while relapse odds were reduced to 0.52. For liver transplant recipients specifically,
  integrated addiction team follow-up reduced relapse odds to 0.48.
