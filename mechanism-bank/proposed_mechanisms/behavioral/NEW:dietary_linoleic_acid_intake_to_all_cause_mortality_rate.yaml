  node_id: all_cause_mortality_rate
  node_name: All-Cause Mortality
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased dietary intake of omega-6 linoleic acid (primarily from safflower
  oil and polyunsaturated margarines) replaces saturated fat in the diet'
- 'Step 2: Elevated linoleic acid intake may increase oxidized LDL particles and promote
  inflammatory processes through conversion to arachidonic acid and pro-inflammatory
  eicosanoids'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to atherosclerotic
  plaque instability and cardiovascular events'
- 'Step 4: Increased cardiovascular mortality and coronary heart disease mortality
  translate to elevated all-cause mortality'

description: Substituting dietary linoleic acid (omega-6 polyunsaturated fat) for
  saturated fats was associated with increased all-cause mortality in a randomized
  controlled trial of men with prior coronary events. The intervention group receiving
  safflower oil and polyunsaturated margarine had 62% higher all-cause mortality compared
  to controls. An updated meta-analysis of linoleic acid intervention trials showed
  non-significant trends toward increased cardiovascular and coronary heart disease
  mortality.
