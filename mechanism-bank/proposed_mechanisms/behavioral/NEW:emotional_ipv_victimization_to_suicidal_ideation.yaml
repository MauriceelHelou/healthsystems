- 'Step 1: Emotional intimate partner violence victimization exposes individuals to
  chronic psychological abuse including verbal attacks, humiliation, control, and
  emotional manipulation within intimate relationships'
- 'Step 2: This chronic emotional abuse leads to multiple psychological consequences
  including post-traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress,
  and shame - all of which were found to be significantly associated with emotional
  IPV victimization'
- 'Step 3: The accumulation of these mental health impacts, combined with feelings
  of hopelessness, entrapment, and diminished self-worth associated with ongoing emotional
  abuse, increases vulnerability to suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Suicidal ideation emerges as a significant correlate of emotional IPV victimization,
  with the relationship being particularly strong for women compared to men'

description: Meta-analytic evidence from 181 studies demonstrates that emotional intimate
  partner violence victimization is significantly associated with suicidal ideation.
  This relationship operates through multiple psychosocial pathways including the
  development of post-traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological
  distress, and shame resulting from chronic emotional abuse. The association is particularly
  strong for women compared to men. Emotional IPV affects approximately 50% of both
  men and women during their lifetime, making this pathway a significant public health
  concern.
