direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients who demonstrate good compliance with medical care pre-transplant
  establish patterns of following treatment protocols and attending appointments'
- 'Step 2: This behavioral pattern indicates capacity for self-regulation, health-focused
  decision making, and engagement with healthcare systems'
- 'Step 3: Post-transplant, these established compliance behaviors transfer to adherence
  with immunosuppression regimens and abstinence recommendations'
- 'Step 4: Continued engagement with medical care provides ongoing monitoring, support,
  and accountability that reinforces abstinence from alcohol'

description: A systematic review of 22 studies on psychosocial selection criteria
  for liver transplant candidates with alcoholic liver disease found that good compliance
  with medical care has been associated with future abstinence in more studies than
  not. This suggests that pre-transplant medical care compliance behavior serves as
  a marker for post-transplant behavioral adherence including abstinence from alcohol.
