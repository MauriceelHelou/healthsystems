direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders and pandemic restrictions increase time
  spent at home'
- 'Step 2: Extended home confinement introduces and exacerbates stressors including
  job loss, social isolation, and poor mental health'
- 'Step 3: Increased stress exposure combined with reduced access to normal coping
  mechanisms and social support leads to maladaptive coping behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Greater accessibility to alcohol at home and reduced social monitoring
  increases opportunity for excessive drinking'
- 'Step 5: These combined factors result in increased odds of binge drinking behavior,
  with each additional week at home further elevating risk'

description: For every 1-week increase in time spent at home during the COVID-19 pandemic,
  there was 1.19 times greater odds of binge drinking after adjusting for sociodemographics.
  The study found that 34% of participants reported binge drinking during the pandemic,
  and binge drinkers were more likely to have increased their alcohol consumption
  (60%) compared to non-binge drinkers (28%). This association reflects the unintended
  health consequences of pandemic-related social restrictions.
