- 'Step 1: Emotional IPV victimization exposes individuals to repeated psychological
  abuse, threats, coercion, and controlling behaviors from an intimate partner'
- 'Step 2: These experiences create chronic fear, hypervigilance, and feelings of
  helplessness that constitute traumatic stressors within the bio-psycho-social framework'
- 'Step 3: The traumatic nature of emotional abuse leads to the development of post-traumatic
  stress symptoms including intrusive thoughts, avoidance, negative cognitions, and
  hyperarousal'
- 'Step 4: PTSD emerges as a stronger correlate for victimization compared to perpetration,
  indicating the particular vulnerability of victims to trauma-related outcomes'

description: Meta-analytic evidence from 181 studies demonstrates that emotional intimate
  partner violence victimization is significantly associated with post-traumatic stress.
  PTSD was identified as a stronger correlate for emotional IPV victimization compared
  to perpetration, highlighting the traumatic impact of being a victim. Women showed
  stronger associations between victimization and PTSD than men. The bio-psycho-social
  framework explains this relationship through the chronic psychological harm inflicted
  by emotional abuse, which creates conditions conducive to trauma-related mental
  health outcomes.
