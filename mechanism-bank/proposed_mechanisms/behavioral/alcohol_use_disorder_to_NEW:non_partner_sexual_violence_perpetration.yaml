direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Harmful alcohol use impairs cognitive functioning, including executive
  functions responsible for impulse control, risk assessment, and moral reasoning'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol intoxication reduces inhibitions and increases disinhibition, making
  individuals more likely to act on aggressive or sexual impulses they would otherwise
  suppress'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol myopia narrows attention to immediate cues and desires while reducing
  consideration of long-term consequences and social norms against sexual violence'
- 'Step 4: Harmful drinking patterns create contexts (social settings, impaired victims)
  that facilitate opportunities for sexual violence perpetration against non-partners'
- 'Step 5: Increased frequency and severity of alcohol use corresponds with dose-response
  increases in non-partner sexual violence perpetration'

description: Harmful alcohol use is significantly associated with increased perpetration
  of non-partner sexual violence among men. A pooled analysis across four violence
  prevention studies in sub-Saharan Africa found that men with harmful alcohol use
  had 2.64 times higher odds of perpetrating NPSV compared to non-drinkers. The relationship
  shows a dose-response pattern where frequency of perpetration increases with increasing
  levels of alcohol use. This association operates through alcohol's pharmacological
  effects on disinhibition, impaired judgment, and reduced consideration of consequences.
