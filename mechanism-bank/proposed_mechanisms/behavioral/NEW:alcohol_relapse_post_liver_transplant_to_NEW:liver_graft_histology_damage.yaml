direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients who received liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis resume
  alcohol consumption (relapse), with annual relapse rates of approximately 4.7% for
  any alcohol use and 2.9% for heavy alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Resumed alcohol consumption subjects the transplanted liver graft to direct
  hepatotoxic effects, including oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and metabolic
  disruption'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to progressive histological damage in the
  graft, manifesting as steatosis (fatty liver), steatohepatitis (inflammation with
  fat), and alcoholic hepatitis'
- 'Step 4: Continued alcohol-induced injury triggers fibrogenesis in the graft, leading
  to advanced fibrosis and ultimately recurrent cirrhosis of the transplanted liver'
- 'Step 5: Recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis develops in approximately 9% of biopsied
  patients, accounting for about 20% of all deaths during follow-up after liver transplantation'

description: Meta-analysis of 7 studies demonstrates that alcohol relapse after liver
  transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis significantly increases the risk of graft
  histological damage. Relapsers compared to abstainers had substantially higher odds
  of developing graft steatosis (OR 4.1), steatohepatitis (OR 4.5), alcoholic hepatitis
  (OR 9.3), and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (OR 8.4). Recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis
  occurred in 9% of biopsied patients and was responsible for approximately 20% of
  all deaths during follow-up.

  description: Heavy alcohol use (2.9% annual rate) likely produces more severe histological
    damage than occasional/light use (4.7% total relapse rate), though both contribute
    to graft injury
- name: Duration of follow-up
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Longer follow-up periods (median 6 years, range 3.7-8.3 years) reveal
    more cumulative histological damage from sustained alcohol exposure
