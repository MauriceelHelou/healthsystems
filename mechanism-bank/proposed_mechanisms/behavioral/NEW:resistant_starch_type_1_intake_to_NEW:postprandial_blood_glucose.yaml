direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Resistant starch type 1 (RS1) is consumed through foods containing starch
  protected by intact plant cell walls (e.g., whole grains, legumes, seeds)'
- 'Step 2: The intact plant cell structures physically prevent digestive enzymes from
  accessing the starch in the small intestine'
- 'Step 3: Reduced enzymatic digestion of starch leads to slower and diminished glucose
  release into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 4: The reduced rate of glucose absorption results in attenuated postprandial
  blood glucose excursions'
- 'Step 5: Both acute single-meal and chronic repeated consumption demonstrate sustained
  improvements in postprandial glycemic response'

description: 'Resistant starch type 1, characterized by starch protected within intact
  plant cell walls, significantly reduces postprandial blood glucose in individuals
  with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. This systematic review and meta-analysis of
  36 RCTs demonstrated that RS1 lowers acute postprandial blood glucose (SMD -0.54,
  95% CI: -1.0 to -0.07) and chronic postprandial glucose (SMD -0.38, 95% CI: -0.73
  to -0.02). The mechanism operates through physical protection of starch from digestive
  enzymes, reducing glucose absorption rate.'
