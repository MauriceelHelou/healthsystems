direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with repeated alcohol treatment failures demonstrate a pattern
  of inability to achieve or maintain abstinence despite therapeutic interventions'
- 'Step 2: This pattern reflects underlying factors such as severe alcohol dependence,
  inadequate coping mechanisms, limited social support, or co-occurring psychological
  conditions that impair recovery'
- 'Step 3: These same underlying factors persist post-transplant, reducing the likelihood
  of sustained abstinence despite the life-saving nature of the transplant'
- 'Step 4: The behavioral patterns established through repeated treatment failures
  predict continued difficulty maintaining abstinence after liver transplantation'

description: A systematic review of 22 studies examining psychosocial selection criteria
  for liver transplant candidates with alcoholic liver disease found that a history
  of repeated alcohol treatment failures was associated with reduced likelihood of
  post-transplant abstinence. This finding was consistent across more studies than
  not among those examining this variable. The pattern of prior treatment failures
  serves as a behavioral marker for factors that impair long-term recovery from alcohol
  dependence.
