mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular practice of Baduanjin, a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise
  involving slow, gentle movements coordinated with breathing and meditation'
- 'Step 2: Integration of physical movement with mindfulness and breath regulation
  activates parasympathetic nervous system and reduces stress hormones'
- 'Step 3: Improved glycemic control (reduced FBG, HbA1c, 2-hPBG) in diabetic patients
  reduces physiological stress burden and inflammation associated with poor metabolic
  regulation'
- 'Step 4: Mind-body integration promotes relaxation response, emotional regulation,
  and enhanced psychological well-being'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in depressive symptoms through combined physical, psychological,
  and social benefits of structured exercise practice'

description: Baduanjin exercise, a traditional Chinese mind-body practice, significantly
  reduces depression symptoms in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. This systematic
  review and meta-analysis of 27 RCTs found a large positive effect (SMD=1.03) on
  depression reduction. The mechanism involves the integration of slow physical movements
  with breath control and meditation, which promotes relaxation, improves glycemic
  control, and enhances overall psychological well-being.
