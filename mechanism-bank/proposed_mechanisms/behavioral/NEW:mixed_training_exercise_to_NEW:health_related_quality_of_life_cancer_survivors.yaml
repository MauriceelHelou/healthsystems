direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cancer survivors engage in mixed training exercise combining aerobic and
  resistance components, typically at an optimal dose of approximately 970 METs-min/week'
- 'Step 2: Combined exercise modalities produce synergistic physiological adaptations
  including improved cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength and endurance, reduced
  fatigue, and enhanced functional capacity'
- 'Step 3: These physical improvements translate to enhanced ability to perform daily
  activities, reduced cancer-related symptoms, improved body composition, and better
  psychological well-being'
- 'Step 4: The comprehensive physical and psychological benefits result in significant
  improvements in health-related quality of life across multiple domains (physical,
  emotional, social, functional)'

description: 'Mixed training exercise combining aerobic and resistance components
  demonstrates the strongest positive effect on health-related quality of life in
  cancer survivors among all exercise modalities. A Bayesian network meta-analysis
  of 48 RCTs with 3050 participants found that mixed training at an optimal dose of
  970 METs-min/week produced a large effect (SMD: 0.883), surpassing aerobic exercise,
  resistance training, and mind-body exercises alone. The dose-response relationship
  shows optimal benefits at moderate doses with diminishing returns at higher intensities.'
