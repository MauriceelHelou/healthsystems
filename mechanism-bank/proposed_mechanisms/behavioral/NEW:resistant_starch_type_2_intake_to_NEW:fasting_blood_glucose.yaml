direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Resistant starch type 2 (high amylose content) resists digestion by endogenous
  enzymes in the small intestine due to its molecular structure'
- 'Step 2: Undigested RS2 reaches the large intestine where it undergoes fermentation
  by gut microbiota, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)'
- 'Step 3: SCFAs improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in peripheral tissues
  through multiple signaling pathways'
- 'Step 4: Improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism leads to reduced fasting
  blood glucose levels over chronic consumption periods'

description: Chronic intake of resistant starch type 2 significantly reduces fasting
  blood glucose levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. This meta-analysis
  of 36 RCTs found a moderate effect size (SMD = -0.39) for the relationship between
  RS2 intake and improved fasting glucose. RS2, characterized by high amylose content
  that resists small intestinal digestion, reaches the colon where fermentation produces
  metabolites that improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.
