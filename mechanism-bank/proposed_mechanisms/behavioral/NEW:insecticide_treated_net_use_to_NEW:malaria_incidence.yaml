direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals sleep under insecticide-treated nets during nighttime hours
  when Anopheles mosquitoes are most active'
- 'Step 2: The physical barrier of the net prevents mosquito bites, reducing human-vector
  contact'
- 'Step 3: The insecticide coating kills or repels mosquitoes that land on the net,
  providing additional protection'
- 'Step 4: Reduced mosquito bites decrease transmission of Plasmodium parasites from
  infected mosquitoes to humans'
- 'Step 5: Lower parasite transmission results in decreased incidence of both Plasmodium
  falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria infections'

description: Insecticide-treated nets significantly reduce malaria incidence by providing
  both a physical barrier and chemical protection against mosquito bites. This systematic
  review and meta-analysis of 22 studies with over 616,000 participants found high-certainty
  evidence that ITN use reduces P. falciparum incidence by 45% and P. vivax incidence
  by 31% in humanitarian emergency settings.
