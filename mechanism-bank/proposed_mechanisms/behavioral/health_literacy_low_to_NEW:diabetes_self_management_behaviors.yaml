direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low health literacy limits individuals'' ability to comprehend health information,
  including diabetes education materials, medication instructions, and dietary guidelines'
- 'Step 2: Reduced comprehension impairs acquisition of diabetes knowledge and understanding
  of self-care activities such as glucose monitoring, medication adherence, diet management,
  and physical activity'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate understanding, patients struggle to perform essential
  self-management behaviors consistently, leading to poorer diabetes self-care and
  suboptimal glycemic control'

description: Low health literacy negatively impacts diabetes self-management behaviors
  by limiting patients' ability to understand and apply essential diabetes care information.
  This systematic review of 15 RCTs demonstrated that health literacy-driven interventions
  significantly improved both glycemic control (HbA1c) and self-management outcomes,
  confirming that health literacy is a primary driver of self-management activities.
  The inverse relationship indicates that individuals with low health literacy have
  diminished capacity to engage in effective self-care behaviors.
