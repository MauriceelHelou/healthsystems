mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Injecting drug use involves sharing of needles and drug preparation equipment,
  creating direct blood-to-blood contact between users'
- 'Step 2: Blood-borne hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission occurs through contaminated
  injection equipment, with HCV seroprevalence reaching 20% (95% CI 12%-30%) among
  people who are homeless with injection drug use'
- 'Step 3: Chronic HCV infection leads to progressive liver inflammation and hepatic
  fibrosis, with F4 fibrosis (cirrhosis) prevalence of 7-16% in this population'
- 'Step 4: Advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis result in liver decompensation requiring
  hospitalization for complications including liver failure'

description: Injecting drug use increases liver disease hospitalization primarily
  through hepatitis C virus transmission via contaminated injection equipment. In
  populations with high injecting drug use prevalence, HCV seroprevalence reaches
  20%, leading to progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis (F4 fibrosis prevalence
  7-16%). The pathway is exacerbated by concurrent alcohol use and barriers to HCV
  treatment access, particularly among marginalized populations.
