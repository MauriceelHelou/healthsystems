mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adherence to ideal cardiovascular health metrics (smoking status, physical
  activity, diet, body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose)
  establishes favorable behavioral and biological cardiovascular profiles'
- 'Step 2: These metrics act synergistically to reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation,
  decrease systemic inflammation, improve endothelial function, and maintain optimal
  hemodynamic and metabolic states'
- 'Step 3: Reduced atherosclerotic burden and improved cardiovascular function lower
  the incidence of acute cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and
  stroke'
- 'Step 4: Lower incidence and severity of cardiovascular events translates to decreased
  cardiovascular disease mortality risk'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 prospective studies involving
  over 3.2 million adults demonstrates that achieving a higher number of ideal cardiovascular
  health metrics as defined by the American Heart Association is significantly associated
  with reduced cardiovascular disease mortality. The AHA's 7-metric tool encompasses
  both behavioral factors (smoking, physical activity, diet) and biological factors
  (BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose), which together create a comprehensive
  cardiovascular risk profile. The protective effect was statistically significant
  (p < 0.05) with a mean follow-up of 12 years, indicating that even modest improvements
  in cardiovascular health metrics confer mortality benefits.
