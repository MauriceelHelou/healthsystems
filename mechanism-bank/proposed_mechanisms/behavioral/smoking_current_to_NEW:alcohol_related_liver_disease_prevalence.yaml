  node_name: Alcohol Related Liver Disease Prevalence
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smoking frequently co-occurs with heavy alcohol consumption as part of
  a clustered risk behavior pattern, leading to combined exposure in the ARLD population'
- 'Step 2: Smoking induces oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver, which compounds
  the hepatotoxic effects of alcohol metabolism'
- 'Step 3: The synergistic effects of smoking and alcohol consumption accelerate liver
  damage progression, fibrosis, and cirrhosis development'
- 'Step 4: Approximately 59.5% of ARLD patients are current or former smokers, indicating
  a strong behavioral association and potential causal pathway contributing to ARLD
  prevalence'

description: Current smoking is strongly associated with alcohol-related liver disease
  prevalence, with 59.5% of ARLD patients being current or former smokers. This association
  operates through behavioral clustering of risk factors (smoking and heavy drinking
  commonly co-occur), as well as biological synergy where smoking-induced oxidative
  stress compounds alcohol-mediated hepatotoxicity, accelerating progression to cirrhosis
  and other severe liver outcomes.

  description: ARLD prevalence in males (2.9%) is substantially higher than females
    (0.5%), and smoking rates tend to be higher in males, potentially amplifying the
    association
- name: drinking_duration
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: 54.8% of ARLD population had been drinking for >20 years; longer duration
    of combined smoking and drinking exposure increases liver disease risk
- name: hepatitis_virus_coinfection
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: 18.7% of ARLD patients had hepatitis virus coinfection, which combined
    with smoking further accelerates liver damage
