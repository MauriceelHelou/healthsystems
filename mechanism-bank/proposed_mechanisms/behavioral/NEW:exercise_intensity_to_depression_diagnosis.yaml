direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher intensity exercise prescriptions lead to greater physiological adaptations
  including increased neurotransmitter release (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine)
  and enhanced neuroplasticity'
- 'Step 2: Intense exercise promotes greater BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor)
  expression and neurogenesis in brain regions implicated in depression (e.g., hippocampus)'
- 'Step 3: More intense exercise produces stronger anti-inflammatory effects and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis regulation, reducing chronic stress responses'
- 'Step 4: Higher intensity activity generates greater improvements in self-efficacy,
  mastery, and distraction from negative rumination'
- 'Step 5: These dose-dependent neurobiological and psychological changes result in
  proportionally greater reductions in depressive symptoms with increasing exercise
  intensity'

description: A comprehensive network meta-analysis of 218 randomized controlled trials
  (14,170 participants) demonstrated that the antidepressant effects of exercise are
  proportional to the intensity prescribed. Higher intensity exercise produces greater
  reductions in depression symptoms compared to lower intensity exercise. Walking/jogging,
  yoga, and strength training showed the strongest effects, particularly when performed
  at intense levels. The relationship was consistent across populations regardless
  of comorbidities or baseline depression severity.
