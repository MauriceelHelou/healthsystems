direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular physical activity engagement prior to COVID-19 infection improves
  baseline cardiovascular and respiratory fitness'
- 'Step 2: Physical activity enhances immune function through improved circulation,
  reduced chronic inflammation, and better immune cell activity'
- 'Step 3: Exercise reduces comorbidity risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension)
  that are associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Improved physiological resilience allows the body to better tolerate and
  respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 5: Reduced severity of COVID-19 symptoms and disease progression decreases
  likelihood of requiring hospitalization'

description: A meta-analysis of 12 studies involving over 1.25 million COVID-19 patients
  found that physically active individuals had a 42% lower risk of hospitalization
  compared to inactive individuals. The protective effect was even stronger for those
  engaging in resistance exercise, who showed a 73% reduction in hospitalization risk.
  Physical activity prior to infection appears to provide substantial protection against
  severe COVID-19 outcomes requiring hospitalization.
