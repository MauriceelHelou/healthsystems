direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early initiation of alcohol drinking during adolescence (before age 15-17)
  establishes patterns of substance use during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Earlier onset of drinking is associated with increased risk of developing
  heavier drinking patterns and alcohol-related problems over time'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated alcohol consumption leads to negative health consequences including
  accidents, injuries, and physiological damage'
- 'Step 4: These cumulative health impacts manifest as poorer self-reported health
  status and reduced overall functioning'

description: This research programme found associations between earlier onset of drinking
  and poorer health and social functioning among adolescents aged 10-17 years attending
  emergency departments. The prevalence study (n=5376) demonstrated that early alcohol
  initiation was linked to adverse health outcomes. While the study focused primarily
  on intervention effectiveness for reducing alcohol consumption, the prevalence component
  established the relationship between early drinking onset and self-reported health
  status.
