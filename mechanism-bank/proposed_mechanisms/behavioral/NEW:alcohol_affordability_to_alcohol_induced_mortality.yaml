  node_id: alcohol_induced_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Induced Mortality
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol affordability (lower relative prices) enables increased
  alcohol purchasing and consumption, particularly among price-sensitive populations
  with lower socioeconomic status'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol consumption leads to higher rates of acute harm (injuries)
  and chronic conditions (infectious diseases, alcohol-induced diseases)'
- 'Step 3: These alcohol-related harms translate into elevated mortality rates, with
  stronger effects observed among lower educated/lower income populations who are
  more responsive to price changes'
- 'Step 4: The inverse is also demonstrated - when affordability decreases (through
  taxation), mortality declines, confirming the positive relationship between affordability
  and alcohol-induced mortality'

description: Higher alcohol affordability is associated with increased alcohol-induced
  mortality through increased consumption. Evidence from Lithuania's 2017 taxation
  increase (which reduced affordability) demonstrated a 13% temporary reduction in
  mortality inequalities among men, primarily through reductions in injury-related
  and infectious disease deaths. This natural experiment confirms that when alcohol
  becomes more affordable, consumption and related mortality increase, particularly
  among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.
