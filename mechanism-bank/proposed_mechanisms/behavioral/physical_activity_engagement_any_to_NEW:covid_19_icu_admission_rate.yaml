  node_name: COVID-19 ICU Admission Rate
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular physical activity prior to COVID-19 infection enhances baseline
  immune function and reduces chronic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Improved cardiorespiratory fitness from exercise increases physiological
  reserve and oxygen utilization capacity'
- 'Step 3: Physical activity reduces comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular disease,
  diabetes) that are risk factors for severe COVID-19'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced immune regulation and reduced systemic inflammation attenuate
  the severity of COVID-19 infection'
- 'Step 5: Lower disease severity translates to reduced need for intensive care unit
  admission among physically active individuals'

description: A meta-analysis of 12 studies involving over 1.25 million COVID-19 patients
  found that physically active individuals had a 35% lower risk of ICU admission compared
  to inactive individuals. This protective effect is likely mediated through improved
  immune function, enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness, reduced chronic inflammation,
  and lower prevalence of comorbidities among physically active people.
