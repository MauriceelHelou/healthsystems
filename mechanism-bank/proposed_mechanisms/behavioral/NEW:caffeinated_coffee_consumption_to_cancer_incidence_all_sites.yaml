direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Caffeinated coffee contains bioactive compounds including caffeine, chlorogenic
  acids, diterpenes, and other polyphenols that are absorbed systemically'
- 'Step 2: These compounds exert antioxidant effects, reducing oxidative DNA damage
  and cellular stress that can initiate carcinogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Chlorogenic acids and other polyphenols modulate inflammatory pathways
  and reduce chronic inflammation, a known cancer promoter'
- 'Step 4: Caffeine and coffee compounds may influence insulin sensitivity and glucose
  metabolism, reducing hyperinsulinemia which is linked to endometrial and liver cancer
  risk'
- 'Step 5: For skin cancers, caffeine may enhance apoptosis of UV-damaged cells and
  provide photoprotective effects through DNA repair enhancement'
- 'Step 6: In the liver specifically, coffee compounds reduce hepatic fibrosis and
  inflammation, lowering hepatocellular carcinoma risk'

description: Meta-analysis of 26 prospective studies with over 3.7 million participants
  demonstrates that caffeinated coffee consumption is inversely associated with multiple
  cancer types. Significant protective associations were found for endometrial cancer
  (RR=0.85), melanoma (RR=0.89), and nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR=0.92). Hepatocellular
  carcinoma showed a non-significant inverse association (RR=0.93). The dose-response
  relationship was linear for cancer outcomes, meaning greater consumption was associated
  with progressively lower risk. Current US coffee consumption patterns may account
  for 6-12% of avoided cancer cases depending on the cancer type.
