direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol and drug use impairs judgment, risk assessment, and threat detection
  capabilities, reducing a woman''s ability to recognize warning signs of potential
  violence in new or ongoing relationships'
- 'Step 2: Substance use may serve as a maladaptive coping mechanism following initial
  IPV exposure, creating dependency that limits resources and options for leaving
  abusive situations'
- 'Step 3: Intoxication increases vulnerability during social interactions and may
  attract or enable abusive partners who exploit impaired states'
- 'Step 4: Substance use can contribute to relationship instability, conflict escalation,
  and selection of partners with similar substance use patterns who may be more prone
  to violence'
- 'Step 5: The combination of impaired self-protective behaviors and increased exposure
  to high-risk situations elevates the likelihood of experiencing repeated intimate
  partner violence'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies identified alcohol
  and drug use as a significant risk factor for intimate partner violence revictimization
  in women. Substance use increases vulnerability through multiple pathways including
  impaired judgment, maladaptive coping, and increased exposure to high-risk situations
  and partners. This relationship exists alongside other significant risk factors
  including childhood abuse, recent physical violence severity, and PTSD symptomatology.
