direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth who experience enjoyment and satisfaction during sports participation
  develop positive emotional associations with physical activity and their sport environment'
- 'Step 2: These positive psychological experiences reinforce intrinsic motivation,
  commitment to the sport, and perception of personal competence and success'
- 'Step 3: Higher enjoyment and satisfaction serve as protective psychological factors
  that buffer against common dropout triggers (time demands, competing interests,
  burnout)'
- 'Step 4: Youth with greater sports enjoyment and satisfaction demonstrate increased
  persistence in sport participation and reduced likelihood of dropout'

description: This systematic review of 11 studies found that enjoyment and sports
  satisfaction are protective psychological factors against youth sport dropout. Youth
  who experience higher levels of enjoyment and satisfaction with their sport participation
  demonstrate greater persistence and lower dropout rates. These psychological factors
  work alongside other protective elements including perception of ability and success,
  goal orientation, motivation, and commitment to reduce dropout likelihood.
