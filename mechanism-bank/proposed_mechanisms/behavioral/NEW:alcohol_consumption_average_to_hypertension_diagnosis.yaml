direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular alcohol consumption leads to direct effects on cardiovascular physiology,
  including activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased heart rate'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol intake promotes vascular dysfunction through oxidative
  stress, inflammation, and endothelial damage'
- 'Step 3: These cumulative effects result in sustained elevation of systolic blood
  pressure over time'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged exposure to elevated blood pressure leads to clinical diagnosis
  of hypertension, with risk proportional to average time exposed to higher blood
  pressure levels'

description: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis found that no level
  of alcohol intake was associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension in
  either sex. Evidence indicates alcohol consumption, even at levels typically considered
  'moderate', is causally associated with elevated blood pressure. The relationship
  shows a cumulative effect where systolic blood pressure exposure is proportional
  to average time exposed to elevated levels, accelerating age-related changes in
  blood pressure.

  description: Effects of alcohol on hypertension appear more pronounced in men than
    in women. Both the meta-analysis by Roerecke et al. and cross-sectional study
    by Piano et al. found less pronounced effects in women.

  description: Episodic heavy drinking (binge drinking) was associated with elevated
    systolic blood pressure in men, suggesting pattern of consumption matters beyond
    average volume
- name: age_at_exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Drinking habits adopted in early adulthood and middle age correlate
    with premorbid cardiovascular indicators; earlier exposure leads to cumulative
    effects on blood pressure
