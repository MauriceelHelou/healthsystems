direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cancer survivors engage in structured exercise programs measured in metabolic
  equivalents (METs)-min/week, which quantifies energy expenditure across different
  exercise types and intensities'
- 'Step 2: Regular exercise at optimal doses (approximately 850 METs-min/week) triggers
  physiological adaptations including improved cardiovascular function, muscular strength,
  and reduced fatigue'
- 'Step 3: Physical improvements translate to enhanced functional capacity, reduced
  treatment-related side effects, and improved psychological well-being'
- 'Step 4: These multidimensional improvements manifest as measurable gains in health-related
  quality of life domains including physical functioning, emotional well-being, and
  social participation'
- 'Step 5: A dose-response relationship exists with diminishing returns observed beyond
  1,100 METs-min/week, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window'

description: 'Exercise dose measured in METs-min/week demonstrates a positive dose-response
  relationship with health-related quality of life in cancer survivors. A Bayesian
  network meta-analysis of 48 RCTs involving 3,050 participants identified 850 METs-min/week
  as the optimal exercise dose (SMD: 0.753), with mixed training emerging as the most
  effective modality. The relationship follows a curvilinear pattern with diminishing
  returns beyond 1,100 METs-min/week.'
