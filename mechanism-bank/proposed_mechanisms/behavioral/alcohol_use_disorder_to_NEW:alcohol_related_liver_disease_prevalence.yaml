- 'Step 1: Alcohol Use Disorder leads to chronic, excessive alcohol consumption with
  average daily intake of 146.6 g/d among affected individuals'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol exposure (>20 years in 54.8% of cases) causes direct
  hepatotoxicity through acetaldehyde production and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Repeated hepatic injury progresses through stages from steatosis to alcoholic
  hepatitis to cirrhosis (32.9% of ARLD spectrum)'
- 'Step 4: Liver damage manifests as alcohol-related liver disease with complications
  including ascites (25.1% prevalence) and increased mortality (23.9% overall, 21.6%
  liver-related)'

description: Alcohol Use Disorder directly causes alcohol-related liver disease through
  chronic hepatotoxic exposure. Global prevalence of ARLD is 4.8%, with alcoholic
  liver cirrhosis comprising 32.9% of the disease spectrum. The pathway involves sustained
  heavy alcohol consumption (average 146.6 g/d) over extended periods (>20 years in
  majority), leading to progressive liver damage through direct toxic effects, oxidative
  stress, and inflammatory cascades. Disease severity and mortality (23.9%) are influenced
  by sex, drinking duration, daily consumption, and comorbidities including smoking
  and viral hepatitis coinfection.
