direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prison needle exchange programs provide sterile injection equipment to
  incarcerated persons who inject drugs'
- 'Step 2: Access to clean needles reduces sharing of contaminated injection equipment
  among prisoners'
- 'Step 3: Reduced needle sharing decreases blood-to-blood contact transmission opportunities
  for hepatitis C virus'
- 'Step 4: Lower HCV transmission rates result in decreased hepatitis C incidence
  within prison populations'

description: Needle exchange programs in prisons have a preventive effect on hepatitis
  C infection by providing sterile injection equipment to incarcerated persons who
  use drugs. This intervention addresses the extremely elevated HCV risk in prison
  populations (48-69 times higher than general population in Germany) by interrupting
  the primary transmission route through contaminated needles. However, these programs
  have been discontinued in most penal facilities despite evidence of effectiveness.
