  node_name: Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ultra-processed foods are consumed regularly, characterized by high energy
  density, added sugars, unhealthy fats, and low fiber content as classified by the
  NOVA food classification system'
- 'Step 2: Chronic caloric excess from UPF consumption promotes positive energy balance,
  leading to weight gain and development of overweight/obesity'
- 'Step 3: Excess caloric intake and associated metabolic dysfunction promote hepatic
  de novo lipogenesis and increased free fatty acid flux to the liver'
- 'Step 4: Accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes leads to hepatic steatosis,
  the hallmark of NAFLD'
- 'Step 5: UPF consumption also contributes to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes,
  which are strongly associated with NAFLD progression'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 studies (3 cross-sectional,
  3 case-control, 3 cohort) analyzing 60,961 individuals found that ultra-processed
  food consumption is significantly associated with increased risk of non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease. The relationship shows a dose-response effect, with high UPF
  intake associated with 42% increased risk of NAFLD compared to low intake. The mechanism
  operates through chronic caloric excess, promotion of obesity, metabolic syndrome,
  and type 2 diabetes, all of which contribute to hepatic fat accumulation.
