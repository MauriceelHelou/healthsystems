direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Self-injurious behaviors indicate underlying emotional dysregulation and
  maladaptive coping mechanisms that complicate eating disorder treatment'
- 'Step 2: Co-occurring self-harm behaviors may reflect more severe psychopathology,
  including comorbid mood disorders, trauma history, or personality pathology that
  interferes with treatment engagement'
- 'Step 3: The presence of self-injurious behaviors may compete with or undermine
  therapeutic interventions focused on eating disorder recovery, diverting clinical
  attention and resources'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with both eating disorders and self-injurious behaviors demonstrate
  reduced capacity to develop healthier coping strategies necessary for sustained
  recovery from disordered eating patterns'

description: Self-injurious behaviors are significantly associated with lower recovery
  rates in pooled eating disorders. This large-scale meta-analysis of 415 studies
  (N=88,372) found that the presence of self-injurious behaviors serves as a negative
  prognostic factor for eating disorder recovery, likely reflecting more complex psychopathology
  and emotional dysregulation that impedes treatment response.

  description: Children/adolescents had more favorable outcomes across and within
    eating disorders than adults, suggesting the negative impact of self-injurious
    behaviors may be more pronounced in adult populations with longer illness duration

  description: Higher socio-demographic index moderated lower recovery and higher
    chronicity in anorexia nervosa, potentially interacting with self-injurious behavior
    effects

  strength: moderate
  description: Specific treatments including DBT (designed to address self-harm) and
    CBT were associated with higher recovery rates, potentially mitigating the negative
    impact of self-injurious behaviors
