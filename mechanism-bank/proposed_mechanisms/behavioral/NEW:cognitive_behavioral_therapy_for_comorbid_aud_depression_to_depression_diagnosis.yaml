direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CBT targets maladaptive thought patterns and cognitive distortions common
  in comorbid AUD-depression, helping patients identify and challenge negative automatic
  thoughts'
- 'Step 2: Behavioral activation components increase engagement in rewarding activities
  and reduce avoidance behaviors that perpetuate both depression and alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Skill-building in coping strategies provides alternative mechanisms for
  emotional regulation beyond alcohol use, reducing depressive rumination'
- 'Step 4: Integrated treatment addresses the bidirectional relationship between alcohol
  use and depression, breaking the cycle where each condition exacerbates the other'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by standardized assessments
  with large effect size (SMD = -0.84)'

description: Cognitive behavioral therapy demonstrates a large beneficial effect on
  reducing depressive symptoms in adults with comorbid alcohol use disorder and depression.
  A network meta-analysis of 36 RCTs with 2,729 participants found CBT adjunctive
  to treatment as usual produced significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms
  compared to no additional treatment (SMD = -0.84), with moderate confidence in this
  estimate. CBT also showed modest benefits for reducing alcohol use (SMD = -0.25).
  The integrated approach addresses both conditions simultaneously through cognitive
  restructuring and behavioral strategies.
