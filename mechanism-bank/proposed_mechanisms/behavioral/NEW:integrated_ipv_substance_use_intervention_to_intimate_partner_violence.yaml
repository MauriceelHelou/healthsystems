direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated interventions combine cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational
  interviewing to simultaneously address both IPV perpetration and substance use behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Treatment targets the interconnected nature of substance use and IPV, recognizing
  that substance use may disinhibit violent behavior or that both behaviors share
  common cognitive and emotional antecedents'
- 'Step 3: Individual trials show some reduction in IPV perpetration at various time
  points compared to treatment as usual, though meta-analytic evidence shows no significant
  difference versus standard substance use treatment'
- 'Step 4: The intervention aims to reduce IPV perpetration through dual behavioral
  change targeting both the violence and the co-occurring substance use'

description: Integrated IPV and substance use interventions employ cognitive behavioral
  and motivational interviewing approaches to simultaneously target both violent behavior
  and substance use among male perpetrators. While individual trials (n=3) showed
  some reduction in IPV perpetration at different time points compared to treatment
  as usual, meta-analysis of 4 trials found no significant difference in IPV outcomes
  when integrated interventions were compared to standard substance use treatment.
  The evidence suggests limited effectiveness of current integrated approaches.
