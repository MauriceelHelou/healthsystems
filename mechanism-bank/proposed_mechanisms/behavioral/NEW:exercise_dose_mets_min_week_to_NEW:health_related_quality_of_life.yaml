mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exercise at specific doses (measured in METs-min/week) induces physiological
  adaptations including improved cardiovascular function, muscle strength, and metabolic
  regulation'
- 'Step 2: These physiological improvements enhance functional capacity and reduce
  cancer-related fatigue, pain, and physical limitations'
- 'Step 3: Improved physical function translates to better performance in daily activities
  and enhanced psychological well-being through increased self-efficacy and reduced
  depression/anxiety'
- 'Step 4: The combination of physical and psychological benefits culminates in improved
  health-related quality of life, with optimal benefits observed at approximately
  850 METs-min/week and diminishing returns beyond 1,100 METs-min/week'

description: 'Exercise dose measured in METs-min/week demonstrates a dose-response
  relationship with health-related quality of life in cancer survivors. The optimal
  dose across all exercise types is 850 METs-min/week, producing a moderate-to-large
  effect (SMD: 0.753). Mixed training combining aerobic and resistance components
  shows the strongest benefits, while diminishing returns occur above 1,100 METs-min/week.'
