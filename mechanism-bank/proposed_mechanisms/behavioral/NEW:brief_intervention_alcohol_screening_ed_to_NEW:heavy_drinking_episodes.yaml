direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients presenting to emergency departments with alcohol-related injuries
  or intoxication are screened to identify hazardous drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions (ranging from minimal feedback to more structured counseling)
  are delivered, which may include motivational interviewing techniques, personalized
  feedback on drinking risks, and goal-setting'
- 'Step 3: The intervention triggers cognitive processes including increased awareness
  of drinking harms, self-reflection on drinking behavior, and enhanced motivation
  to change'
- 'Step 4: Patients reduce the frequency and intensity of heavy drinking episodes
  as a behavioral response to the intervention, with effects persisting at 3-, 6-,
  and 12-month follow-up periods'

description: A meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials with 14,456 patients
  found that brief interventions with alcohol screening in emergency department settings
  produce small but statistically significant reductions in heavy drinking episodes.
  The effect sizes across follow-up periods (3, 6, and 12 months) were modest (highest
  SMD = 0.19), indicating that while the intervention is effective, the magnitude
  of benefit is limited. Importantly, more intensive interventions did not outperform
  shorter approaches, suggesting that minimal interventions may be equally cost-effective.
