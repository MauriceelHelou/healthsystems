to_node:

  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults with hazardous drinking receive automated text message interventions
  providing feedback on their alcohol consumption patterns on typical drinking days'
- 'Step 2: Feedback on actual drinking amounts increases self-awareness and conscious
  reflection on drinking behavior, enabling individuals to recognize discrepancies
  between actual and intended consumption'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced awareness facilitates behavioral self-regulation and motivation
  to reduce excessive drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement with consumption feedback over 12 weeks leads to durable
  reductions in binge drinking days'

description: Automated text message interventions providing feedback on alcohol consumption
  significantly reduce binge drinking days among non-treatment seeking young adults
  with hazardous drinking. The USE intervention (alcohol consumption feedback) decreased
  mean binge drinking days from 3.3 to 2.9 at 3 months compared to the control condition
  where binge drinking increased from 2.7 to 3.4 days. Effects persisted at 6-month
  follow-up.
