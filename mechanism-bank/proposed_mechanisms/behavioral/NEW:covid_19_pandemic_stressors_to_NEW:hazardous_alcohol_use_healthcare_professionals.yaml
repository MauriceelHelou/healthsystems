mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates unprecedented high-pressure and demanding work
  environments for healthcare professionals, including increased patient mortality,
  fear of infection, staff shortages, and extended work hours'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare professionals experience elevated psychological distress, trauma,
  and burnout due to pandemic-related occupational stressors'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare professionals adopt alcohol use as a maladaptive coping strategy
  to manage pandemic-related stress and trauma'
- 'Step 4: Prevalence of hazardous alcohol use increases from pre-pandemic baseline
  (17.95%) to pandemic period levels (28.19%), representing a 57% relative increase'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 64 studies demonstrates that
  approximately one-fifth of healthcare professionals engage in hazardous alcohol
  use, with prevalence increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic period
  showed a prevalence of 28.19% for hazardous drinking compared to 17.95% pre-pandemic,
  suggesting healthcare professionals used alcohol to cope with additional trauma
  and stressors associated with the pandemic. The authors conclude that healthcare
  professionals may adopt alcohol as a coping mechanism for high-pressure work environments.
