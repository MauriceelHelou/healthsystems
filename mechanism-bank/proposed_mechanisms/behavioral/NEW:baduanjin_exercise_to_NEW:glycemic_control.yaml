direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular practice of Baduanjin exercise involves slow, coordinated movements
  combined with controlled breathing and mental focus, engaging both physical and
  psychological systems'
- 'Step 2: The mind-body exercise improves psychological well-being by reducing depression,
  anxiety, and stress, which are known to dysregulate glucose metabolism through cortisol
  and inflammatory pathways'
- 'Step 3: Physical activity component increases muscle glucose uptake and insulin
  sensitivity through enhanced GLUT4 transporter activity and improved peripheral
  glucose utilization'
- 'Step 4: Combined physical-psychological benefits lead to measurable improvements
  in fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and 2-hour postprandial
  blood glucose (2-hPBG)'

description: Baduanjin exercise, a traditional Chinese mind-body practice, improves
  glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients through integrated physical and psychological
  mechanisms. Meta-analysis of 27 RCTs demonstrates moderate positive effects on FBG
  (SMD=0.53), HbA1c (SMD=0.58), and 2-hPBG (SMD=0.56) compared to usual care. The
  dual action of physical activity enhancing glucose metabolism combined with stress
  reduction improving neuroendocrine regulation creates a comprehensive therapeutic
  approach for diabetes management.
