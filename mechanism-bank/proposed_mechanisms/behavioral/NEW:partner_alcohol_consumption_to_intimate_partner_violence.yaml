direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Partner engages in frequent alcohol consumption or episodes of getting
  drunk'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol intoxication impairs judgment, reduces inhibitions, and increases
  aggressive behavior'
- 'Step 3: Impaired cognitive function and disinhibition lead to reduced respect for
  partner''s autonomy and consent'
- 'Step 4: Partner is more likely to coerce or force sexual acts upon their intimate
  partner'
- 'Step 5: Increased risk of sexual intimate partner violence, with higher odds among
  women whose partners often or sometimes get drunk'

description: Partner's frequency of getting drunk is a significant determinant of
  sexual intimate partner violence. Women whose partners often or sometimes get drunk
  have higher odds of experiencing sexual IPV compared to those whose partners do
  not drink or rarely get drunk. This relationship operates through behavioral disinhibition
  and impaired judgment associated with alcohol intoxication, which reduces impulse
  control and increases aggressive sexual behavior. The study found this pattern consistent
  across disability status, though women with disabilities face compounded vulnerability.
