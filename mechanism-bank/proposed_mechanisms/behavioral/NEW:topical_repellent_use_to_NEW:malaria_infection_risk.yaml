direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals apply topical repellents containing active ingredients (e.g.,
  DEET, picaridin) to exposed skin surfaces'
- 'Step 2: Repellent chemicals create a vapor barrier that interferes with mosquito
  host-seeking behavior by disrupting olfactory receptors'
- 'Step 3: Anopheles mosquitoes are deterred from landing on and biting treated skin
  surfaces during outdoor activities or sleeping hours'
- 'Step 4: Reduced human-vector contact decreases the probability of infectious Plasmodium
  sporozoite transmission from infected mosquitoes'
- 'Step 5: Lower sporozoite inoculation rates result in reduced malaria infection
  incidence at the individual and population level'

description: Topical repellents provide personal protection against malaria-transmitting
  Anopheles mosquitoes by creating a chemical barrier that deters mosquito landing
  and biting. A systematic review and meta-analysis of vector control interventions
  during humanitarian emergencies found that topical repellent use was associated
  with a 42% reduction in malaria infection risk (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.97) with
  moderate certainty evidence. This protective effect operates through reduced human-vector
  contact, thereby decreasing opportunities for Plasmodium parasite transmission.
