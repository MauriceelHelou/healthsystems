direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) involves applying long-lasting insecticides
  to interior walls and surfaces of dwellings where malaria-transmitting mosquitoes
  rest'
- 'Step 2: When Anopheles mosquitoes enter treated homes and rest on sprayed surfaces,
  they absorb lethal doses of insecticide, leading to mosquito mortality'
- 'Step 3: Reduced mosquito populations and shortened mosquito lifespans decrease
  the probability of successful malaria parasite transmission to humans'
- 'Step 4: Lower transmission rates result in decreased Plasmodium falciparum and
  Plasmodium vivax infection and clinical malaria incidence in the protected population'

description: Indoor residual spraying reduces malaria incidence by killing or repelling
  mosquito vectors when they rest on treated indoor surfaces. Meta-analysis evidence
  shows approximately 43% reduction in P. falciparum incidence and 49% reduction in
  P. vivax incidence in humanitarian emergency settings, though evidence certainty
  was rated as very low due to study design limitations.
