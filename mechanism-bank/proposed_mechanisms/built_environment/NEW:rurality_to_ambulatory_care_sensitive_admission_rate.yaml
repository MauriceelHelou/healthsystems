  node_id: ambulatory_care_sensitive_admission_rate
  node_name: Avoidable Hospitalizations
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural communities have lower density of primary care physicians and medical
  specialists, reducing access to timely ambulatory care'
- 'Step 2: Geographic barriers including distance to healthcare facilities and limited
  transportation options delay or prevent outpatient medical visits'
- 'Step 3: Delayed or inadequate ambulatory care management of chronic conditions
  (diabetes, heart failure, COPD, asthma) leads to disease exacerbation'
- 'Step 4: When conditions deteriorate beyond outpatient management capacity, hospitalization
  becomes necessary for conditions that could have been prevented with appropriate
  primary care'

description: Rurality is significantly associated with increased rates of avoidable
  hospitalizations. This multilevel Poisson regression analysis of Swiss hospital
  service areas (2008-2010) demonstrated that as the proportion of residences in rural
  communities increased, rates of all avoidable hospitalizations significantly increased.
  The relationship persists after controlling for physician density, hospital bed
  density, and reimbursement system type.
