category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Improved cookstove (ICS) interventions replace traditional open-fire or
  inefficient cooking methods with more efficient combustion technology'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced combustion efficiency and better ventilation designs reduce emissions
  of particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, and other pollutants during cooking'
- 'Step 3: Reduced pollutant emissions directly decrease household air pollution concentrations
  in cooking areas and living spaces'
- 'Step 4: Lower household air pollution exposure reduces inhalation of harmful combustion
  byproducts by household members, particularly women and young children who spend
  more time near cooking areas'

description: Improved cookstove interventions reduce household air pollution exposure
  by providing more efficient combustion technology that produces fewer emissions
  of particulate matter and other pollutants compared to traditional cooking methods
  using solid biomass fuels. This systematic review of 13 studies in LMICs demonstrated
  that while direct HAP measurements were variably reported, ICS interventions showed
  downstream health benefits consistent with reduced pollution exposure, including
  reduced childhood burns and low birth weight risk.
