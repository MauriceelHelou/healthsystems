mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to natural disasters (floods, cyclones, heatwaves, river erosion)
  creates acute traumatic experiences including life-threatening situations, property
  destruction, and displacement'
- 'Step 2: Direct traumatic exposure leads to physical injury, loss of family members,
  destruction of homes and livelihoods, and disruption of social support networks'
- 'Step 3: These traumatic experiences trigger persistent psychological responses
  including intrusive memories, hyperarousal, and avoidance behaviors characteristic
  of PTSD'
- 'Step 4: Secondary stressors including food crisis, income loss, displacement, and
  ongoing environmental vulnerability perpetuate and exacerbate PTSD symptoms'

description: Natural disaster exposure (floods, cyclones, heatwaves, river erosion)
  leads to post-traumatic stress disorder through direct traumatic experiences and
  secondary stressors. A systematic review of 17 studies in Bangladesh identified
  PTSD as a major mental health consequence of natural disasters. The pathway operates
  through acute trauma exposure (life-threatening events, physical injury, witnessing
  destruction) combined with chronic stressors (displacement, economic loss, food
  insecurity) that perpetuate psychological distress.
