direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets increases physical availability and accessibility
  of alcohol within a geographic area'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability facilitates higher alcohol consumption and binge
  drinking among local populations'
- 'Step 3: Elevated alcohol consumption impairs judgment, reduces inhibitions, and
  increases aggressive behavior'
- 'Step 4: Concentration of drinking establishments creates environments where intoxicated
  individuals congregate, increasing potential for interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 5: These factors combine to increase rates of alcohol-related violent crime
  against persons in areas with higher outlet density'

description: Higher alcohol outlet density increases alcohol availability, which elevates
  consumption and binge drinking in the population. This leads to increased alcohol-related
  violent crime through mechanisms including impaired judgment, reduced inhibitions,
  and concentration of intoxicated individuals in areas with many outlets. The CHALICE
  study uses a natural experiment design with longitudinal data linkage to examine
  this relationship at both individual and area levels.
