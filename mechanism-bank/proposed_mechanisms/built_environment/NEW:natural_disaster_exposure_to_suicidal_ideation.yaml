mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Natural disasters (floods, cyclones, heatwaves, river erosion) cause direct
  physical damage to homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods'
- 'Step 2: Displacement, loss of property, death of family members, loss of livestock,
  and food insecurity create acute and chronic psychological stress'
- 'Step 3: These traumatic experiences and ongoing stressors trigger mental health
  conditions including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and stress disorders'
- 'Step 4: Compounding factors such as lack of social support, financial hardship,
  physical injuries, and family conflicts exacerbate psychological distress'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated mental health burden and hopelessness associated with loss
  and uncertain future lead to suicidal ideation'

description: Natural disaster exposure in Bangladesh is positively associated with
  suicidal ideation, with prevalence ranging from 10.9% to 57.5% among affected populations.
  The pathway operates through multiple interconnected mechanisms including traumatic
  loss, displacement, economic devastation, and development of comorbid mental health
  conditions such as depression (16.3-92.71%), anxiety (6-92.19%), stress (32.41-58%),
  and PTSD. Vulnerable populations including those with lower education, limited resources,
  and inadequate social support face elevated risks.
