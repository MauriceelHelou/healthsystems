mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher educational attainment increases health literacy, enabling women
  to understand the importance of maternal health services including antenatal care,
  skilled delivery, and postnatal care'
- 'Step 2: Education improves women''s autonomy and decision-making power within households,
  allowing them greater control over health-seeking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: More educated women have better access to information about available health
  services and can navigate healthcare systems more effectively'
- 'Step 4: Education is associated with higher socioeconomic status and employment
  opportunities, reducing financial barriers to accessing maternal health services'
- 'Step 5: Educated women are more likely to recognize pregnancy danger signs and
  seek timely professional care, increasing overall utilization of maternal health
  services'

description: Educational attainment demonstrates a strong, graded positive association
  with maternal health care service utilization in developing countries. Women with
  primary education are twice as likely to utilize antenatal care compared to uneducated
  women, while those with secondary and higher education show 6-fold and 14-fold increases
  respectively. This relationship extends across the continuum of maternal care including
  skilled delivery and postnatal services. The mechanism operates through improved
  health literacy, enhanced autonomy, better economic resources, and increased ability
  to navigate healthcare systems.
