mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cochlear implantation restores or significantly improves auditory perception
  in adults with severe-to-profound hearing loss'
- 'Step 2: Improved hearing ability enhances communication capabilities, reducing
  barriers to verbal interaction and conversation in social settings'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced communication facilitates engagement in group activities, social
  gatherings, and community events'
- 'Step 4: Increased autonomy and reduced perceived hearing disability encourage participation
  in education, work, and leisure activities'
- 'Step 5: Greater social participation leads to improved quality of life and continued
  engagement in social events'

description: Cochlear implantation improves social participation in adults with hearing
  loss by restoring auditory function, which enables better communication and reduces
  barriers to social interaction. A systematic review of 44 studies found that 14
  out of 15 studies (93.3%) examining social participation showed improvements post-cochlear
  implantation. The mechanism operates through improved hearing leading to enhanced
  social interactions, greater autonomy, and improved working lives, all of which
  facilitate engagement in social events and activities.
