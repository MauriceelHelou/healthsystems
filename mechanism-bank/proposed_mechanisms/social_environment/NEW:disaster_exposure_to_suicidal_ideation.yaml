- 'Step 1: Exposure to disasters and mass casualty incidents causes physical injuries,
  economic losses, and social disruption'
- 'Step 2: These multidimensional losses trigger psychological distress including
  anxiety, stress, and depression'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated psychological burden, loss of resources, and disrupted social
  support networks contribute to hopelessness and suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Suicidal ideation may progress to suicide attempts in vulnerable individuals,
  particularly those lacking adequate mental health support'

description: Exposure to disasters and mass casualty incidents significantly increases
  the prevalence of suicidal ideation, with an overall pooled prevalence of 12.9%
  among affected populations. This meta-analysis of 33 studies with over 61,000 participants
  demonstrates that the physical, economic, and social injuries resulting from disasters
  lead to mental disorders including anxiety, stress, and depression, which contribute
  to suicidal ideation. Women are particularly vulnerable, showing nearly 50% higher
  rates of suicidal ideation than men post-disaster.
