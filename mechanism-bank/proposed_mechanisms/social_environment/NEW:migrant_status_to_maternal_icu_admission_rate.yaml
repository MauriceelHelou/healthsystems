mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Migrant women face structural barriers to healthcare access including language
  barriers, unfamiliarity with healthcare systems, lack of health insurance coverage,
  and legal restrictions on healthcare entitlements'
- 'Step 2: These barriers lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, resulting in
  later detection and management of pregnancy complications'
- 'Step 3: Migrant women may experience discrimination and implicit bias within healthcare
  settings, leading to suboptimal care quality and clinical decision-making'
- 'Step 4: Unmanaged or poorly managed pregnancy complications progress to severe
  maternal morbidity requiring intensive care unit admission'
- 'Step 5: The pattern varies by host country (stronger in Europe) and region of origin
  (highest for sub-Saharan African, Latin American/Caribbean, and Asian migrants),
  reflecting intersecting social determinants and healthcare system factors'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies found that migrant
  women in high-income countries have elevated risks of severe maternal outcomes including
  ICU admission compared to native-born women. The patterns for maternal ICU admission
  were similar to those observed for maternal mortality, though studied less frequently
  and with heterogeneous outcome definitions. The association varies significantly
  by host country context and migrant region of origin, suggesting complex interactions
  between healthcare system factors, discrimination, and social determinants of health.
