mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adverse social determinants of health including low socioeconomic status,
  limited education, unstable housing, and lack of economic resources constrain household
  financial capacity'
- 'Step 2: Limited financial resources force households to make trade-offs between
  food expenditures and other essential needs (housing, utilities, healthcare)'
- 'Step 3: These resource constraints result in inability to consistently obtain nutritious
  food, leading to food insecurity which disproportionately affects socioeconomically
  disadvantaged households'

description: Social determinants of health, particularly socioeconomic disadvantage,
  directly contribute to food insecurity through resource constraints that prevent
  consistent access to nutritious food. This relationship is well-established and
  disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations including those with chronic diseases.
  Community and individual level factors both contribute to this relationship.
