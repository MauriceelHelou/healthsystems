mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sociodemographic factors including socioeconomic status, ethnicity, geographic
  location, and family structure create differential access to healthcare information
  and services'
- 'Step 2: These factors influence parental and adolescent awareness of HPV vaccination,
  ability to navigate consent processes, and access to vaccination settings (e.g.,
  school-based programs)'
- 'Step 3: Sociodemographic barriers compound with system-level challenges (consent
  acquisition) and psychological barriers (risk perception), leading to delayed or
  refused vaccination'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative effect of sociodemographic disadvantages results in lower
  HPV vaccination coverage among affected populations'

description: Sociodemographic factors represent a key barrier category impacting HPV
  vaccination uptake in the UK. This systematic review of 24 publications identified
  that alongside system-level challenges (consent processes) and psychological/behavioral
  factors (risk perception), sociodemographic factors consistently emerged as important
  barriers to vaccination among both adolescents and parents. These barriers contribute
  to vaccination coverage remaining below 80% and below pre-COVID levels in England.
