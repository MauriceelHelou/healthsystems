mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transitional age youth (18-25) experience homelessness, exposing them to
  chronic stress, unstable living conditions, and lack of safe shelter'
- 'Step 2: Homelessness leads to elevated rates of substance misuse, trauma exposure,
  inadequate nutrition, sleep deprivation, and lack of access to healthcare'
- 'Step 3: These compounding factors contribute to neuropsychological dysfunction
  including deficits in executive function, memory, attention, and cognitive processing'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring psychopathology (mood disorders, PTSD, anxiety) and substance
  use disorders further exacerbate neuropsychological impairments'
- 'Step 5: Limited access to mental health services and treatment interventions prevents
  remediation of neuropsychological deficits'

description: Transitional age youth experiencing homelessness bear a disproportionate
  burden of neuropsychological dysfunction. This systematic review of 32 studies (n=13,516)
  found elevated rates across multiple domains including psychopathology, substance
  misuse, and cognitive impairment. The review noted insufficient data to draw fully
  generalizable conclusions about neuropsychological functioning specifically, but
  identified clear patterns of co-occurring conditions that suggest compounding effects
  on brain function and cognition.
