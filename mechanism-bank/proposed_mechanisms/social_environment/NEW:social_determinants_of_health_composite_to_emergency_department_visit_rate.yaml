direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experiencing homelessness, housing instability, and adverse
  socioeconomic conditions face barriers to accessing routine primary care and preventive
  health services'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing compromises ability to manage chronic conditions,
  store medications, maintain hygiene, and recover from illness'
- 'Step 3: Social determinants create conditions that increase risk of acute health
  crises including infections, injuries, mental health emergencies, and substance
  use complications'
- 'Step 4: Emergency departments serve as safety-net providers for uninsured and underinsured
  populations who cannot access or afford other healthcare settings'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated unmet health needs and social instability lead to higher frequency
  of ED visits for both emergent and non-emergent conditions'

description: Social determinants of health including homelessness, housing instability,
  and socioeconomic factors significantly influence emergency department utilization
  patterns. A scoping review of 590 relevant social emergency medicine publications
  (410 observational studies, 58 interventional studies, 26 systematic reviews) found
  that substantial research documents how social determinants drive ED utilization,
  with the ED serving as a critical safety-net healthcare access point for vulnerable
  populations.
