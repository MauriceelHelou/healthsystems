category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness exposes individuals to chronic environmental stressors including
  lack of stable shelter, food insecurity, and physical danger'
- 'Step 2: These stressors exacerbate pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities and
  trigger new-onset psychiatric conditions through chronic stress pathways'
- 'Step 3: Lack of access to mental healthcare, social support networks, and substance
  treatment services perpetuates and worsens psychiatric morbidity'
- 'Step 4: Substance use disorders develop or worsen as coping mechanisms for street
  life conditions, creating comorbidity with other mental disorders'
- 'Step 5: The resulting high prevalence of mental disorders (76.2% any current mental
  disorder) becomes characteristic of homeless populations'

description: Homelessness is associated with extremely high prevalence of mental disorders,
  with 76.2% of homeless individuals meeting criteria for any current mental disorder.
  The most prevalent conditions are alcohol use disorders (36.7%), drug use disorders
  (21.7%), schizophrenia spectrum disorders (12.4%), and major depression (12.6%).
  The relationship reflects both selection effects (mental illness increasing risk
  of homelessness) and causation (homelessness precipitating or exacerbating mental
  illness through stress, trauma, and lack of access to care).
