mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family members and peers provide emotional encouragement, instrumental
  support (e.g., transportation, equipment), and positive feedback that reinforces
  youth athletes'' engagement in sports'
- 'Step 2: This social support enhances motivation, enjoyment, and sports satisfaction,
  while buffering against negative experiences such as burnout, performance pressure,
  and social isolation'
- 'Step 3: Youth with stronger social support networks develop greater commitment
  to sport participation and perceive fewer barriers to continued involvement'
- 'Step 4: The protective effect of social support reduces the likelihood of dropout
  by maintaining engagement through challenging periods and developmental transitions
  in late adolescence'
