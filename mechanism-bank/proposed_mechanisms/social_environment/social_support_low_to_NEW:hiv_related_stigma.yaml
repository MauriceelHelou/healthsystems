mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with low social support lack protective social networks and
  interpersonal connections that buffer against stigmatizing attitudes and experiences'
- 'Step 2: Without adequate social support, PLWH have fewer resources to cope with
  discrimination, shame, and negative societal perceptions related to their HIV status'
- 'Step 3: The absence of supportive relationships increases vulnerability to internalizing
  stigma and experiencing more frequent instances of enacted stigma from others'
- 'Step 4: Low social support leaves individuals isolated, amplifying the psychological
  impact of HIV-related stigma and reducing access to stigma-reduction resources'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 studies with 9,548 participants
  found that PLWH with higher levels of social support were less likely to report
  HIV-related stigma. The inverse relationship indicates that low social support is
  associated with increased HIV-related stigma. Social support serves as a protective
  factor against stigma, suggesting that its absence leaves individuals more vulnerable
  to stigmatizing experiences and internalized stigma.
