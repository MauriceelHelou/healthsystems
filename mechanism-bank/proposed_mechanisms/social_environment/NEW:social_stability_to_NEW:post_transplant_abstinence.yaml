direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social stability provides consistent environmental support structures including
  stable housing, employment, and interpersonal relationships'
- 'Step 2: These stable support systems reduce stress-related triggers for alcohol
  use and provide accountability mechanisms for maintaining sobriety'
- 'Step 3: Patients with greater social stability have improved access to follow-up
  care and support networks that reinforce abstinence behaviors'
- 'Step 4: The combination of reduced triggers and enhanced support leads to higher
  rates of sustained abstinence following liver transplantation'

description: A systematic review of 22 studies examining psychosocial selection criteria
  for liver transplant candidates with alcoholic liver disease found that social stability
  has been associated with future abstinence in more studies than not. Social stability
  provides the environmental and interpersonal support structures necessary to maintain
  sobriety following transplantation, reducing relapse triggers and enhancing accountability.
