direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persons experiencing homelessness lack stable housing, forcing reliance
  on congregate shelters with high-density sleeping arrangements that facilitate respiratory
  virus transmission'
- 'Step 2: Homeless individuals have limited access to hygiene facilities, clean water,
  soap, and personal protective equipment (PPE), reducing ability to implement basic
  infection prevention measures'
- 'Step 3: Inability to shelter-in-place or practice physical distancing due to lack
  of private living space increases exposure to infected individuals in public spaces
  and shared facilities'
- 'Step 4: Higher prevalence of underlying health conditions among homeless populations
  (respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, compromised immune systems) increases
  susceptibility to infection upon exposure'
- 'Step 5: Barriers to healthcare access delay testing, diagnosis, and treatment,
  allowing continued community transmission'

description: Homelessness significantly increases COVID-19 infection risk through
  multiple interconnected pathways. Persons experiencing homelessness face heightened
  exposure due to congregate living conditions in shelters, inability to practice
  physical distancing, and limited access to hygiene resources and PPE. The scoping
  review of 96 studies documented elevated SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, morbidity,
  mortality, and hospitalization among homeless populations. Structural factors including
  lack of stable housing, healthcare access barriers, and higher prevalence of underlying
  health conditions compound infection vulnerability.
