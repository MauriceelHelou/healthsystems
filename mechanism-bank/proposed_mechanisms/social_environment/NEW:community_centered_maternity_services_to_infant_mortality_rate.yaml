mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community-centered maternity services take a place-based approach, designing
  interventions that suit the specific needs, cultural norms, and context of local
  communities'
- 'Step 2: These services enhance accessibility and earlier engagement with prenatal
  care among disadvantaged populations (minority ethnic groups, socially complex circumstances)
  who face higher baseline risk of poor outcomes'
- 'Step 3: Increased attendance and culturally appropriate care improves antenatal
  care coverage, quality of care, and health behaviors including breastfeeding and
  immunization uptake'
- 'Step 4: Better prenatal monitoring and community support reduces rates of preterm
  birth and low birth weight, which are major proximal risk factors for infant mortality'
- 'Step 5: The combination of improved clinical outcomes (reduced preterm birth, low
  birth weight) and enhanced postnatal support through community networks leads to
  reduced infant mortality rates'

description: Community-centered maternity services reduce infant mortality by providing
  place-based, culturally appropriate interventions that address the specific needs
  of disadvantaged communities. This systematic review of 46 studies across high-income
  countries found positive associations between community-centered services and reduced
  maternal, perinatal, and infant mortality, though significance and impact varied
  across studies. The mechanism operates through improved accessibility, earlier care
  engagement, better antenatal coverage, and enhanced health behaviors that reduce
  proximal risk factors like preterm birth and low birth weight.
