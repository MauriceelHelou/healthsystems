mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experiencing homelessness obtain stable housing through various
  pathways including Housing First programs or other housing interventions'
- 'Step 2: Stable housing provides environmental stability that may have ameliorative
  effects on mental health, reducing symptom severity and crisis episodes'
- 'Step 3: Reduced psychiatric symptom burden decreases the perceived need for psychiatric
  and substance use services'
- 'Step 4: Additionally, services may be more accessible and actively sought during
  periods of homelessness when individuals are in contact with shelter systems and
  outreach programs'
- 'Step 5: The combination of improved mental health stability and reduced accessibility/outreach
  results in decreased utilization of psychiatric and substance services among stably
  housed individuals'

description: A 2-year prospective longitudinal study of 255 homeless individuals found
  that stable housing was negatively associated with psychiatric and substance service
  use. The authors propose that obtaining housing may have ameliorative effects on
  mental health, thereby diminishing the perceived need for psychiatric services.
  Additionally, services may be more accessible during homelessness when individuals
  are in contact with shelter and outreach systems. This finding supports Housing
  First policy approaches by demonstrating that housing stability does not increase
  substance use risk while potentially reducing service dependency.
