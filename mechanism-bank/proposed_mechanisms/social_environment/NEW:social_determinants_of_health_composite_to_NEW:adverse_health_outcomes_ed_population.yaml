- 'Step 1: Social determinants including socioeconomic status, housing instability,
  homelessness, and racial disparities create structural barriers to preventive care
  and health maintenance'
- 'Step 2: These social factors influence patterns of emergency department utilization,
  often as a point of care access for populations facing barriers to primary care'
- 'Step 3: Observational research documents that socioeconomic and racial disparities
  predispose ED patients to adverse outcomes through multiple interconnected pathways'
- 'Step 4: The intersection of social factors with emergency care creates differential
  health outcomes, with vulnerable populations experiencing higher rates of adverse
  events'

description: A comprehensive scoping review of 590 relevant publications in social
  emergency medicine documents the relationship between social determinants of health
  and adverse outcomes in ED patients. The review found that many publications describe
  disparities known to predispose ED patients to adverse outcomes, including socioeconomic
  and racial disparities, as well as the influence of social determinants on ED utilization
  patterns. The field spans multiple topic areas including homelessness, housing instability,
  firearm violence, human trafficking, and LGBTQ health.
