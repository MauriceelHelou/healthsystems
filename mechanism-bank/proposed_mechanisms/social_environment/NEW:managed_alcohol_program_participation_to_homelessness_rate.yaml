- 'Step 1: Individuals with severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) experiencing homelessness
  enroll in managed alcohol programs (MAPs)'
- 'Step 2: MAPs provide structured environments with regular, controlled doses of
  alcohol, reducing chaotic drinking patterns and associated harms'
- 'Step 3: Many MAPs integrate housing services and other social supports as core
  program components'
- 'Step 4: Program participation stabilizes participants'' daily routines, reduces
  emergency service utilization, and addresses barriers to housing retention'
- 'Step 5: Improved stability and reduced alcohol-related crises enable participants
  to obtain and maintain housing, reducing homelessness rates'

description: Managed alcohol programs reduce homelessness among individuals with severe
  alcohol use disorder by providing structured, harm-reduction-based interventions
  that include controlled alcohol administration alongside housing and social services.
  This scoping review of 32 studies across 38 established programs demonstrates that
  MAPs address the intersection of substance use and housing instability through integrated
  care approaches.
