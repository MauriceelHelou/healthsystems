direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women with a history of violence (prior IPV or childhood abuse) are more
  likely to remain in or enter relationships with partners who exhibit violent behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Established patterns of violence in relationships tend to persist and often
  escalate during pregnancy due to increased stress, dependency, and relationship
  changes'
- 'Step 3: Prior victimization may normalize violence or reduce self-efficacy for
  leaving abusive relationships, perpetuating the cycle of violence during pregnancy'

description: Five studies within this systematic review demonstrated strong evidence
  that a history of violence is significantly associated with intimate partner violence
  during pregnancy. Women who have experienced prior violence are at substantially
  elevated risk of experiencing IPV when pregnant, suggesting intergenerational and
  relationship-level patterns of violence perpetuation.
