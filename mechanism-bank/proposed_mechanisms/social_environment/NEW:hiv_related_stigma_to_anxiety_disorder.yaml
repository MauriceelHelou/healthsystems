mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: People living with HIV experience HIV-related stigma, which includes social
  discrimination, shame, and negative treatment from healthcare providers and community
  members'
- 'Step 2: This stigma creates chronic psychological stress through fear of disclosure,
  social rejection, and internalized negative self-perceptions'
- 'Step 3: The persistent stress response and emotional distress associated with stigma
  activates anxiety-related neurobiological pathways'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged exposure to stigma-related stressors increases vulnerability
  to developing clinically significant anxiety disorders'
