mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic triggers implementation of strict lockdown measures including
  stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements'
- 'Step 2: Lockdown measures force victims to remain in prolonged close proximity
  with abusive partners, eliminating opportunities for escape or respite'
- 'Step 3: Social isolation reduces access to protective social networks, support
  services, and reporting mechanisms that normally help detect and prevent abuse'
- 'Step 4: Economic stressors from pandemic (job loss, financial insecurity) exacerbate
  household tensions and conflict triggers'
- 'Step 5: Restricted access to healthcare and social services limits victims'' ability
  to seek help or report violence'
- 'Step 6: Resulting in elevated prevalence of all forms of intimate partner violence
  (physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse)'

description: COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures are associated with elevated intimate
  partner violence, with a pooled global prevalence of 31% among women during the
  pandemic. The meta-analysis of 14 studies demonstrates that stay-at-home orders
  and social distancing requirements created conditions conducive to abuse by trapping
  victims with perpetrators, eliminating escape routes and external oversight, and
  generating economic stressors. All forms of IPV (physical, sexual, emotional, and
  economic) were prevalent, indicating a comprehensive increase in violence rather
  than specific subtypes.
