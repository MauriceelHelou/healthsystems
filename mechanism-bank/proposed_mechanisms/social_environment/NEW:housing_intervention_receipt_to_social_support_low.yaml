description: This systematic review of 29 studies found that housing interventions
  for chronically homeless individuals are associated with positive changes in social
  support. Nearly all included studies demonstrated that changes in social support
  were associated with housing interventions, with the substantial evidence base indicating
  largely positive intervention effects on social support outcomes. Housing stability
  facilitates community integration and enables the development and maintenance of
  social networks that reduce isolation.
