direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MSM identity exposes individuals to minority stress including discrimination,
  stigma, prejudice, and social rejection based on sexual orientation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure to minority stressors leads to internalized homophobia,
  concealment stress, and expectations of rejection'
- 'Step 3: These psychosocial stressors contribute to elevated rates of depression,
  anxiety, and psychological distress'
- 'Step 4: Mental health burden combined with social isolation and lack of support
  systems increases vulnerability to suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 5: Additional risk factors including HIV status further compound mental health
  challenges and suicidal ideation risk'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that 21% of MSM experience
  suicidal ideation, which is substantially higher than rates observed in the general
  male population. The elevated prevalence is attributed to minority stress factors
  including discrimination, stigma, and social marginalization that MSM face due to
  their sexual orientation. HIV-positive MSM face nearly double the risk of suicidal
  ideation (40%), indicating compounding health-related stressors.
