mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) receive
  antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as treatment'
- 'Step 2: AEDs modulate neuronal excitability through various mechanisms including
  GABA enhancement and sodium/calcium channel blockade'
- 'Step 3: Despite theoretical neurobiological rationale, AEDs show no significant
  benefit in reducing withdrawal syndrome severity measured by clinical scales'
- 'Step 4: AEDs demonstrate no reduction in progression to delirium tremens or seizure
  prevention compared to placebo or other treatments'
- 'Step 5: AWS severity remains largely unchanged with AED treatment, indicating neutral
  to ineffective impact on clinical outcomes'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled
  trials (1709 patients) found that antiepileptic drugs do not significantly improve
  alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity or prevent complications. AEDs showed no benefit
  in reducing withdrawal severity measured by clinical scales, no reduction in delirium
  tremens development, and no difference in seizure incidence compared to placebo
  or other treatments. The evidence supports a weak recommendation against routine
  AED use in moderate to severe AWS unless indicated for comorbid conditions.
