mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Falls prevention interventions (exercise programs, environmental modifications,
  medication review, vision correction, assistive devices) are implemented for adults
  aged 65+ years'
- 'Step 2: These interventions address modifiable risk factors including muscle weakness,
  balance deficits, environmental hazards, polypharmacy, and visual impairment'
- 'Step 3: Reduced frequency and severity of falls leads to fewer injurious falls
  requiring medical attention'
- 'Step 4: Decreased injurious falls results in reduced hospitalizations due to fall-related
  injuries (fractures, head trauma, soft tissue injuries)'

description: Falls prevention interventions reduce fall-related hospitalizations by
  addressing modifiable risk factors for falls in older adults. The protocol outlines
  that hospitalizations due to falls is a primary outcome measure, indicating the
  established causal pathway from intervention implementation to reduced healthcare
  utilization through decreased fall incidence and severity.
