mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist, is administered to patients with alcohol
  use disorder (AUD) co-morbid with liver diseases'
- 'Step 2: Baclofen reduces alcohol craving through GABAergic modulation, which is
  implicated in the reward pathways associated with alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 3: Reduced craving supports patients in maintaining abstinence from alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Overall abstinence rate of 53% observed in patients with AUD and liver
  disease receiving baclofen treatment'

description: 'Baclofen treatment demonstrates a potential positive effect on alcohol
  abstinence rates in patients with alcohol use disorder co-morbid with liver diseases.
  The meta-analysis of 5 studies showed an overall abstinence rate of 53%, though
  when compared directly to placebo in RCTs, the difference was not statistically
  significant (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 0.41-4.92). Baclofen is notable as the only drug
  investigated in randomized controlled trials specifically for anti-craving in this
  population with liver disease.'
