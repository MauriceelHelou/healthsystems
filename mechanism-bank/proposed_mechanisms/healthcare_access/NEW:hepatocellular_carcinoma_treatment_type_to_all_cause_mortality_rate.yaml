mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with early or very early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma who are
  eligible for surgery may receive either surgical resection or radiofrequency ablation
  as treatment options'
- 'Step 2: Surgery involves direct tumor removal through hepatic resection, while
  radiofrequency ablation uses thermal energy to destroy tumor cells through a minimally
  invasive approach'
- 'Step 3: Both treatments aim to achieve complete tumor destruction, but may differ
  in completeness of tumor removal, recurrence rates, and procedure-related complications'
- 'Step 4: The evidence shows no statistically significant difference in all-cause
  mortality between surgery and radiofrequency ablation in eligible patients (HR 0.80,
  95% CI 0.60-1.08), suggesting comparable survival outcomes'

description: In patients with early or very early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma who
  are eligible for surgery, surgical resection compared to radiofrequency ablation
  shows no significant difference in all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up (29-42
  months). The hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% CI 0.60-1.08) suggests a trend toward lower
  mortality with surgery, but the confidence interval crosses 1.0, indicating no statistically
  significant difference between treatments.
