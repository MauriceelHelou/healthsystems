mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile health app provides patients with a dedicated chat function enabling
  direct asynchronous communication with their healthcare providers after hospital
  discharge'
- 'Step 2: Daily questionnaires within the app facilitate structured reporting of
  symptoms and recovery progress, creating regular touchpoints between patients and
  clinical team'
- 'Step 3: The combination of educational materials and accessible communication channels
  empowers patients to engage more effectively with their surgical team'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced communication accessibility reduces barriers to seeking guidance,
  with 88% of patients reporting improved ability to communicate with their surgeon'

description: Mobile health app use for postdischarge monitoring improves patient-provider
  communication quality through multiple integrated features including direct chat
  functionality, daily symptom questionnaires, and educational materials. In a prospective
  cohort study of colorectal surgery patients, 88% reported that the app improved
  their ability to communicate with their surgeon. This enhanced communication was
  associated with downstream benefits including fewer preventable emergency department
  visits (IRR 0.34, p=0.043) and shorter hospital length of stay.
