- 'Step 1: Proactive screening programs identify individuals with alcohol use disorder
  or history of alcohol excess in various settings (inpatient addiction services,
  outpatient addiction services, acute hospital admissions, community outreach)'
- 'Step 2: Targeted fibrosis assessment detects alcohol-related liver disease at earlier
  stages, with cirrhosis detection rates ranging from 1.2% to 29.6% depending on setting'
- 'Step 3: Early identification enables interventions including reduced alcohol intake,
  participation in hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, and disease management'
- 'Step 4: These interventions reduce progression to advanced liver disease and liver-related
  morbidity, ultimately decreasing liver disease mortality'

description: A systematic review of 15 studies demonstrates that proactive case finding
  for alcohol-related liver disease in high-risk populations can identify significant
  proportions of patients with fibrosis and cirrhosis at earlier stages. Early detection
  enables interventions that reduce alcohol intake and facilitate hepatocellular carcinoma
  surveillance, theoretically reducing liver-related morbidity and mortality. However,
  direct evidence on long-term mortality outcomes is still needed.
