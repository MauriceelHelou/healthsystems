direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Study champions provide structured in-person education to emergency department
  and hospitalist physicians about evidence-based outpatient PE management, the validated
  PE Severity Index risk stratification tool, and clinical decision support system
  (CDSS) availability'
- 'Step 2: Ongoing promotional activities including educational reviews, department-wide
  emails with monthly enrollment reports, comparison of CDSS use rates across sites,
  and recognition of physicians with high enrollment reinforce behavior change'
- 'Step 3: Weekly audit and feedback emails to individual physicians notify CDSS activators
  with thank-you notes and remind non-activators of missed opportunities and study
  objectives'
- 'Step 4: Small gift card incentives for first enrollments provide early motivation
  for behavior adoption'
- 'Step 5: Increased physician awareness, knowledge, and engagement with evidence-based
  risk stratification leads to greater identification of PE patients eligible for
  safe outpatient management rather than hospitalization'

description: A multicomponent intervention combining physician education, audit and
  feedback, early incentives, and clinical decision support system access increases
  the rate of outpatient management for emergency department patients with pulmonary
  embolism. Study champions provide structured education about evidence-based outpatient
  PE management and the PE Severity Index, while ongoing audit and feedback through
  weekly emails and monthly comparison reports reinforce behavior change among emergency
  physicians.
