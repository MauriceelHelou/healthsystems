mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intranasal esketamine is administered as a potential rapid-acting treatment
  for acute suicidal ideation in clinical settings'
- 'Step 2: Esketamine (S-enantiomer of ketamine) acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist,
  theoretically modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission'
- 'Step 3: Despite mechanistic rationale, large-scale randomized controlled trials
  demonstrate that intranasal esketamine does not significantly differ from placebo
  in reducing suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Large placebo effects observed in studies may mask or diminish any therapeutic
  signal from the active treatment'

description: Systematic review of 26 randomized controlled trials (12 with suicidal
  ideation reduction as primary objective, 14 as secondary) found that intranasal
  esketamine did not differ from placebo in large-scale studies for reducing suicidal
  ideation. This contrasts with intravenous racemic ketamine, which showed superiority
  to control conditions within the first 72 hours. The lack of efficacy for intranasal
  esketamine may relate to differences in bioavailability, the enantiomer-specific
  effects, or the substantial placebo response observed in these trials.
