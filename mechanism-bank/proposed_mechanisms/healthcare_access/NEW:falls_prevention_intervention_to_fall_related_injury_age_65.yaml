mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Falls prevention interventions are implemented targeting adults aged 65+
  years, including exercise programs, environmental modifications, medication review,
  vision correction, and multifactorial approaches'
- 'Step 2: These interventions address modifiable risk factors such as muscle weakness,
  balance impairment, hazardous home environments, polypharmacy, and visual deficits'
- 'Step 3: Improved physical function, safer environments, optimized medications,
  and better vision reduce the likelihood and severity of falls'
- 'Step 4: Reduced fall incidence and severity leads to fewer injurious falls, fractures,
  emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and physician visits due to falls among
  older adults'

description: Falls prevention interventions targeting older adults aged 65+ reduce
  fall-related injuries through multiple mechanisms including improved physical function
  (balance, strength), safer environments, optimized medication regimens, and corrected
  vision. The systematic review protocol identifies injurious falls and hospitalizations
  due to falls as primary outcomes, with secondary outcomes including fractures, emergency
  visits, and physician visits. Evidence suggests these interventions can effectively
  reduce the burden of fall-related morbidity in older populations.
