direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Colistin disrupts the outer membrane of multidrug-resistant gram-negative
  bacteria by binding to lipopolysaccharides, increasing bacterial cell permeability'
- 'Step 2: Meropenem, a carbapenem antibiotic, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis
  by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, providing broad-spectrum bactericidal
  activity'
- 'Step 3: The combination therapy produces synergistic antimicrobial effects against
  resistant pathogens causing nosocomial pneumonia, with colistin facilitating meropenem
  entry into bacterial cells'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced bacterial eradication leads to reduced inflammatory response,
  decreased organ dysfunction (lower SOFA scores), and improved clinical outcomes
  in hospitalized patients'

description: Colistin plus meropenem combination therapy significantly improves clinical
  outcomes in patients with nosocomial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative
  bacteria. The meta-analysis of 5 studies with 991 patients demonstrated that this
  combination therapy is superior to other colistin-based treatments, with an odds
  ratio of 1.37 for clinical improvement. The therapy also significantly reduced Sequential
  Organ Failure Assessment scores, indicating improved organ function.
