mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Injectable naltrexone is administered via long-acting intramuscular injection,
  ensuring sustained medication delivery and eliminating daily adherence requirements'
- 'Step 2: Naltrexone acts as an opioid receptor antagonist, blocking the rewarding
  effects of alcohol by inhibiting endorphin-mediated dopamine release in the brain''s
  reward pathway'
- 'Step 3: Reduced rewarding effects of alcohol diminish craving and decrease motivation
  to consume alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Sustained pharmacological blockade leads to fewer drinking days and reduced
  overall alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Reduced alcohol consumption improves clinical outcomes for individuals
  with alcohol use disorder'

description: Injectable naltrexone treatment reduces drinking days among individuals
  with alcohol use disorder. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 118 clinical
  trials (n=20,976) found that injectable naltrexone was associated with approximately
  5 fewer drinking days over a 30-day treatment period compared to placebo. The long-acting
  injectable formulation provides sustained opioid receptor blockade, reducing the
  rewarding effects of alcohol and decreasing alcohol consumption without requiring
  daily medication adherence.
