- 'Step 1: Deprescribing interventions systematically review and discontinue potentially
  inappropriate medications (PIMs) in older adults'
- 'Step 2: Reduction in polypharmacy decreases adverse drug events, drug-drug interactions,
  and medication-related falls'
- 'Step 3: Improved medication appropriateness leads to better overall health status
  and reduced hospitalizations'
- 'Step 4: Decreased medication burden and adverse events contributes to improved
  survival, particularly in frail older populations'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes evidence that deprescribing
  interventions—structured approaches to discontinuing potentially inappropriate medications—may
  improve survival in older adults. The effect is particularly pronounced in frail
  older populations. The mechanism operates through reducing polypharmacy-related
  harms including adverse drug events, drug interactions, falls, and hospitalizations,
  leading to improved health outcomes and reduced mortality.
