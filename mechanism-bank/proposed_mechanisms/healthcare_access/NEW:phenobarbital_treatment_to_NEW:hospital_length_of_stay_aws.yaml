direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use leads to downregulation of GABA receptors, causing
  benzodiazepine resistance in many patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome'
- 'Step 2: Phenobarbital acts on GABA-A receptors through a different binding site
  than benzodiazepines, providing effective symptom control even in benzodiazepine-resistant
  patients'
- 'Step 3: More effective withdrawal symptom management with phenobarbital leads to
  faster clinical stabilization and reduced need for escalating benzodiazepine doses'
- 'Step 4: Faster symptom resolution and clinical stability enables earlier hospital
  discharge, reducing overall hospital length of stay by approximately 2.6 days compared
  to benzodiazepine-only treatment'

description: 'Phenobarbital treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome is associated
  with a statistically significant reduction in hospital length of stay compared to
  benzodiazepine-only treatment. This meta-analysis found a mean difference of -2.6
  days (95% CI: -4.48 to -0.72, p=0.007) favoring phenobarbital. The mechanism involves
  phenobarbital''s ability to effectively manage withdrawal symptoms through GABA-A
  receptor modulation, particularly in patients who are resistant to benzodiazepines
  due to chronic alcohol-induced GABA receptor downregulation.'
