category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Health literacy interventions are delivered through various modalities
  (individual counseling, telephone-based, community worker-led, or nurse-led) to
  improve patients'' understanding of diabetes management'
- 'Step 2: Improved health literacy enhances diabetes knowledge and understanding
  of self-management requirements including medication adherence, dietary modifications,
  and physical activity'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced knowledge translates into improved self-management behaviors and
  self-care activities among T2DM patients'
- 'Step 4: Consistent engagement in self-management behaviors leads to better glycemic
  control as measured by reduced HbA1c levels'

description: Health literacy interventions targeting type 2 diabetes mellitus patients
  improve glycemic control (HbA1c levels) through enhanced diabetes knowledge and
  self-management behaviors. A systematic review of 15 RCTs found that health literacy-driven
  interventions consistently had positive impacts on both glycemic control and self-management
  outcomes, with effectiveness varying by intervention setting, delivery mode, provider
  type, and patient diabetes duration.
