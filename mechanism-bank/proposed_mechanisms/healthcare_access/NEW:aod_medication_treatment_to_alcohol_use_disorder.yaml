- 'Step 1: Individuals with alcohol use disorder receive pharmacologic treatment (e.g.,
  naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram) targeting neurobiological mechanisms of addiction'
- 'Step 2: AOD medications reduce cravings, block rewarding effects of alcohol, or
  create aversive reactions to alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Pharmacologic intervention leads to decreased alcohol consumption and reduced
  alcohol use severity at end of treatment'

description: Network meta-analysis of 24 RCTs found that AOD medication treatment
  significantly reduces alcohol use severity compared to placebo (SMD = -0.36). Effects
  were stronger when AOD medication was combined with trauma-focused psychotherapy
  (SMD = -0.50 vs placebo, SMD = -0.81 vs trauma-focused therapy + placebo), particularly
  in populations with comorbid PTSD.
