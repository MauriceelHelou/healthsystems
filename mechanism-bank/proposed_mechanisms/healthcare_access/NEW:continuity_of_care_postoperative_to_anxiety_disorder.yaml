- 'Step 1: Continuity of care programs provide comprehensive, continuous, and personalized
  care services extending beyond hospital discharge'
- 'Step 2: Extended care maintains patient-provider relationships and ensures consistent
  monitoring, education, and support during recovery'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing professional support and follow-up reduces uncertainty, improves
  patient knowledge about recovery expectations, and provides emotional support'
- 'Step 4: Reduced uncertainty and enhanced support mechanisms lead to decreased postoperative
  anxiety levels in patients'

description: Continuity of care for postoperative patients significantly reduces postoperative
  anxiety through the provision of comprehensive, continuous, and personalized care
  services. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials demonstrates that extended
  care programs that maintain patient-provider relationships and provide ongoing support
  during recovery lead to meaningful reductions in anxiety symptoms (SMD=-0.92).
