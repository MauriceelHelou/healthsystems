direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal syndrome treatment receive anti-seizure
  medications (ASMs) as therapeutic intervention'
- 'Step 2: ASMs produce adverse effects including sedation, dizziness, cognitive impairment,
  and other medication-specific side effects that patients find intolerable'
- 'Step 3: The burden of adverse events leads patients to discontinue treatment prematurely,
  with significantly higher dropout rates compared to placebo (OR: 1.86)'
- 'Step 4: Treatment dropout reduces exposure to complete AWS management protocols,
  potentially compromising recovery outcomes and continuity of care'

description: 'Anti-seizure medications used in alcohol withdrawal syndrome treatment
  are associated with significantly increased odds of treatment dropout due to adverse
  events compared to placebo. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 RCTs with
  2,223 participants found that ASMs led to 86% higher odds of dropout due to adverse
  events (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.05-3.28, p=0.034). This tolerability issue, combined
  with lack of demonstrated efficacy benefits, suggests ASMs may compromise treatment
  retention in AWS management.'

  description: Dropout due to adverse events was significantly higher when ASMs were
    compared to placebo specifically; comparison with benzodiazepines showed different
    patterns (increased rescue medication need rather than dropout)

  direction: weakens
  strength: weak
  description: Majority of included studies were conducted before 2000, which may
    limit generalizability to current clinical practice and newer ASM formulations
