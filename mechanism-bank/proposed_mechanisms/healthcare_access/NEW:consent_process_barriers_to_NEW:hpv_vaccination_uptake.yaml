direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: School-based HPV vaccination programs require parental/guardian consent
  before administration to adolescents'
- 'Step 2: Consent forms may not reach parents due to lost forms, language barriers,
  lack of understanding of the consent process, or administrative delays'
- 'Step 3: Parents who do not return consent forms (whether intentionally or unintentionally)
  result in their children being ineligible to receive vaccination during school-based
  sessions'
- 'Step 4: Missed school-based vaccination opportunities create barriers to catch-up
  vaccination, as alternative access points (GP, pharmacy) may be less convenient
  or unknown to families'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative consent process failures across the adolescent population contribute
  to reduced overall HPV vaccination coverage rates'

description: Challenges with obtaining consent for vaccination represent a key system-level
  barrier to HPV vaccination uptake in school-based programs. This systematic review
  of 24 UK publications identified consent process difficulties as one of several
  important barriers impacting vaccine coverage. When consent forms are not successfully
  completed and returned, adolescents miss vaccination opportunities during school-based
  sessions, contributing to coverage rates remaining below target levels and below
  pre-COVID rates.
