mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions (smartphone apps, text messaging, web-based platforms,
  telehealth services) provide accessible mental health support to IPV survivors who
  may face barriers to in-person care'
- 'Step 2: These platforms deliver evidence-based therapeutic content, online support
  groups, and trauma-informed care remotely, reducing isolation and providing coping
  strategies'
- 'Step 3: Increased access to mental health resources and reduced barriers to help-seeking
  leads to earlier intervention and treatment for trauma symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement with digital interventions results in clinical reductions
  in PTSD symptomatology among IPV survivors'

description: Digital and technology-based interventions for intimate partner violence,
  including mobile health platforms, smartphone apps, text messaging, web-based support
  groups, and telehealth services, are associated with clinical reductions in PTSD
  among IPV survivors. PTSD is 3-5 times higher among IPV victims compared to non-victims,
  making it a key target for intervention. Digital platforms overcome barriers to
  traditional care access, providing trauma-informed mental health support.
