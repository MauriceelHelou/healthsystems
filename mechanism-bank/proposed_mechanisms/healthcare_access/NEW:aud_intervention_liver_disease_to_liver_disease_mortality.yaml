mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with liver disease receive alcohol use disorder (AUD) intervention
  through integrated (colocated liver and addiction clinics) or concomitant (separate
  hepatology and addiction clinics) care models'
- 'Step 2: AUD intervention promotes alcohol abstinence (abstinence rate 0.41/person-year)
  and reduces alcohol relapse, decreasing ongoing hepatotoxic alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption prevents further liver damage, slowing progression
  of fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatic decompensation (44% lower odds of decompensation)'
- 'Step 4: Improved liver function and reduced decompensation events (59% lower 30-day
  readmission) leads to significantly reduced patient mortality (58% lower odds of
  death)'

description: Simultaneous management of alcohol use disorder in patients with liver
  disease significantly reduces mortality through improved abstinence rates, reduced
  alcohol relapse, decreased liver decompensation, and lower hospital readmission
  rates. The meta-analysis of 20 studies with 38,329 patients (7,072 receiving AUD
  intervention) demonstrates a 58% reduction in mortality odds with AUD intervention
  compared to standard care.
