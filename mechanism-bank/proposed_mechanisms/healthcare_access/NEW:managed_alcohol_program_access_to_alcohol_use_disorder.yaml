mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Managed alcohol programs provide controlled, regular doses of alcohol to
  individuals with severe alcohol dependence, typically in supervised settings'
- 'Step 2: Regular provision of measured alcohol doses reduces chaotic drinking patterns,
  binge drinking episodes, and consumption of non-beverage alcohol (e.g., mouthwash,
  hand sanitizer)'
- 'Step 3: Stabilized alcohol consumption decreases the cycle of intoxication and
  withdrawal that characterizes severe alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Program participation connects individuals to wraparound support services
  including healthcare, housing, and social support'
- 'Step 5: Overall alcohol consumption is reduced or stabilized, leading to decreased
  severity of alcohol use disorder symptoms and related harms'

description: Managed alcohol programs reduce or stabilize alcohol consumption among
  individuals with severe alcohol use disorder, particularly those who are homeless
  or vulnerably housed. By providing controlled doses of beverage-grade alcohol in
  supervised settings, these programs reduce chaotic drinking patterns, consumption
  of non-beverage alcohol, and connect participants to support services. This systematic
  review of reviews found that managed alcohol programs reduced or stabilized alcohol
  consumption, though high-quality evidence remains limited.
