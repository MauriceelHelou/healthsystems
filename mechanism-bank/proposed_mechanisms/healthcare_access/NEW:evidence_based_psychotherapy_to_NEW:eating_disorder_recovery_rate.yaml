direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with eating disorders (AN, BN, BED, OSFED) receive evidence-based
  psychotherapy treatments including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), family-based
  therapy (FBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), or psychodynamic therapy'
- 'Step 2: These therapies target core eating disorder pathology through specific
  mechanisms - CBT addresses maladaptive cognitions and behaviors around food/body
  image, FBT mobilizes family support for adolescent recovery, DBT builds emotion
  regulation skills, and psychodynamic therapy addresses underlying psychological
  conflicts'
- 'Step 3: Treatment engagement leads to symptom reduction in purging behaviors, binge
  eating, and normalization of body weight status'
- 'Step 4: Sustained therapeutic intervention over time results in measurable recovery
  outcomes, with recovery rates improving from 42% at <2 years to 67% at ≥10 years
  follow-up'

description: 'This comprehensive meta-analysis of 415 studies (N=88,372) demonstrates
  that evidence-based psychotherapies including CBT, FBT, DBT, and psychodynamic therapy
  are associated with higher recovery rates in eating disorders. Overall recovery
  occurred in 46% of patients, with rates improving over time. Specific treatment-outcome
  associations were identified: FBT, CBT, psychodynamic therapy, and nutritional interventions
  for AN; CBT, DBT, psychodynamic therapy, self-help, and nutritional/pharmacological
  treatments for BN; CBT, DBT, and nutritional/pharmacological interventions for BED;
  and CBT and psychodynamic therapy for OSFED. Notably, waiting list conditions were
  associated with higher mortality in AN, underscoring the importance of timely access
  to evidence-based treatment.'
