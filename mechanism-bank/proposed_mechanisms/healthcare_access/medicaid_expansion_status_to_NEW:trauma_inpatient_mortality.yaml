mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medicaid expansion increases health insurance coverage among previously
  uninsured trauma patients (OR 0.49 for being uninsured post-expansion)'
- 'Step 2: Increased insurance coverage improves access to post-acute care at discharge
  for trauma patients'
- 'Step 3: Despite improved coverage and access to post-acute care, meta-analysis
  shows no statistically significant change in inpatient mortality (OR 0.96, 95% CI
  0.88-1.05)'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 studies found that Medicaid
  expansion significantly reduced uninsured rates among trauma patients but did not
  show a statistically significant change in inpatient mortality. The confidence interval
  (0.88-1.05) crosses 1.0, indicating the effect is not distinguishable from no change.
  However, expansion did improve access to post-acute care, which may affect outcomes
  beyond the inpatient setting.
