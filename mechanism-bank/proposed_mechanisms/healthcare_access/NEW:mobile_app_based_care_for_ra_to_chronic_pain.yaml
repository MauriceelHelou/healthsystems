- 'Step 1: Mobile applications provide accessible, continuous disease monitoring and
  management tools for rheumatoid arthritis patients outside clinical settings'
- 'Step 2: Regular app-based interventions facilitate medication adherence, symptom
  tracking, and timely communication with healthcare providers'
- 'Step 3: Improved disease activity management through consistent monitoring leads
  to reduced inflammation and joint damage'
- 'Step 4: Reduced disease activity translates to decreased joint pain and overall
  chronic pain burden in RA patients'

  healthcare communication. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 RCTs involving
  3,175 patients demonstrated that mobile app interventions were effective in relieving
  disease activity, alleviating joint pain, and improving quality of life in RA patients.
