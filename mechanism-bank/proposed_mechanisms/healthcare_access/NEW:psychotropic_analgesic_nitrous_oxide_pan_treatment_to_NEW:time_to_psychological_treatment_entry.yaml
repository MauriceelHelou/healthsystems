category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PAN treatment is administered to patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal
  syndrome, providing rapid therapeutic effects on withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 2: PAN therapy requires minimal sedative medication compared to benzodiazepine
  regimens, reducing sedation duration and intensity'
- 'Step 3: Improved psychomotor function is achieved more quickly due to reduced sedative
  load (WMD -8.71 improvement in psychomotor function)'
- 'Step 4: Patients with less sedation and better psychomotor function are cognitively
  and physically prepared to engage in psychological treatment sooner'
- 'Step 5: Time to entry into psychological treatment phase is reduced, accelerating
  overall recovery trajectory'

description: Psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) treatment reduces time to
  psychological treatment entry in alcohol withdrawal patients by providing rapid
  symptom improvement while minimizing sedative medication requirements. The reduced
  sedation load preserves psychomotor function, enabling patients to be cognitively
  and physically ready to engage in psychological treatment more quickly than those
  receiving traditional benzodiazepine regimens.
