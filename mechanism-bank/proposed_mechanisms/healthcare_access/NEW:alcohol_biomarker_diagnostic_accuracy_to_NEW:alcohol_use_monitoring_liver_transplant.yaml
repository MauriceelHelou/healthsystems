direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is a major indication for liver transplantation,
  requiring reliable methods to monitor alcohol use during transplant evaluation'
- 'Step 2: Validated biomarkers with high diagnostic accuracy (urinary EtG sensitivity
  70-89%, specificity 93-99%; hair EtG sensitivity 85-100%, specificity 97-100%; PEth
  sensitivity 73-100%, specificity 90-96%) enable objective detection of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Different biomarkers provide complementary detection windows (urinary EtG:
  days; PEth: weeks; hair EtG: 3-6 months), allowing comprehensive monitoring throughout
  transplant evaluation periods'
- 'Step 4: Accurate biomarker testing improves transplant program ability to objectively
  assess patient sobriety, enhancing clinical decision-making for transplant candidacy'
- 'Step 5: Objective monitoring facilitates access to transplantation for patients
  who can demonstrate sustained abstinence through validated testing'

description: High diagnostic accuracy of alcohol biomarkers in liver disease patients
  enables reliable objective monitoring of alcohol use during liver transplant evaluation.
  Urinary EtG, hair EtG, and PEth show good to excellent sensitivity and specificity
  in detecting alcohol use across different time windows, supporting transplant programs'
  ability to assess candidate sobriety and make informed listing decisions.
