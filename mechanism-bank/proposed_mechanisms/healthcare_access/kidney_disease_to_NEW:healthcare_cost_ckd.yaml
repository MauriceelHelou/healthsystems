mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CKD progression leads to declining kidney function (measured by eGFR) and
  increasing albuminuria severity'
- 'Step 2: Disease progression requires more frequent physician visits, laboratory
  monitoring, and specialist consultations'
- 'Step 3: Complications develop requiring hospitalizations, emergency department
  visits, and outpatient procedures'
- 'Step 4: Advanced CKD (eGFR<15) requires dialysis initiation, dramatically increasing
  kidney care costs to 32.3% of total costs'
- 'Step 5: Cardiovascular complications common in CKD patients add additional healthcare
  utilization and costs'
- 'Step 6: Cumulative healthcare costs show graded association with CKD severity,
  with mean costs exceeding twice national average'

description: Chronic kidney disease imposes substantial healthcare costs through a
  graded relationship with disease severity. In a population-based cohort of 219,641
  adults with CKD in Alberta, Canada, mean 1-year healthcare costs were Can$14,634
  per patient (more than twice the average per-person healthcare cost in Canada).
  Costs increased dramatically with declining kidney function, with kidney care costs
  rising from 1.6% of total costs overall to 32.3% for patients with eGFR<15. Healthcare
  utilization spans drugs, physician visits, emergency department visits, outpatient
  procedures including dialysis, and hospitalizations.
