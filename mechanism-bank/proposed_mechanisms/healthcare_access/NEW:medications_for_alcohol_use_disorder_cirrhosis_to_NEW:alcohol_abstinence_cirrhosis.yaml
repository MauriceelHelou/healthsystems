direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis and alcohol use disorder are
  prescribed medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) including baclofen, metadoxine,
  acamprosate, or fecal microbiota transplant'
- 'Step 2: These medications act through various pharmacological mechanisms to reduce
  alcohol cravings, withdrawal symptoms, and reward pathways associated with alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced cravings and improved neurobiological support lead to decreased
  alcohol consumption and increased rates of sustained alcohol abstinence'
- 'Step 4: MAUD treatment increases alcohol abstinence rates by 32% compared to placebo
  or standard treatment in cirrhosis patients'

description: 'Medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) significantly promote alcohol
  abstinence in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis. A systematic review and
  meta-analysis of 8 studies (794 patients) found that MAUD treatment reduces the
  relative risk of alcohol consumption by 32% (RR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.48-0.97) compared
  to placebo or standard treatment. The medications studied included baclofen, metadoxine,
  acamprosate, and fecal microbiota transplant, with a good safety profile (only 3%
  of serious adverse events possibly/probably related to study medications).'
