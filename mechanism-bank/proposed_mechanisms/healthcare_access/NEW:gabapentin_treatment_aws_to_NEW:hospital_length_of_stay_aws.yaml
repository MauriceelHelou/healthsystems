direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentin is administered to hospitalized patients experiencing acute
  alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS), often as adjunctive therapy to benzodiazepines'
- 'Step 2: Gabapentin''s antiepileptic mechanism of action modulates GABA and glutamate
  systems, potentially accelerating resolution of withdrawal symptoms particularly
  in severe AWS cases'
- 'Step 3: Faster symptom resolution and reduced need for additional benzodiazepines
  may enable earlier medical stabilization'
- 'Step 4: In specific subgroups (severe AWS patients and those receiving gabapentin
  without benzodiazepines), this leads to significantly decreased hospital length
  of stay'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 retrospective studies (n=2030)
  found no significant overall difference in hospital length of stay between gabapentin-treated
  and benzodiazepine-treated patients with acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However,
  subgroup analyses revealed significant LOS reductions in gabapentin-treated patients
  among severe AWS cases (p=0.04) and those receiving gabapentin without benzodiazepines
  (p<0.001). These subgroup findings were based on limited studies (1-2 studies each).
