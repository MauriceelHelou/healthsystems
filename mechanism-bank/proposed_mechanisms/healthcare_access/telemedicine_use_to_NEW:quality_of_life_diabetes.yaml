mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telemedicine interventions provide remote access to diabetes care providers,
  enabling more frequent monitoring and communication between patients and healthcare
  teams'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced monitoring facilitates timely medication dose adjustments and
  personalized diabetes management guidance, improving glycemic control (HbA1c reduction
  of 0.22%)'
- 'Step 3: Improved glycemic control reduces diabetes-related symptoms, complications,
  and daily disease burden'
- 'Step 4: Reduced disease burden and better diabetes management translate to improved
  overall quality of life as measured by non-youth-specific instruments'

description: Meta-analysis of 20 RCTs (n=1704) demonstrates that telemedicine interventions
  significantly improve non-youth-specific quality of life in children and adolescents
  with Type 1 diabetes mellitus compared to usual care. The improvement in quality
  of life appears to be mediated through better glycemic control achieved via enhanced
  remote monitoring, more frequent provider communication, and timely treatment adjustments.
  Notably, while youth-specific diabetes quality of life scores showed no significant
  improvement, general quality of life measures demonstrated statistically significant
  benefits with no heterogeneity across studies.
