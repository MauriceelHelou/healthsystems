mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative reforms expand the legal grounds on which abortion can be performed,
  shifting from highly restrictive to relatively liberal legal frameworks'
- 'Step 2: Expanded legal grounds enable healthcare facilities to offer abortion services
  without legal risk, increasing the number of providers and service points'
- 'Step 3: Legal protection for both providers and patients reduces fear of prosecution,
  encouraging women to seek formal healthcare services rather than clandestine alternatives'
- 'Step 4: Health systems can implement standardized protocols, training programs,
  and quality assurance measures for legal abortion services'
- 'Step 5: Increased availability and accessibility of formal abortion services leads
  to higher utilization rates among women seeking pregnancy termination'

description: Systematic review of 13 studies across 8 LMICs demonstrates that legislative
  reforms expanding abortion access from highly restrictive to relatively liberal
  frameworks are associated with increased use of and access to abortion services.
  The review employed multiple quasi-experimental designs including interrupted time
  series, difference-in-differences, and synthetic control methods to establish causal
  effects. Downstream effects include reduced fertility rates (particularly among
  women 20-34 years) and lower maternal mortality, suggesting improved service utilization
  translates to health benefits.
