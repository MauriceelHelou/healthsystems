mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing First intervention provides rapid access to permanent, non-abstinence-contingent
  housing for homeless or at-risk individuals'
- 'Step 2: Stable housing reduces exposure to environmental health hazards, violence,
  and conditions that exacerbate chronic health problems'
- 'Step 3: Housing stability enables more consistent access to primary care and routine
  health services, reducing need for crisis intervention'
- 'Step 4: Decreased exposure to acute stressors and improved ability to manage chronic
  conditions leads to fewer health emergencies'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in emergency department visits as acute health crises become
  less frequent due to improved living conditions and healthcare access'

description: Housing First interventions significantly reduce emergency department
  visits among homeless or at-risk populations. A meta-analysis of 4 RCTs found that
  intervention groups experienced 37% fewer ED visits (IRR=0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.82)
  compared to control groups. This reduction occurs through improved housing stability,
  which enables better management of chronic conditions and reduces acute health crises
  that would otherwise require emergency care.
