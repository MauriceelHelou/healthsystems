mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ACT model provides intensive, community-based outreach that brings treatment
  directly to patients with SUD in their living environments, reducing barriers to
  accessing care'
- 'Step 2: Multidisciplinary ACT teams address substantial medical and social needs
  simultaneously, integrating SUD-specific treatments into comprehensive care coordination'
- 'Step 3: Persistent assertive outreach maintains contact with difficult-to-engage
  patients, increasing frequency and consistency of service contacts compared to traditional
  outpatient programs'
- 'Step 4: Higher service contact rates translate to improved treatment engagement,
  with 4 out of 5 datasets in systematic review showing higher treatment engagement
  for ACT versus control conditions'

description: Assertive Community Treatment enrollment improves treatment engagement
  for patients with substance use disorders by providing intensive community-based
  outreach that overcomes barriers to traditional outpatient care. This systematic
  review of 5 randomized controlled datasets found that 4 out of 5 showed higher treatment
  engagement for ACT compared to control conditions, with one dataset specifically
  reporting higher service contact rates for ACT participants.
