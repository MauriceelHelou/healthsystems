- 'Step 1: Neonatal mortality risk is highest in the first 24 hours (38.8% of deaths)
  and first week (71.7% of deaths), with different causes predominating at different
  times'
- 'Step 2: Early postnatal care visits (particularly within first 24-48 hours) enable
  detection and management of birth asphyxia, which causes 68.1% of day-1 deaths'
- 'Step 3: Postnatal visits during days 2-7 allow identification and treatment of
  severe infections, responsible for 48.1% of deaths in this period'
- 'Step 4: Later postnatal visits (days 8-28) enable prevention and management of
  diarrheal diseases, which account for 62.7% of late neonatal deaths'
- 'Step 5: Appropriately timed postnatal care visits aligned with cause-specific mortality
  patterns reduce overall neonatal mortality by addressing threats at their peak occurrence'

description: Systematic review of 51 studies with over 6.7 million live births demonstrates
  that neonatal mortality is concentrated in the early postnatal period, with 39.5%
  of deaths on day 1 and 71.7% in the first week. Cause-specific patterns show birth
  asphyxia dominates day-1 deaths, severe infections peak during days 2-7, and diarrheal
  diseases cause most deaths in days 8-28. This evidence establishes that appropriately
  timed postnatal care visits - particularly early visits within the first 24-48 hours
  and first week - can reduce neonatal mortality by enabling timely detection and
  management of the predominant causes at each time point.
