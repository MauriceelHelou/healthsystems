mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Co-designed mental health interventions incorporate input from people experiencing
  homelessness (PEH) in the design and delivery of primary care services, increasing
  relevance and acceptability of services'
- 'Step 2: User participation in service design reduces barriers to care including
  stigma, distrust, and cultural misalignment that typically deter PEH from seeking
  primary care'
- 'Step 3: Improved mental health outcomes and therapeutic relationships established
  through co-designed interventions foster continued engagement with primary care
  services'
- 'Step 4: As PEH develop ongoing relationships with primary care providers, they
  shift utilization patterns away from emergency services toward more appropriate
  and consistent primary care utilization'

description: Co-designed mental health interventions in primary care settings increase
  primary care utilization among people experiencing homelessness by creating services
  that are more acceptable, accessible, and responsive to user needs. The participatory
  design process reduces traditional barriers to care and builds trust, leading to
  sustained engagement with primary care while reducing reliance on emergency services.
