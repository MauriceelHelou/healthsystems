mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SSRIs are prescribed to patients with comorbid alcohol use disorder and
  depressive disorders as adjunctive treatment to usual care'
- 'Step 2: SSRIs modulate serotonergic neurotransmission, which may address shared
  neurobiological pathways underlying both depression and alcohol craving/consumption'
- 'Step 3: Improved functional status and potential reduction in depressive symptoms
  may decrease self-medication with alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Treatment results in slight reduction in alcohol use, though effect is
  modest and confidence in the evidence is low'

description: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of 36 RCTs found that SSRIs
  may result in a slight reduction of alcohol use in adults with comorbid alcohol
  use disorder and depressive disorders compared to placebo (SMD = -0.30). SSRIs also
  demonstrated greater benefit for functional status. However, confidence in the alcohol
  use reduction effect is low, and SSRIs were associated with increased risk of adverse
  events.
