mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acamprosate is prescribed as pharmacotherapy for patients with alcohol
  use disorder, typically in conjunction with psychosocial interventions'
- 'Step 2: Acamprosate modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission and restores the
  balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems disrupted by
  chronic alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: This neurobiological stabilization reduces alcohol craving and the negative
  affective states associated with protracted abstinence'
- 'Step 4: Patients receiving acamprosate treatment demonstrate significantly higher
  rates of maintaining abstinence (NNT=11 to prevent one person from returning to
  any drinking)'
- 'Step 5: Sustained abstinence and reduced drinking leads to improved alcohol use
  disorder outcomes and reduced severity of the condition'

description: Acamprosate treatment significantly reduces the likelihood of returning
  to any drinking in patients with alcohol use disorder. A comprehensive meta-analysis
  of 118 clinical trials with 20,976 participants found that acamprosate has a number
  needed to treat of 11 to prevent one person from returning to any drinking, supporting
  its use as a first-line pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder when combined with
  psychosocial interventions.
