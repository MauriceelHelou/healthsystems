mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-dose gabapentin (≥1200mg/day) is administered to patients hospitalized
  with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS)'
- 'Step 2: Gabapentin modulates calcium channels and enhances GABAergic neurotransmission,
  providing anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects that address core AWS pathophysiology'
- 'Step 3: The GABAergic effects of gabapentin partially substitute for the sedative-hypnotic
  action typically provided by benzodiazepines in AWS management'
- 'Step 4: Patients receiving high-dose gabapentin demonstrate reduced severity of
  alcohol withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, tremor, and autonomic instability'
- 'Step 5: The reduction in withdrawal symptom severity translates to decreased need
  for as-needed (PRN) benzodiazepine dosing and lower total benzodiazepine requirements
  during hospitalization'

description: High-dose gabapentin treatment reduces benzodiazepine requirements in
  patients hospitalized with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Gabapentin's GABAergic
  and calcium channel modulating properties address withdrawal pathophysiology, decreasing
  symptom severity and the need for benzodiazepine-based symptom management. This
  represents a benzodiazepine-sparing approach that may reduce risks associated with
  high-dose benzodiazepine use including respiratory depression and prolonged sedation.
