direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PAN treatment is administered to patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal
  states as an alternative to benzodiazepine regimens'
- 'Step 2: PAN exerts rapid psychotropic and analgesic effects that directly address
  withdrawal symptoms including anxiety and agitation'
- 'Step 3: The therapeutic effects of PAN reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms
  more rapidly than traditional sedative approaches'
- 'Step 4: Reduced symptom severity decreases the clinical need for sedative medications
  to manage withdrawal'
- 'Step 5: Both the amount and duration of sedative medication requirements are decreased
  compared to standard treatment protocols'

description: Psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) treatment reduces sedative
  medication requirements in patients with alcohol withdrawal states. A Cochrane systematic
  review of 5 RCTs with 212 participants found that PAN treatment was associated with
  improvements in withdrawal symptoms and significant reductions in both the amount
  and duration of sedative medication needed. The rapid therapeutic effect of PAN
  therapy coupled with minimal sedative requirements may enable patients to enter
  psychological treatment phases more quickly, potentially accelerating recovery.
