direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Enhanced patient-provider communication channels (e.g., mobile app chat
  functions) provide patients with direct access to their surgical care team during
  the post-discharge recovery period'
- 'Step 2: Patients can communicate concerns, symptoms, and questions directly to
  providers without needing to visit emergency departments for reassurance or guidance'
- 'Step 3: Providers can assess patient-reported symptoms remotely through daily questionnaires
  and direct messaging, enabling timely triage and intervention'
- 'Step 4: Many post-surgical concerns that would otherwise drive ED visits (anxiety
  about symptoms, uncertainty about recovery progress) are resolved through remote
  communication'
- 'Step 5: Preventable ED visits are reduced as patients receive appropriate reassurance,
  guidance, or directed outpatient care rather than defaulting to emergency services'

description: Improved patient-provider communication through mobile health technology
  enables post-surgical patients to access their care team directly, allowing remote
  assessment of concerns and symptoms. This reduces preventable emergency department
  visits by addressing patient anxieties and clinical questions through alternative
  channels, with a 66% reduction in preventable ED visits observed (IRR 0.34).
