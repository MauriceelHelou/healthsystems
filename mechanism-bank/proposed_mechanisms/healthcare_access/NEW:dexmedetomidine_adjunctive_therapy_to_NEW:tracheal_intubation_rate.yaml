mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dexmedetomidine is administered as adjunctive therapy alongside standard
  benzodiazepine treatment for alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS)'
- 'Step 2: Dexmedetomidine provides sedation and controls autonomic hyperactivity
  without causing respiratory depression, unlike benzodiazepines'
- 'Step 3: The absence of respiratory depression theoretically reduces the need for
  airway protection and mechanical ventilation'
- 'Step 4: Reduced respiratory compromise may decrease the clinical indication for
  tracheal intubation in AWS patients'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 studies examined whether
  dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapy reduces tracheal intubation rates in patients
  with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The meta-analysis found a non-statistically significant
  trend toward reduced intubation (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.25-1.3), suggesting dexmedetomidine
  may reduce intubation risk by approximately 43%, though the confidence interval
  includes null effect. The theoretical mechanism is that dexmedetomidine provides
  sedation without respiratory depression, potentially reducing the need for airway
  protection.'
