- 'Step 1: In-house virtual surgical planning (VSP) workflows eliminate vendor fees
  and outsourcing costs associated with third-party VSP services'
- 'Step 2: In-house VSP enables faster turnaround times and greater flexibility in
  surgical planning, reducing delays and associated costs'
- 'Step 3: Optimized surgical planning leads to reduced operating room (OR) times
  through more precise pre-operative preparation'
- 'Step 4: Decreased OR times result in lower direct surgical costs (anesthesia, staffing,
  equipment utilization)'
- 'Step 5: Improved surgical precision and planning contribute to reduced length of
  stay (LOS) and length of hospitalization (LOH)'
- 'Step 6: Cumulative cost savings from reduced OR time, LOS, and elimination of outsourcing
  fees generate overall surgical cost savings'

description: A systematic review of 18 studies (n=733 patients) found that in-house
  virtual surgical planning workflows generate greater cost savings compared to outsourced
  VSP in head and neck reconstruction. Seventy-eight percent (14/18) of studies found
  VSP either generated cost savings or was comparable to traditional freehand surgery.
  The primary mechanisms for cost savings include reduced operating room times, decreased
  length of stay/hospitalization, and elimination of third-party vendor fees associated
  with outsourcing.
