- 'Step 1: Homeless individuals with alcohol use engage with substance treatment services
  as initial point of healthcare contact'
- 'Step 2: Substance treatment services serve as a ''gateway'' connecting individuals
  to integrated care networks and referral systems'
- 'Step 3: Through substance treatment engagement, individuals gain access to psychiatric
  services via coordinated care pathways'
- 'Step 4: Psychiatric services subsequently provide a secondary gateway to medical
  services, creating a cascading service connection effect'
