mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with mental health problems (depression, personality disorders,
  suicidal ideation) engage in psychotherapy, either directly targeting suicidal thoughts/behaviors
  or indirectly addressing underlying conditions'
- 'Step 2: Psychotherapy provides cognitive and behavioral skills including emotion
  regulation, distress tolerance, problem-solving, and challenging maladaptive thought
  patterns'
- 'Step 3: Both direct interventions (targeting suicide specifically) and indirect
  interventions (treating underlying mental health conditions) reduce psychological
  distress and hopelessness'
- 'Step 4: Reduced psychological distress, improved coping mechanisms, and treatment
  of underlying conditions decrease the likelihood of suicide attempts'

description: A comprehensive meta-analysis of 147 randomized clinical trials with
  11,001 participants demonstrates that psychotherapy, whether directly targeting
  suicidal thoughts and behaviors or indirectly addressing underlying mental health
  conditions, significantly reduces the incidence of suicide attempts. Direct psychotherapy
  showed a 28% reduction in suicide attempts (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62-0.84), while indirect
  psychotherapy showed a 32% reduction (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.95). This suggests
  that expanding access to mental health treatment broadly, not just suicide-specific
  interventions, can effectively reduce suicide attempts.

    0.68) showed similar effect sizes for reducing suicide attempts, suggesting treatment
    approach does not substantially moderate effectiveness
