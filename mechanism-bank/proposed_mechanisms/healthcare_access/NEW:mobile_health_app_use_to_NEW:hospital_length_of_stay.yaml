mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile health apps provide patient education materials and daily postdischarge
  questionnaires that enhance patient understanding of recovery expectations and warning
  signs'
- 'Step 2: Real-time patient-provider chat functionality enables continuous monitoring
  and early identification of recovery concerns without requiring in-person visits'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced communication reduces patient anxiety about discharge timing,
  allowing clinicians to confidently discharge patients earlier knowing remote monitoring
  is available'
- 'Step 4: Early identification and management of postdischarge concerns prevents
  complications that would otherwise require extended hospitalization or readmission'
- 'Step 5: The combination of patient empowerment through education and accessible
  provider communication reduces average hospital length of stay'

description: Mobile health app use for postdischarge monitoring is associated with
  a 1.62-day reduction in hospital length of stay after major elective colorectal
  surgery. The app comprised patient education material, daily questionnaires assessing
  postdischarge recovery, and patient-provider chat function. Enhanced postdischarge
  monitoring and patient-provider communication likely enable earlier discharge decisions
  by providing clinicians confidence in remote patient monitoring capabilities.
