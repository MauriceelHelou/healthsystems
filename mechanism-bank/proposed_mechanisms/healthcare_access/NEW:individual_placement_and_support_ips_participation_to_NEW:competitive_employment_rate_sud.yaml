direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IPS program applies zero exclusion policy, ensuring individuals with SUD
  are not screened out of employment services regardless of symptom severity, treatment
  adherence, or job readiness'
- 'Step 2: Rapid competitive job search approach places participants directly into
  competitive employment rather than prevocational training, reducing time to employment'
- 'Step 3: IPS integrates employment services with substance abuse treatment services,
  allowing coordinated support addressing both recovery and employment goals simultaneously'
- 'Step 4: Ongoing benefits counseling helps participants understand how employment
  affects disability benefits, reducing fear of losing income support'
- 'Step 5: Continuous job support during and after placement addresses barriers specific
  to SUD population including episodic treatment needs, relapse risk, and housing/criminal
  justice instability'
- 'Step 6: Integration with treatment helps participants maintain recovery while navigating
  workplace demands, leading to sustained competitive employment'

  rapid job search, integration with treatment services, and ongoing support. The
  systematic review found high evidence supporting application of IPS for persons
  with SUD, both alone and when combined with mental health disorders.
