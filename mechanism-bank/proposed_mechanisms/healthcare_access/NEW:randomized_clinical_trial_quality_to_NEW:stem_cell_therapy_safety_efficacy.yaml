mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with proper design elements (large sample
  sizes, control groups, systematic documentation of adverse effects and failures)
  establish the gold standard for evaluating stem cell therapies'
- 'Step 2: Regulatory monitoring and oversight systems ensure that stem cell clinical
  research activities are conducted with sufficient preclinical data and follow established
  protocols'
- 'Step 3: The iterative exchange between bench research and bedside clinical application,
  facilitated by RCT frameworks, enables identification of safety signals and efficacy
  outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Government research hospitals conducting RCTs (37 studies identified) contribute
  to the evidence base that distinguishes safe and effective stem cell applications
  from those with unfavorable risk-benefit profiles'
- 'Step 5: Higher quality RCT evidence informs clinical guidelines and regulatory
  decisions, ultimately improving the safety profile and demonstrated efficacy of
  stem cell therapies reaching patients'

description: This systematic review of 61 stem cell therapy studies in India (2001-2021)
  demonstrates that maintaining gold standard quality in stem cell therapy requires
  randomized clinical trials with rigorous design elements including large sample
  sizes, control groups, and systematic documentation of failures and adverse effects.
  The study emphasizes that robust monitoring and regulation systems in stem cell
  clinical research, combined with sufficient preclinical data and iterative bench-to-bedside
  exchanges, are essential for establishing stem cell therapy safety and efficacy.
