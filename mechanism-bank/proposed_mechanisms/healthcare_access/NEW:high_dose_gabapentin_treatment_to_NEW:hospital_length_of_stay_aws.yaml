mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-dose gabapentin (≥1800mg/day) is administered as adjunctive therapy
  to patients hospitalized with severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS)'
- 'Step 2: Gabapentin modulates GABAergic neurotransmission and reduces glutamatergic
  hyperexcitability, addressing the neurobiological imbalance underlying AWS symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Improved symptom control reduces the severity and duration of withdrawal
  symptoms including anxiety, tremor, and autonomic instability'
- 'Step 4: Reduced symptom burden decreases the need for high-dose benzodiazepine
  therapy, which can cause sedation and prolonged recovery'
- 'Step 5: Faster stabilization of AWS symptoms and reduced sedation from lower benzodiazepine
  requirements enables earlier medical clearance and hospital discharge'

description: High-dose gabapentin treatment for severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome
  reduces hospital length of stay through improved symptom control and reduced benzodiazepine
  requirements. By addressing the GABAergic and glutamatergic dysregulation underlying
  AWS, gabapentin facilitates faster symptom resolution and clinical stabilization,
  enabling earlier safe discharge.
