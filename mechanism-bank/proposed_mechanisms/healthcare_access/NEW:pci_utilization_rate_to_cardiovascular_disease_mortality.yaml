mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher PCI utilization rates increase access to timely revascularization
  procedures for patients experiencing acute coronary syndromes and myocardial infarction'
- 'Step 2: Timely PCI restores blood flow to ischemic myocardium, reducing infarct
  size and preserving cardiac function'
- 'Step 3: Improved myocardial salvage and reduced complications (heart failure, arrhythmias)
  lead to better short-term survival outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular events following successful
  PCI translate to reduced cardiovascular disease mortality at the population level'

description: Higher percutaneous coronary intervention utilization rates are associated
  with reduced cardiovascular disease mortality through improved access to timely
  revascularization. This systematic review of 10 studies found that populations with
  lower PCI utilization rates, particularly African American and Hispanic elderly
  patients, experienced worse clinical outcomes including higher mortality rates and
  increased major adverse cardiovascular events. The relationship is mediated by door-to-balloon
  time and access to care, with Medicaid expansion demonstrating ability to reduce
  disparities.
