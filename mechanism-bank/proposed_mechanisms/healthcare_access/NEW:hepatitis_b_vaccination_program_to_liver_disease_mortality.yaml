- 'Step 1: National hepatitis B vaccination programs are implemented, targeting newborns
  and high-risk populations'
- 'Step 2: Vaccination prevents hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection by inducing protective
  antibodies'
- 'Step 3: Reduced HBV infection rates decrease the prevalence of chronic hepatitis
  B in the population'
- 'Step 4: Lower chronic hepatitis B prevalence results in fewer cases of liver cirrhosis
  development'
- 'Step 5: Decreased liver cirrhosis incidence leads to reduced liver disease mortality
  rates over time'

description: National hepatitis B vaccination programs reduce liver disease mortality
  by preventing chronic HBV infection, which is a major cause of liver cirrhosis.
  In Iran, a temporal pattern of increasing then decreasing cirrhosis mortality (peaking
  around 2002, then declining through 2015) was attributed to the national hepatitis
  B vaccination program. Hepatitis B and C account for over 60% of liver cirrhosis
  deaths, with hepatitis B contributing four times more mortality than hepatitis C.
