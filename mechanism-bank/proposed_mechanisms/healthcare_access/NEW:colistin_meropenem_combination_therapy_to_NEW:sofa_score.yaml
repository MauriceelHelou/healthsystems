mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Administration of colistin plus meropenem combination therapy provides
  synergistic antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria
  causing nosocomial pneumonia'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced bacterial killing through dual mechanisms - colistin disrupts
  bacterial cell membranes while meropenem inhibits cell wall synthesis, leading to
  more effective pathogen eradication'
- 'Step 3: Reduced bacterial load decreases systemic inflammatory response and prevents
  progression of sepsis-related organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Improved infection control leads to stabilization and recovery of affected
  organ systems, resulting in lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores
  indicating reduced multi-organ dysfunction'

description: 'Colistin plus meropenem combination therapy significantly reduces Sequential
  Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores in patients with nosocomial pneumonia compared
  to other colistin-based treatments. This meta-analysis of 5 studies involving 991
  patients demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SOFA scores (OR =
  -0.28, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.11, p = 0.001), indicating improved organ function with
  the combination therapy.'
