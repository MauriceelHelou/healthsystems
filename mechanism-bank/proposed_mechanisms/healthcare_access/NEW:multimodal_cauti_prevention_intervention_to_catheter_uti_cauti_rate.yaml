category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CDC-funded STRIVE initiative implements multimodal hospital-level intervention
  targeting hospitals with elevated HAI rates using the Targeted Assessment for Prevention
  (TAP) strategy'
- 'Step 2: Hospitals complete ICAR/PCA self-assessment tools to identify gaps in infection
  prevention and control (IPC) practices specific to CAUTI prevention'
- 'Step 3: Web-based education modules provide training on foundational infection
  control (hand hygiene, personal protective equipment), catheter insertion/maintenance
  protocols, and appropriate catheter use criteria'
- 'Step 4: State-level partners (hospital associations, health departments) provide
  external facilitation, technical assistance, and coaching to support implementation'
- 'Step 5: Culture change strategies address staff engagement, competency-based training,
  audits, and feedback mechanisms to sustain prevention practices'
- 'Step 6: Improved implementation of evidence-based bladder bundle interventions,
  aseptic insertion techniques, and reduced inappropriate catheter utilization leads
  to decreased CAUTI rates'

description: The CDC STRIVE initiative is a multimodal, externally-facilitated quality
  improvement intervention that reduces CAUTI rates through comprehensive infection
  prevention strategies. The intervention combines self-assessment tools, web-based
  education, state-level external facilitation, and culture change strategies to improve
  implementation of evidence-based catheter care practices. Meta-analytic evidence
  from multifaceted interventions shows a pooled CAUTI incidence rate ratio of 0.54
  (46% reduction) compared to standard care.
