mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Evidence-based psychotherapies (CBT, FBT, DBT) are delivered to individuals
  with eating disorders through structured treatment protocols targeting core symptoms'
- 'Step 2: These therapies address maladaptive cognitions, family dynamics, and emotional
  dysregulation that maintain disordered eating behaviors'
- 'Step 3: CBT targets cognitive distortions about food, weight, and body image while
  building behavioral skills for normalized eating patterns'
- 'Step 4: Family-based therapy (FBT) mobilizes family support and parental involvement
  in re-establishing healthy eating, particularly effective in adolescents'
- 'Step 5: DBT addresses emotional regulation deficits and distress tolerance, reducing
  binge-purge cycles and self-injurious behaviors'
- 'Step 6: Treatment engagement leads to symptom reduction, normalized eating behaviors,
  and psychological improvements resulting in higher recovery rates'

description: 'A comprehensive meta-analysis of 415 studies (N=88,372) demonstrates
  that evidence-based psychotherapies including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT),
  family-based therapy (FBT), and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) are associated
  with higher recovery rates across eating disorder diagnoses. Overall recovery occurred
  in 46% of patients. Specific treatment associations with higher recovery were identified:
  FBT, CBT, and psychodynamic therapy for anorexia nervosa; CBT, DBT, and self-help
  for bulimia nervosa; CBT and DBT for binge eating disorder. Notably, pharmacological
  treatment alone in anorexia nervosa was associated with lower recovery, and waiting
  list conditions were associated with higher mortality, underscoring the importance
  of active psychotherapeutic intervention.'
