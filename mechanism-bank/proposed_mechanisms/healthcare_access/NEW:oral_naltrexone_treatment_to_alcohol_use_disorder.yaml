mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oral naltrexone (50mg/d) is prescribed as pharmacotherapy for patients
  with alcohol use disorder, typically in conjunction with psychosocial interventions'
- 'Step 2: Naltrexone acts as an opioid receptor antagonist, blocking the mu-opioid
  receptors in the brain''s reward system'
- 'Step 3: By blocking opioid receptors, naltrexone reduces the pleasurable effects
  and reinforcing properties of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced reward response decreases craving and motivation to drink, leading
  to lower rates of return to any drinking (NNT=18) and return to heavy drinking (NNT=11)'
- 'Step 5: Sustained treatment adherence results in reduced alcohol consumption and
  improved management of alcohol use disorder'

description: Oral naltrexone at 50mg/d is an effective first-line pharmacotherapy
  for alcohol use disorder. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 118 clinical
  trials with 20,976 participants found that oral naltrexone significantly reduces
  return to any drinking (NNT=18) and return to heavy drinking (NNT=11) compared to
  placebo. The medication works by blocking opioid receptors, thereby reducing the
  rewarding effects of alcohol. Treatment is most effective when combined with psychosocial
  interventions.
