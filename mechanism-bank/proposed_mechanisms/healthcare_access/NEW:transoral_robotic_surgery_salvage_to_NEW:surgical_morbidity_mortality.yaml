mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) provides a minimally invasive approach
  for salvage treatment of recurrent, residual, or second primary head and neck cancers
  in previously irradiated fields'
- 'Step 2: The robotic approach avoids the extensive tissue dissection and reconstruction
  required in traditional open surgical techniques, reducing surgical trauma'
- 'Step 3: Reduced surgical invasiveness leads to shorter hospital stays (mean 8.5
  days), faster tracheostomy decannulation (9.7 days), and reduced nasogastric dependence
  (12.8 days)'
- 'Step 4: Pooled complication rate of 32.3% with 92% of complications being low-grade
  (Clavien Dindo grade 2 or 3), indicating manageable morbidity'
- 'Step 5: Long-term tracheostomy dependence occurs in only 0%-11.5% of patients,
  demonstrating favorable functional preservation compared to open techniques'

description: Transoral robotic surgery for salvage treatment of recurrent/residual
  head and neck cancers demonstrates decreased morbidity and mortality compared to
  traditional open surgical techniques. This systematic review of 15 studies (515
  patients) found TORS achieves favorable oncological outcomes (2-year OS 73.8%, DFS
  56.1%) with manageable complications (32.3% pooled rate, mostly low-grade). The
  minimally invasive approach reduces tracheostomy and feeding tube dependence, preserving
  function while treating cancer in previously irradiated tissue.
