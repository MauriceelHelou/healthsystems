category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile applications provide continuous access to disease management tools,
  enabling patients to monitor symptoms, track medication adherence, and receive reminders
  for treatment regimens'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced patient engagement through app-based care facilitates more timely
  communication with healthcare providers and promotes adherence to prescribed treatment
  protocols'
- 'Step 3: Improved self-monitoring and consistent treatment adherence lead to better
  disease control, reduced inflammatory activity, and decreased disease activity scores
  in rheumatoid arthritis patients'

description: Mobile application-based care reduces rheumatoid arthritis disease activity
  through enhanced patient monitoring, improved medication adherence, and better communication
  with healthcare providers. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 RCTs (n=3175)
  demonstrated that mobile app interventions were effective in relieving disease activity
  in RA patients, along with reducing pain and improving quality of life.
