mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-risk populations (people with alcohol use disorder or history of alcohol
  excess) are identified in key healthcare settings including inpatient addiction
  services, outpatient addiction services, general acute hospital admissions, and
  community outreach programs'
- 'Step 2: Proactive fibrosis assessment is conducted using screening tools to detect
  liver damage before clinical symptoms manifest'
- 'Step 3: Screening identifies significant proportions of patients with advanced
  liver disease (fibrosis and cirrhosis) who would otherwise remain undiagnosed'
- 'Step 4: Early detection enables intervention opportunities including reduced alcohol
  intake, hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance enrollment, and management of liver-related
  complications'
- 'Step 5: Earlier identification shifts diagnosis from late-stage presentation (with
  high mortality) to earlier stages with improved treatment potential'

description: Systematic review of 15 studies demonstrates that proactive screening
  for alcohol-related liver disease among high-risk populations (those with AUD or
  alcohol excess history) successfully identifies fibrosis and cirrhosis at earlier
  stages. The yield of screening varies substantially by setting, with acute hospital
  admissions detecting cirrhosis in 10.8%-29.6% of screened individuals, compared
  to 1.2%-2.3% in community outreach. This targeted approach is feasible across multiple
  healthcare settings and identifies patients at risk of advanced liver disease who
  would otherwise present at late stages with poor prognosis.
