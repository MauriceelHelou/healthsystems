  node_name: SARS-CoV-2 Infection Prevalence in Healthcare Workers
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare workers (HCWs) assigned to hospitalization/non-emergency wards
  have prolonged and repeated contact with admitted patients, many of whom may be
  infected with SARS-CoV-2'
- 'Step 2: Non-emergency ward settings may have less stringent infection control protocols
  compared to dedicated COVID-19 units or ICUs, as patients may not initially present
  with typical respiratory symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Extended patient interactions during routine care activities (medication
  administration, vital signs, hygiene assistance) increase cumulative exposure time
  to potentially infectious droplets and aerosols'
- 'Step 4: Unrecognized COVID-19 cases in general wards may lead to inadequate PPE
  use and infection prevention measures, facilitating viral transmission to HCWs'
- 'Step 5: The concentration of COVID-19 positive HCWs in hospitalization/non-emergency
  wards (43% of all positive cases) demonstrates elevated infection prevalence in
  this work setting'

description: Working in hospitalization/non-emergency wards is associated with elevated
  SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among healthcare workers. A systematic review and
  meta-analysis of 97 studies including 230,398 HCWs found that 43% of COVID-19 positive
  medical personnel were working in hospitalization/non-emergency wards during screening,
  making this the most common work setting among infected HCWs. This elevated prevalence
  likely reflects prolonged patient contact, potential for unrecognized COVID-19 cases
  in general ward populations, and possibly less rigorous infection control compared
  to dedicated COVID-19 units.
