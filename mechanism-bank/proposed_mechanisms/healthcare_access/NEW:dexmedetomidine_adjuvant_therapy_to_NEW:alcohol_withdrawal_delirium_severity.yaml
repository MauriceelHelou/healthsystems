category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to neuroadaptive changes creating imbalance
  between inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) neurotransmitters'
- 'Step 2: Upon alcohol cessation in hospitalized ICU patients, standard benzodiazepine-based
  therapy alone is often inadequate to control delirium symptoms due to this neurotransmitter
  imbalance'
- 'Step 3: Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is added as adjuvant therapy
  to benzodiazepine treatment'
- 'Step 4: Dexmedetomidine provides additional sedation and anxiolysis through a different
  mechanism than benzodiazepines, addressing the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance more
  comprehensively'
- 'Step 5: Combined therapy results in decreased alcohol withdrawal delirium severity
  as measured by validated scales (CIWA, RASS, CAM-ICU)'

description: 'This systematic review with meta-analysis of 4 studies (3 retrospective
  and 1 prospective case series) demonstrates that dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant
  to benzodiazepine-based therapy significantly decreases alcohol withdrawal delirium
  severity in adult ICU patients. The meta-analysis of 3 studies using CIWA scores
  showed a weighted mean difference of -5.2 (95% CI: -6.24 to -4.16, p<0.0001), indicating
  clinically meaningful reduction in delirium severity. The mechanism relates to addressing
  the neurotransmitter imbalance that occurs during alcohol withdrawal through complementary
  pharmacological pathways.'
