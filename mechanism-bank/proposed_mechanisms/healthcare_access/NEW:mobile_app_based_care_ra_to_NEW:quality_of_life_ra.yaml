- 'Step 1: Mobile applications provide continuous access to disease monitoring tools,
  medication reminders, and symptom tracking capabilities for RA patients'
- 'Step 2: Regular engagement with app-based care facilitates timely communication
  with healthcare providers and supports adherence to treatment protocols'
- 'Step 3: Improved disease activity monitoring and management leads to reduced disease
  activity scores and decreased joint pain'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in disease symptoms and improved disease control translates to
  enhanced physical functioning and psychological well-being'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative improvements in symptom management and functional capacity result
  in improved overall quality of life for RA patients'

description: Mobile application-based care improves quality of life in rheumatoid
  arthritis patients through enhanced disease monitoring, improved symptom management,
  and better treatment adherence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 8 RCTs
  involving 3,175 patients demonstrated that mobile app interventions effectively
  reduce disease activity, alleviate joint pain, and improve overall quality of life.
  The mechanism operates through continuous access to care tools that facilitate better
  disease control and symptom management.
