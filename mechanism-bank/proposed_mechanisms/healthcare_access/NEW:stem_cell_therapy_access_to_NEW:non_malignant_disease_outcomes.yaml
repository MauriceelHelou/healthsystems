mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to stem cell therapy programs enables patients with non-malignant,
  non-haematological diseases to receive advanced regenerative treatments'
- 'Step 2: Autologous stem cells (75% of cases) or allogenic stem cells (18%) are
  harvested primarily from bone marrow (51%), with alternatives including adipose
  tissue (7%) and other sources'
- 'Step 3: Stem cell transplantation promotes tissue regeneration and repair through
  cellular differentiation and paracrine effects in affected organs'
- 'Step 4: Clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy outcomes, with government
  research hospitals conducting majority of randomized controlled trials'
- 'Step 5: Successful stem cell engraftment and function leads to improved disease-specific
  outcomes across various non-malignant conditions'

description: Access to stem cell therapy for non-malignant diseases enables patients
  to receive regenerative treatments that can improve disease outcomes. A systematic
  review of 61 clinical studies in India (2001-2021) found predominantly autologous
  bone marrow-derived stem cell use across various non-haematological conditions.
  Government research hospitals conducted the majority of rigorous randomized trials,
  highlighting the importance of institutional capacity and regulatory oversight in
  ensuring safe and effective stem cell interventions.
