mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) are administered to patients
  undergoing alcohol withdrawal treatment'
- 'Step 2: These medications bind to voltage-gated calcium channels (α2δ subunit),
  modulating neuronal excitability and reducing hyperexcitability associated with
  alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: GABAergic transmission is enhanced while glutamatergic overactivity (which
  occurs during withdrawal) is reduced'
- 'Step 4: This neurochemical modulation attenuates autonomic hyperactivity, anxiety,
  and seizure risk characteristic of severe alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 5: Clinical manifestations of alcohol withdrawal syndrome are reduced in severity,
  leading to lower withdrawal severity scores'

description: Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) reduce alcohol withdrawal
  severity through their action on voltage-gated calcium channels and modulation of
  GABAergic/glutamatergic neurotransmission. This systematic review and meta-analysis
  examined multiple randomized controlled trials evaluating gabapentinoid effects
  on withdrawal symptoms in patients with alcohol use disorder, finding evidence supporting
  their efficacy in reducing withdrawal severity, craving, and associated symptoms.
