- 'Step 1: Virtual surgical planning (VSP) enables precise pre-operative modeling
  and simulation of head and neck reconstruction procedures'
- 'Step 2: Pre-operative planning reduces intraoperative complications and improves
  surgical accuracy, leading to more predictable outcomes'
- 'Step 3: Reduced operating room time and fewer intraoperative complications decrease
  post-operative recovery needs'
- 'Step 4: Shorter recovery requirements translate to reduced hospital length of stay
  (LOS) compared to traditional freehand surgery'

description: A systematic review of 18 studies (n=733) found that virtual surgical
  planning in head and neck reconstruction is associated with reduced hospital length
  of stay compared to traditional freehand surgery. The majority of cost savings from
  VSP were generated through reduced operating room times and shortened length of
  stay/hospitalization. Fourteen of 18 studies (78%) found VSP either generated cost
  savings or was comparable to freehand surgery.
