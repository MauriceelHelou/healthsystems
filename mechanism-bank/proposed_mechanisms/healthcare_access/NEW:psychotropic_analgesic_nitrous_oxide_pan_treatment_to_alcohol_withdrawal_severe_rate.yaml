category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PAN (psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide) is administered to patients
  experiencing alcohol withdrawal syndrome as an alternative to benzodiazepine treatment'
- 'Step 2: PAN acts on neurological pathways to produce psychotropic and analgesic
  effects, improving withdrawal symptoms more rapidly than sedative-based regimens'
- 'Step 3: Treatment with PAN reduces the amount and duration of sedative medication
  required to manage withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 4: PAN improves psychomotor function in patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal
  compared to standard treatments'
- 'Step 5: The rapid therapeutic effect and reduced sedation requirements decrease
  overall alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity, enabling faster transition to psychological
  treatment phases'

description: Psychotropic analgesic nitrous oxide (PAN) treatment reduces alcohol
  withdrawal syndrome severity by improving symptoms more rapidly than standard benzodiazepine
  regimens. A Cochrane systematic review of 5 RCTs (212 participants) found PAN significantly
  improved withdrawal symptoms (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01-1.79), reduced sedative medication
  requirements, and improved psychomotor function (WMD -8.71, 95% CI -13.71 to -3.71).
  The rapid therapeutic effect allows patients to enter psychological treatment phases
  more quickly.
