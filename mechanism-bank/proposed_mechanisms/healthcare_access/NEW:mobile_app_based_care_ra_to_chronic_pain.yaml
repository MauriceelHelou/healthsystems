- 'Step 1: Mobile applications provide RA patients with continuous access to disease
  monitoring, medication reminders, and symptom tracking tools'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced patient engagement and adherence to treatment regimens through
  real-time feedback and educational content delivered via mobile platforms'
- 'Step 3: Improved disease management leads to better control of inflammatory processes
  and reduced disease activity scores'
- 'Step 4: Decreased disease activity results in alleviation of joint pain and improved
  quality of life for RA patients'
