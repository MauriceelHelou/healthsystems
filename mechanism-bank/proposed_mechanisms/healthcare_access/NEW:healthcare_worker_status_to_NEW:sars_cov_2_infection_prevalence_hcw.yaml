direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare workers have direct, repeated occupational exposure to patients
  with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical settings'
- 'Step 2: Close contact during patient care activities (examination, treatment, aerosol-generating
  procedures) increases transmission risk despite PPE use'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare workers in hospitalization/non-emergency wards face sustained
  exposure during extended patient interactions, with nurses having highest contact
  frequency'
- 'Step 4: Occupational exposure results in elevated SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence
  (11% by RT-PCR, 7% by antibody testing) among healthcare workers compared to general
  population'

description: Healthcare worker occupational status directly increases SARS-CoV-2 infection
  prevalence due to routine, sustained occupational exposure to infected patients
  in clinical settings. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 97 studies including
  230,398 healthcare workers found an estimated SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence of
  11% by RT-PCR testing and 7% by antibody testing. Nurses represented the most affected
  group (48% of positive cases), and hospitalization/non-emergency ward workers had
  the highest infection rates. Notably, 40% of RT-PCR positive healthcare workers
  were asymptomatic at diagnosis, highlighting the risk of undetected transmission
  within healthcare settings.
