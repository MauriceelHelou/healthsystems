category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gabapentin is administered to hospitalized patients experiencing acute
  alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) as an adjunctive or alternative treatment to benzodiazepines'
- 'Step 2: Gabapentin modulates voltage-gated calcium channels and may enhance GABAergic
  neurotransmission, providing anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects that address
  AWS symptoms through a different mechanism than benzodiazepines'
- 'Step 3: In patients with severe AWS, gabapentin treatment is associated with reduced
  benzodiazepine requirements, potentially due to its ability to manage withdrawal
  symptoms and reduce the need for additional sedation'
- 'Step 4: The reduction in benzodiazepine use may decrease risks associated with
  benzodiazepine administration including respiratory depression, oversedation, and
  potential for dependence'

description: This meta-analysis of 8 retrospective studies (n=2030) examined whether
  gabapentin can reduce benzodiazepine use in hospitalized patients with acute alcohol
  withdrawal syndrome. Overall results showed no significant difference in benzodiazepine
  amounts between gabapentin-treated and benzodiazepine-treated groups. However, subgroup
  analysis of severe AWS patients revealed a significant decrease in benzodiazepine
  administration in gabapentin-treated patients (p=0.02). All included studies were
  retrospective with high risk of confounding, and in most cases gabapentin-treated
  patients may have received benzodiazepines prior to gabapentin initiation.
