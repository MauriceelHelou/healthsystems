direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with chronic noncancer pain are prescribed opioid medications
  for pain management'
- 'Step 2: Long-term opioid use leads to physiological effects including respiratory
  depression, sedation, and potential development of opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 3: These physiological effects increase risk of fatal overdose (pooled rate
  1.1 per 1000 person-years) and other adverse health outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Combined overdose mortality and other opioid-related complications contribute
  to elevated all-cause mortality (pooled rate 28.8 per 1000 person-years)'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 cohorts with over 6 million
  participants found that people prescribed opioids (primarily for chronic noncancer
  pain) had a pooled all-cause crude mortality rate of 28.8 per 1000 person-years
  and overdose crude mortality rate of 1.1 per 1000 person-years. The substantial
  heterogeneity reflects variations in prescribing practices, patient populations,
  and outcome ascertainment across studies.
