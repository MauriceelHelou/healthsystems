mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Targeted midwifery models implement continuity of carer approaches, establishing
  trusted relationships between midwives and women from disadvantaged populations
  who face barriers to standard care'
- 'Step 2: Home visiting components remove geographic, transportation, and time-based
  barriers that typically delay care initiation, bringing prenatal services directly
  to women in their communities'
- 'Step 3: Culturally and linguistically appropriate care addresses cultural barriers,
  mistrust of healthcare systems, and communication challenges that often prevent
  early engagement with prenatal services among minority ethnic groups'
- 'Step 4: The interpersonal and holistic approach enhances accessibility and promotes
  earlier engagement with antenatal care services'
- 'Step 5: These combined elements result in increased antenatal care coverage and
  earlier first trimester prenatal care attendance among at-risk populations'

description: Targeted midwifery models of care that incorporate continuity of carer,
  home visiting, and culturally appropriate services improve access to first trimester
  prenatal care among disadvantaged populations. These models take an interpersonal
  and holistic approach that addresses multiple barriers to early care engagement
  including geographic access, cultural mistrust, and communication challenges. The
  systematic review found positive associations with antenatal care coverage and access
  to care outcomes.
