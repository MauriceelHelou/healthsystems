mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are administered as primary treatment for
  alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) instead of benzodiazepines'
- 'Step 2: ASMs demonstrate inferior efficacy in controlling AWS symptoms compared
  to benzodiazepines, the current standard of care'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate symptom control with ASMs leads to breakthrough withdrawal symptoms
  requiring additional pharmacological intervention'
- 'Step 4: Patients on ASMs have significantly higher odds (OR: 3.50) of requiring
  rescue medications to manage uncontrolled AWS symptoms'

description: Anti-seizure medication use in alcohol withdrawal syndrome is associated
  with a 3.5-fold increase in the odds of requiring rescue medications compared to
  benzodiazepine treatment. This systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 RCTs (n=2223)
  found no evidence supporting ASMs as first-line treatment for AWS, with significantly
  higher rescue medication requirements indicating inferior symptom control.
