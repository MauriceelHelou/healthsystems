mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome are admitted
  to inpatient settings and prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as carbamazepine,
  valproic acid, or other anticonvulsants'
- 'Step 2: AEDs are intended to modulate neuronal excitability by blocking voltage-gated
  sodium channels, enhancing GABAergic inhibition, or reducing glutamatergic transmission
  to prevent seizure activity'
- 'Step 3: Despite theoretical mechanisms, systematic evidence shows AEDs provide
  no significant benefit over placebo or standard treatments in reducing seizure incidence
  during AWS (RR = 1.0, indicating no effect)'
- 'Step 4: The lack of demonstrated efficacy means that AED treatment does not reduce
  alcohol withdrawal seizure incidence compared to alternative approaches'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 randomized controlled
  trials (n=1709) found no significant benefit of antiepileptic drug treatment in
  preventing seizures during moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The pooled
  relative risk was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.76-1.33), indicating AEDs neither increase nor
  decrease seizure incidence compared to other treatments or placebo. The evidence
  quality was rated as moderate using GRADE methodology, leading to a weak recommendation
  against routine AED use for AWS unless indicated for comorbid conditions.'
