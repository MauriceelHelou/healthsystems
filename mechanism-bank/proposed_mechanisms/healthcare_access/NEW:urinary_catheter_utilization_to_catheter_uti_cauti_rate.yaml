category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher urinary catheter utilization rates increase the number of patients
  exposed to indwelling urinary catheters in hospital settings (ICUs and non-ICUs)'
- 'Step 2: Catheter insertion provides a direct pathway for bacterial entry into the
  normally sterile urinary tract, bypassing natural defense mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Duration of catheterization compounds infection risk as biofilm formation
  on catheter surfaces facilitates bacterial colonization and ascension'
- 'Step 4: Increased catheter-days at the population level directly translates to
  higher CAUTI incidence rates, as CAUTI is mathematically defined as infections per
  1,000 catheter-days'
- 'Step 5: Multifaceted interventions targeting catheter utilization reduction (such
  as the STRIVE initiative) demonstrate that lowering utilization rates reduces CAUTI
  rates proportionally'

description: Urinary catheter utilization rate directly drives CAUTI incidence through
  increased exposure time and opportunity for bacterial colonization. The CDC STRIVE
  initiative and multiple systematic reviews confirm that reducing inappropriate catheter
  use is the primary mechanism for CAUTI prevention. Meta-analysis of multifaceted
  interventions targeting catheter utilization shows pooled CAUTI incidence rate ratio
  of 0.54 (95% CI 0.45-0.66) compared to standard care, demonstrating that lower utilization
  leads to proportionally lower CAUTI rates.
