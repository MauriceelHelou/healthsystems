- 'Step 1: Interdisciplinary care teams are deployed to coordinate multi-agency health
  and social services for pregnant women with complex social needs (e.g., housing
  instability, substance use, mental health challenges)'
- 'Step 2: Care coordination addresses structural barriers by connecting women to
  social workers, housing specialists, mental health providers, and medical professionals
  in a unified approach'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive case management ensures earlier engagement with prenatal
  care and addresses social determinants that contribute to pregnancy complications'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in unmet social needs decreases maternal stress, improves nutrition
  access, and ensures consistent prenatal monitoring'
- 'Step 5: Improved management of social complexity and pregnancy risk factors leads
  to reduced preterm birth rates among disadvantaged populations'

description: Interdisciplinary care coordination takes a structural approach to coordinate
  care for pregnant women requiring multi-agency health and social services. This
  systematic review of 46 studies found that targeted interventions addressing complex
  social needs showed positive associations with reduced preterm birth among disadvantaged
  populations in high-income countries. The approach addresses health inequalities
  by coordinating medical care with social services to comprehensively manage pregnancy
  risk factors.
