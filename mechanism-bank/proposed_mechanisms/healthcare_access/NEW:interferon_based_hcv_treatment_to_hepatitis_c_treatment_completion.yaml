direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Interferon-based therapy (conventional or pegylated interferon) is administered
  to HCV-infected patients, initiating antiviral immune response'
- 'Step 2: Treatment induces viral suppression through interferon''s immunomodulatory
  and antiviral effects'
- 'Step 3: Sustained viral response (SVR) is achieved in approximately 40% of treated
  patients overall, with 33% SVR rate in genotype 1'
- 'Step 4: Treatment completion and SVR are moderated by adverse events (flu-like
  syndrome in 41%, anemia, cytopenia) leading to 11% treatment discontinuation'
- 'Step 5: Successful completion results in undetectable HCV RNA at follow-up, indicating
  viral clearance'

description: Interferon-based HCV treatment leads to sustained viral response (treatment
  completion/cure) in approximately 40% of patients overall. This meta-analysis of
  hemodialysis patients across two 2008 meta-analyses (645 and 459 patients respectively,
  with 19 overlapping studies) demonstrates that while treatment is effective, completion
  rates are affected by genotype (33% SVR for genotype 1), adverse events requiring
  treatment withdrawal (11%), and patient-specific factors. Pegylated interferon showed
  minimal advantage over conventional interferon in this population.
