direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Interferon-based HCV treatment (conventional or pegylated interferon) is
  administered to hemodialysis patients with hepatitis C infection'
- 'Step 2: Interferon induces systemic inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses,
  causing flu-like syndrome in approximately 41% of patients'
- 'Step 3: Bone marrow suppression from interferon leads to cytopenia, with high rates
  of anemia particularly problematic in dialysis patients who already have impaired
  erythropoietin production'
- 'Step 4: Additional adverse events manifest across multiple organ systems including
  thyroid dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems, central nervous system effects,
  cardiovascular complications, and increased infection risk'
- 'Step 5: Severe adverse events lead to treatment discontinuation in approximately
  11% of patients, with immunological complications including prior graft rejection
  in transplant candidates'

description: Interferon-based HCV treatment in hemodialysis patients causes multiple
  adverse events including flu-like syndrome (41%), anemia, cytopenia, thyroid dysfunction,
  gastrointestinal problems, CNS effects, cardiovascular complications, infectious
  problems, and immunological reactions including graft rejection. Approximately 11%
  of patients require treatment discontinuation due to severe adverse events. The
  hemodialysis population is particularly vulnerable due to pre-existing anemia and
  altered drug pharmacokinetics.
