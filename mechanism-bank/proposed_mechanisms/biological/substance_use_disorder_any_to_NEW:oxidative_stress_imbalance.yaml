direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic substance use (alcohol, stimulants, nicotine, opioids, cannabis)
  leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through direct metabolic
  effects and mitochondrial dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Elevated ROS causes accumulation of oxidant markers including malondialdehyde
  (MDA), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and lipid peroxidation products'
- 'Step 3: Concurrent depletion of antioxidant defenses occurs, with reduced superoxide
  dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased total antioxidant capacity/status'
- 'Step 4: The imbalance between oxidant production and antioxidant defense creates
  a state of oxidative stress, leading to cellular damage and contributing to multiple
  comorbidities including accelerated aging'

description: Substance use disorder causes a clear oxidative imbalance characterized
  by elevated oxidant markers (malondialdehyde, TBARS, lipid peroxidation) and reduced
  antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity). This systematic
  review and meta-analysis found consistent evidence across multiple substance types
  including stimulants, alcohol, nicotine, opioids, cannabis, and polysubstance use.
  The oxidative stress imbalance may contribute to cellular damage and accelerated
  aging observed in persons with SUD.
