direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heart failure patients accumulate multiple comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes,
  COPD, CKD, depression, anemia) that create additive physiological and psychological
  burden'
- 'Step 2: Each comorbid condition contributes independent symptom burden including
  fatigue, dyspnea, pain, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations that compound
  HF symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Multiple comorbidities reduce self-care confidence and ability to manage
  complex medication regimens and lifestyle modifications required for HF management'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative effect of symptom burden, treatment complexity, and reduced
  functional capacity leads to diminished health-related quality of life and poorer
  self-rated health'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 studies demonstrates that
  comorbidity burden in heart failure patients is significantly associated with poorer
  health-related quality of life. The presence of multiple comorbid conditions creates
  cumulative physiological stress, increases symptom burden, reduces self-care capacity,
  and leads to diminished quality of life. Key comorbidities including diabetes, COPD,
  chronic kidney disease, depression, and anemia each contribute independently to
  worse outcomes.
