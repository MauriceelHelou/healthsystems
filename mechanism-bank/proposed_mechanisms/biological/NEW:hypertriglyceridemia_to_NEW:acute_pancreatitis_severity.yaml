direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hypertriglyceridemia leads to excessive accumulation of triglycerides in
  the bloodstream, which can be hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase into free fatty acids'
- 'Step 2: High concentrations of free fatty acids in pancreatic tissue cause direct
  cytotoxic damage to pancreatic acinar cells and capillary endothelium'
- 'Step 3: This lipotoxicity triggers an exaggerated inflammatory cascade, increased
  oxidative stress, and microcirculatory disturbances in the pancreas'
- 'Step 4: The heightened inflammatory response leads to more severe local and systemic
  complications, including higher rates of organ failure, pancreatic necrosis, and
  increased mortality compared to other etiologies'

description: Hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) is associated
  with the highest risk of non-mild (moderately severe and severe) disease course
  compared to other common etiologies including alcoholic, biliary, and post-ERCP
  pancreatitis. Meta-analysis of 127 studies demonstrated that HTG-AP patients have
  significantly higher mortality rates (OR 1.72 vs alcoholic AP; OR 1.50 vs biliary
  AP) and the highest number of complications. The mechanism involves lipotoxicity
  from excessive free fatty acid release causing direct pancreatic tissue damage and
  amplified systemic inflammatory responses.
