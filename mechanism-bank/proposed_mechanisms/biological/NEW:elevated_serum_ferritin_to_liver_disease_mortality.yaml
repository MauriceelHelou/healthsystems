direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated serum ferritin reflects increased iron stores and/or inflammatory
  processes in the liver, with prevalence of ~40.6% in patients with decompensated
  cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Iron overload contributes to oxidative stress and hepatocellular damage
  through Fenton reactions generating reactive oxygen species'
- 'Step 3: Ferritin elevation also serves as an acute phase reactant indicating systemic
  inflammation and hepatic dysfunction severity'
- 'Step 4: Higher ferritin levels correlate with more advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh
  grade C), hepatic encephalopathy, and worse liver synthetic function'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects of iron-mediated toxicity and inflammation accelerate
  liver failure progression, leading to increased mortality risk'

description: This meta-analysis of 8 studies with 1829 patients demonstrates that
  elevated serum ferritin is significantly associated with increased mortality in
  patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Nonsurvivors had substantially higher ferritin
  levels (mean difference 247.90 ng/mL) compared to survivors. The pooled unadjusted
  hazard ratio of 2.38 indicates that patients with elevated ferritin have more than
  double the risk of death. The association showed low heterogeneity across studies,
  suggesting consistent findings.
