direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of NO2 leads to entry into the respiratory system and subsequent
  absorption into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 2: NO2 exposure triggers oxidative stress and systemic inflammation through
  generation of reactive oxygen species'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory mediators and oxidative damage promote endothelial dysfunction
  and vascular inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic or acute exposure leads to autonomic dysfunction, increased blood
  pressure, and accelerated atherosclerosis'
- 'Step 5: These cardiovascular insults increase risk of acute cardiovascular events
  (myocardial infarction, stroke) leading to mortality'

description: Each 10 μg/m³ increase in NO2 concentration is associated with a 1.12%
  excess risk of cardiovascular mortality. NO2 showed the highest excess risk among
  all pollutants studied (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3). The effect is strongest with lag
  0-1 day exposure, indicating acute effects. Vulnerable populations include females,
  elderly (≥65 years), and those exposed during cooler temperatures.
