direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) develops from chronic alcohol consumption,
  causing hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation associated with ALD extend
  beyond the liver, affecting multiple organ systems'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol exposure in ALD patients causes direct toxic effects
  on extra-hepatic organs including cardiovascular, neurological, and pancreatic systems'
- 'Step 4: Portal hypertension and metabolic dysfunction from liver disease contribute
  to multi-organ complications'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative extra-hepatic damage manifests as increased morbidity including
  cardiovascular disease, malignancies, and neurological disorders'

description: 'Patients with alcohol-related liver disease face elevated risk of extra-hepatic
  morbidity through multiple pathways: direct alcohol toxicity to non-hepatic organs,
  systemic inflammatory responses originating from liver dysfunction, metabolic derangements
  associated with impaired hepatic function, and portal hypertension effects. This
  systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that ALD patients experience significantly
  increased rates of conditions affecting cardiovascular, neurological, pancreatic,
  and other organ systems beyond their primary liver pathology.'
