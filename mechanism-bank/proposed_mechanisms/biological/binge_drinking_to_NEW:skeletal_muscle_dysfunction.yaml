category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking episodes expose skeletal muscle to acute high concentrations
  of ethanol and its metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts the balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways in
  muscle tissue, favoring protein degradation over synthesis'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol impairs mitochondrial function and energetic balance, reducing
  ATP production and oxidative capacity in muscle fibers'
- 'Step 4: Inflammatory responses are increased while muscle regeneration capacity
  is reduced following alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 5: Fibrotic changes develop in muscle tissue, contributing to structural and
  functional impairment'
- 'Step 6: These combined effects result in muscle weakness, atrophy, impaired recovery
  after exercise, and reduced athletic performance'

description: Binge drinking leads to skeletal muscle dysfunction through multiple
  interconnected biological mechanisms. Alcohol consumption creates an imbalance between
  anabolic and catabolic pathways, reduces muscle regeneration capacity, increases
  inflammation and fibrosis, and impairs mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.
  These effects collectively contribute to muscle weakness, atrophy, impaired post-exercise
  recovery, and reduced athletic performance. While chronic alcohol misuse causes
  the most severe form (alcoholic myopathy), binge drinking patterns common among
  athletes can also negatively impact muscle function.
