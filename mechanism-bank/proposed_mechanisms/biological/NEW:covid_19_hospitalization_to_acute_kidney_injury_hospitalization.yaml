direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to hospitalization with systemic inflammatory
  response and cytokine storm affecting multiple organ systems'
- 'Step 2: Direct viral injury to kidney tissue occurs through ACE2 receptor binding
  expressed on renal tubular cells, combined with indirect injury from hemodynamic
  instability, hypoxia, and nephrotoxic medications'
- 'Step 3: Acute kidney injury develops, with approximately 15.4% of hospitalized
  COVID-19 patients experiencing AKI, rising to 53% in severe cases'
- 'Step 4: A subset of patients (4.3%) require renal replacement therapy due to severity
  of kidney damage'
- 'Step 5: AKI significantly increases mortality risk, with deceased COVID-19 patients
  having 15.4 times higher odds of AKI compared to survivors'

description: COVID-19 hospitalization is strongly associated with acute kidney injury
  through multiple pathophysiological mechanisms including direct viral cytopathic
  effects, cytokine-mediated injury, and hemodynamic alterations. Meta-analysis of
  39 studies comprising 25,566 patients demonstrates a pooled AKI incidence of 15.4%
  among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, increasing to 53% in severe cases. AKI is
  strongly predictive of mortality, with deceased patients having 15.4-fold higher
  odds of AKI compared to survivors.
