direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive liver disease (from no disease to cirrhosis to decompensation)
  reduces hepatic functional reserve and metabolic capacity'
- 'Step 2: Impaired liver function leads to decreased ability to metabolize alcohol
  and manage its toxic byproducts, increasing vulnerability to alcohol-related complications'
- 'Step 3: Advanced liver disease is associated with complications such as portal
  hypertension, variceal bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy that can be
  precipitated or worsened by continued alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 4: These complications, combined with reduced physiological resilience, result
  in significantly higher rates of alcohol-related hospitalizations as liver disease
  severity increases'

description: 'Progressive liver disease severity, from no liver disease through cirrhosis
  to decompensated cirrhosis, is strongly associated with increased alcohol-related
  hospitalization rates. In a retrospective cohort of patients with alcohol use disorder,
  2-year hospitalization rates increased in a dose-response pattern: 8.2% for those
  without liver disease, 27.7% for liver disease without cirrhosis, 40.5% for cirrhosis,
  and 41.7% for decompensated cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was an independent predictor of
  subsequent hospitalization with a hazard ratio of 5.16.'
