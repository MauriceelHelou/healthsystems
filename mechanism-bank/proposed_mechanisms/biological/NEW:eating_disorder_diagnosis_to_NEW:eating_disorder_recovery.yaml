category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Formal eating disorder diagnosis (AN, BN, BED, OSFED) enables identification
  of pathological eating behaviors and associated physiological dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Diagnosis facilitates access to evidence-based treatments including family-based
  therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, nutritional interventions,
  and pharmacological treatments specific to each ED subtype'
- 'Step 3: Treatment engagement addresses core biological mechanisms including metabolic
  dysregulation, weight restoration (in AN), normalization of binge-purge cycles,
  and neurobiological reward system dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Over time, with appropriate treatment, approximately 46% of diagnosed individuals
  achieve overall recovery, with rates improving progressively from 42% at <2 years
  to 67% at ≥10 years follow-up'

description: This meta-analysis of 415 studies (N=88,372) demonstrates that individuals
  with formal eating disorder diagnoses achieve overall recovery in 46% of cases,
  with recovery rates improving substantially over time from 42% at <2 years to 67%
  at ≥10 years. The diagnosis enables access to disorder-specific evidence-based treatments.
  Chronicity occurs in approximately 25% of cases, and mortality is 0.4% overall (5.2
  deaths/1,000 person-years in observational studies). Recovery rates showed no significant
  differences among ED subtypes (AN, BN, BED, OSFED), though hospitalization rates
  varied significantly (32% for AN vs 4% for BN).
