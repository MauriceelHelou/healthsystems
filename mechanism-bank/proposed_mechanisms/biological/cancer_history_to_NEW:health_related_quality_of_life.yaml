mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cancer diagnosis and treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation) cause
  direct physical damage to tissues, organs, and physiological systems'
- 'Step 2: Cancer survivors experience persistent treatment-related side effects including
  fatigue, pain, neuropathy, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations'
- 'Step 3: These physical impairments combine with psychological distress (anxiety,
  depression, fear of recurrence) to reduce overall health-related quality of life'
- 'Step 4: Without intervention, cancer survivors face significant and sustained reductions
  in physical, emotional, social, and functional well-being domains of HRQoL'

description: Cancer history negatively impacts health-related quality of life through
  multiple biological and psychological pathways. Cancer survivors face significant
  HRQoL challenges stemming from disease and treatment effects including physical
  impairments, persistent symptoms, and psychological distress. This meta-analysis
  of 48 RCTs involving 3,050 cancer survivors demonstrates that while cancer history
  reduces HRQoL, structured exercise interventions can significantly improve outcomes,
  with optimal benefits at specific dose thresholds.
