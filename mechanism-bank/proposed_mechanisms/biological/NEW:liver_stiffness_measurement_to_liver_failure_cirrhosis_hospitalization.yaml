mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) quantifies hepatic fibrosis through non-invasive
  elastography techniques (transient elastography, MR elastography, ARFI, shear wave
  elastography), detecting extracellular matrix accumulation and architectural distortion'
- 'Step 2: Higher LSM values (particularly >20-25 kPa) reflect advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis
  with portal hypertension, characterized by increased intrahepatic resistance and
  sinusoidal capillarization'
- 'Step 3: Portal hypertension leads to development of varices, ascites, and hepatic
  encephalopathy - the hallmarks of hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Decompensated cirrhosis manifests clinically as liver failure requiring
  hospitalization for management of complications including variceal bleeding, refractory
  ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome'

description: Liver stiffness measurement serves as a non-invasive biomarker that directly
  reflects the degree of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Higher LSM values, particularly
  above 20-25 kPa, demonstrate strong predictive power for hepatic decompensation
  events leading to hospitalization. The measurement captures the underlying pathophysiology
  of advanced liver disease including portal hypertension, which drives clinical decompensation
  requiring hospitalization.
