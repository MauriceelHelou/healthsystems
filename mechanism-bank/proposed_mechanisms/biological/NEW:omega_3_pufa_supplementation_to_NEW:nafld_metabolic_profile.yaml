direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Omega-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) are incorporated into hepatocyte cell membranes
  and serve as substrates for anti-inflammatory mediator synthesis'
- 'Step 2: Omega-3 PUFAs activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs),
  particularly PPAR-alpha, enhancing hepatic fatty acid oxidation'
- 'Step 3: Reduced hepatic lipogenesis and enhanced lipid metabolism lead to decreased
  triglyceride accumulation in the liver'
- 'Step 4: Improved hepatic lipid handling results in reduced hepatocellular injury,
  manifested as decreased ALT and AST levels'
- 'Step 5: Systemic lipid profile improvements occur with reductions in serum triglycerides,
  LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol'

description: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation improves metabolic profiles in NAFLD patients
  through multiple mechanisms including enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation, reduced
  lipogenesis, and anti-inflammatory effects. Meta-analysis of 15 studies demonstrated
  significant reductions in liver enzymes (ALT mean difference -2.12, AST mean difference
  -1.50) and improvements in serum lipid profiles including triglycerides, LDL, and
  total cholesterol. While impact on liver fat content remains uncertain, omega-3
  supplementation provides beneficial effects on metabolic parameters in NAFLD.
