direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bipolar disorder creates chronic physiological stress through mood episode
  cycling, disrupted sleep patterns, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
  dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: The disorder increases risk of suicide (RR=11.69) and other unnatural causes
  of death (RR=7.29) through impulsivity during episodes, hopelessness, and impaired
  judgment'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with BD have elevated rates of cardiovascular disease (RR=1.76),
  respiratory disease (RR=3.18), and infectious disease mortality (RR=4.38) due to
  metabolic effects of medications, lifestyle factors, and reduced healthcare access'
- 'Step 4: Somatic comorbidities compound the mortality risk through inflammation,
  metabolic syndrome, and reduced adherence to medical treatment for physical conditions'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects of psychiatric symptoms, medication side effects, lifestyle
  factors, and healthcare disparities result in approximately 2-fold increased all-cause
  mortality'

description: 'Bipolar disorder is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of all-cause
  mortality compared to the general population. This excess mortality operates through
  multiple pathways: dramatically elevated suicide risk (RR=11.69), increased unnatural
  death from other causes (RR=7.29), and substantially elevated natural cause mortality
  (RR=1.90) particularly from infectious, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases.
  The meta-analysis of 57 studies with 678,353 individuals with BD represents the
  largest synthesis of evidence on this topic.'
