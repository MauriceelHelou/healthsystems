direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hepatic oxidative stress generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that overwhelm
  cellular antioxidant defenses in liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: ROS cause direct damage to hepatocyte membranes, proteins, and DNA, leading
  to cellular dysfunction and various forms of cell death including apoptosis, necroptosis,
  and ferroptosis'
- 'Step 3: Oxidative stress triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress and abnormal lipid
  metabolism, promoting lipid accumulation and steatosis'
- 'Step 4: Damaged hepatocytes release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs),
  activating liver immune responses and inflammatory pathways'
- 'Step 5: Chronic oxidative damage and inflammation stimulate hepatic stellate cell
  activation, leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 6: Advanced liver disease progression increases risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
  and end-stage liver failure, culminating in liver disease mortality'

description: Hepatic oxidative stress is a critical pathogenic mechanism in liver
  disease progression and mortality. Oxidative stress damages hepatocytes through
  multiple mechanisms including direct cellular injury, lipid peroxidation, endoplasmic
  reticulum stress, and activation of cell death pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis,
  ferroptosis). This damage triggers inflammatory responses and immune activation,
  leading to progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma.
  The cumulative hepatic damage from chronic oxidative stress ultimately increases
  liver disease mortality risk.
