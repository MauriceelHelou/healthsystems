direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol abstinence eliminates ongoing hepatotoxic exposure from ethanol
  and its metabolites (acetaldehyde), halting direct hepatocyte injury'
- 'Step 2: Cessation of alcohol consumption reduces oxidative stress, inflammation,
  and immune activation in liver tissue, allowing hepatic regeneration to occur'
- 'Step 3: Without continued alcohol-induced damage, progression of fibrosis slows
  or halts, and in some cases partial reversal of cirrhotic changes may occur'
- 'Step 4: Improved liver function reduces risk of decompensation events (ascites,
  variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy) that necessitate hospitalization'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of acute-on-chronic liver failure and reduced disease progression
  decrease liver failure/cirrhosis hospitalization rates'

description: Alcohol abstinence reduces liver failure and cirrhosis hospitalization
  through elimination of ongoing hepatotoxic injury. In patients with alcohol use
  disorder and co-morbid liver diseases, abstinence rates of 53% were achieved, with
  higher rates (63%) in those with alcohol-related liver disease specifically. Sustained
  abstinence halts disease progression and allows for hepatic recovery, reducing hospitalization
  risk for liver decompensation events.
