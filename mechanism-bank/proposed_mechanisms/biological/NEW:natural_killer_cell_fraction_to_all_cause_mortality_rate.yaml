direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune cells that provide critical
  immunosurveillance against infected and malignant cells'
- 'Step 2: Higher NK cell fractions in blood reflect enhanced capacity for early detection
  and elimination of abnormal cells, including cancer cells and virus-infected cells'
- 'Step 3: NK cells produce cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α) that coordinate broader immune
  responses and enhance adaptive immunity'
- 'Step 4: Increased NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance reduces accumulation of malignant
  cells and chronic infections that contribute to mortality'
- 'Step 5: Higher NK cell fractions are associated with healthier lifestyle factors
  (exercise, better sleep) and lower levels of harmful exposures (less obesity, smoking,
  stress), which may partially mediate the mortality association'
- 'Step 6: The protective effect of NK cells on mortality operates independently of
  major epidemiological risk factors and baseline comorbidity'

description: Higher natural killer cell fractions in blood are associated with reduced
  all-cause mortality risk, independent of major epidemiological risk factors and
  baseline comorbidity. This relationship likely reflects NK cells' critical role
  in immunosurveillance against malignant and infected cells. The meta-analysis of
  22 cohorts with DNA methylation-derived immune cell fractions demonstrated that
  immune cell composition, including NK cells, has predictive value for mortality
  outcomes, with a machine learning model achieving C-index of 0.69 using immune fractions
  alone and 0.83 when combined with epidemiological factors.
