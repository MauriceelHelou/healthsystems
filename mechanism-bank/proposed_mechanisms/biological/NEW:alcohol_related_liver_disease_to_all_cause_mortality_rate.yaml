mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) causes progressive hepatic dysfunction
  including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, directly increasing
  mortality risk from liver failure and complications'
- 'Step 2: Patients with ALD experience significant extra-hepatic morbidity including
  cardiovascular disease, infections, and malignancies due to systemic effects of
  chronic alcohol exposure and immune dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Combined hepatic and extra-hepatic disease burden leads to substantially
  elevated all-cause mortality rates compared to general population'

description: Alcohol-related liver disease significantly increases all-cause mortality
  through both direct hepatic complications (liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma,
  variceal bleeding) and extra-hepatic conditions. This systematic review and meta-analysis
  demonstrates that ALD patients face elevated mortality risk from multiple organ
  systems affected by chronic alcohol exposure, including cardiovascular disease,
  infections, and non-hepatic malignancies.
