category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 disease severity progresses through clinical stages (mild, moderate,
  severe, critical), with accumulating organ system involvement'
- 'Step 2: Severe cases develop life-threatening complications including acute respiratory
  distress syndrome (ARDS; 94.17% in critical cases), respiratory failure (90.69%
  in critical cases), and multi-organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Respiratory failure dramatically increases risk of ICU admission (OR 105.12),
  as patients require intensive respiratory support and monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Critical complications including shock and ARDS represent the highest estimated
  risk for ICU admission and subsequent mortality'
- 'Step 5: The presence of comorbidities (especially renal insufficiency with OR 17.43
  for severe/critical progression) compounds disease severity and accelerates deterioration
  requiring ICU-level care'

description: COVID-19 disease severity is strongly and positively associated with
  ICU admission and death through a biological cascade of progressive respiratory
  and multi-organ dysfunction. As disease progresses from mild to critical stages,
  patients develop increasingly severe complications, with respiratory failure (OR
  105.12) and ARDS being the strongest predictors of ICU admission. The meta-analysis
  of 187 studies with 77,013 patients demonstrates that comorbidities and complications
  are positively associated with increased risk of ICU admission, disease exacerbation,
  and death during hospitalization.
