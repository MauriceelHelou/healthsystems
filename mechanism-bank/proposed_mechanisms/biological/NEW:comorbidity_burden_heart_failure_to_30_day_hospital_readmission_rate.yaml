direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heart failure patients accumulate multiple comorbid conditions (diabetes,
  COPD, CKD, stroke, IHD, anemia, cancer, atrial fibrillation, dementia, depression)
  that create complex physiological interactions'
- 'Step 2: Each comorbidity contributes additional pathophysiological burden - for
  example, CKD impairs fluid management, COPD compromises respiratory compensation,
  diabetes accelerates vascular damage, and anemia reduces oxygen-carrying capacity'
- 'Step 3: Multiple comorbidities complicate treatment regimens, increase medication
  interactions, and reduce patient self-care capacity and confidence'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative physiological stress and management complexity leads to
  faster clinical deterioration and incomplete recovery after index hospitalization'
- 'Step 5: Patients with higher comorbidity burden experience higher rates of all-cause
  readmission (HR 1.16), HF-related readmission (HR 1.13), and non-HF-related readmission
  (HR 1.17)'

description: 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 studies (39 in pooled analysis)
  demonstrates that comorbidity burden in heart failure patients significantly increases
  hospital readmission risk. The pooled hazard ratio for all-cause readmission is
  1.16 (95% CI 1.09-1.23), with similar effects for HF-related (HR 1.13) and non-HF-related
  readmission (HR 1.17). Ten specific comorbidities were identified as having negative
  effects on prognostic outcomes: diabetes, COPD, CKD, stroke, IHD, anemia, cancer,
  atrial fibrillation, dementia, and depression.'
