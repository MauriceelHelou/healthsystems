direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Diabetes mellitus creates chronic hyperglycemic state that impairs immune
  function and promotes systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Impaired immune response leads to reduced lymphocyte count (lymphopenia)
  and compromised viral clearance in COVID-19 infection'
- 'Step 3: Diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulable state contribute
  to reduced platelet count and elevated D-dimer levels'
- 'Step 4: These combined factors (immune dysfunction, inflammation, and coagulopathy)
  increase risk of severe COVID-19 complications including acute respiratory distress
  syndrome'
- 'Step 5: The synergistic effects of metabolic dysregulation and COVID-19-induced
  pathology result in increased mortality risk in hospitalized patients'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 87 studies (35,486 patients,
  5,867 deaths) found that diabetes mellitus was the best predictor of mortality in
  COVID-19 hospitalized patients after adjustment for confounders. The relationship
  operates through multiple biological pathways including immune dysfunction (reduced
  lymphocyte count), coagulation abnormalities (reduced platelet count, increased
  D-dimer), and metabolic dysregulation. The effect was age- and sex-dependent, and
  varied by geographic region.
