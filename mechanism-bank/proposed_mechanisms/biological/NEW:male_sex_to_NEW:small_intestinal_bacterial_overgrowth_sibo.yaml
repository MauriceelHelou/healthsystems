direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Male sex is associated with higher prevalence of non-alcoholic liver diseases
  (NAFLD, NASH, fibrosis, cirrhosis)'
- 'Step 2: In populations with chronic non-alcoholic liver diseases, higher percentage
  of males correlates with increased SIBO prevalence'
- 'Step 3: Potential mechanisms may include sex-specific differences in gut motility,
  bile acid metabolism, immune responses, or hormonal influences on intestinal microbiota
  regulation'
- 'Step 4: Meta-regression demonstrates that male sex is a predisposing factor toward
  SIBO development in liver disease populations'

description: Meta-regression analysis of 18 studies (n=1,263 patients) found that
  higher percentage of males in populations with non-alcoholic liver diseases is a
  significant predisposing factor toward SIBO. The overall SIBO prevalence in these
  populations was 35%, and this prevalence increases with the proportion of men in
  the study population. The regression coefficient of 0.0195 indicates that for each
  percentage point increase in male proportion, there is a corresponding increase
  in SIBO event rate.
