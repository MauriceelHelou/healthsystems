direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term inhalation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) leads to chronic exposure
  of airway epithelium to this reactive oxidant gas'
- 'Step 2: NO2 induces oxidative stress and inflammation in the respiratory tract,
  causing cellular damage and inflammatory responses in bronchial and alveolar tissues'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation promotes airway remodeling, impaired mucociliary clearance,
  and increased susceptibility to respiratory infections'
- 'Step 4: Progressive damage contributes to development or exacerbation of chronic
  respiratory conditions including COPD and acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI)'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated respiratory damage and disease progression increases risk of
  respiratory disease mortality'

description: Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide is associated with increased respiratory
  disease mortality, including deaths from COPD and acute lower respiratory infections.
  This meta-analysis of 83 studies provides high certainty evidence for the association,
  with GRADE assessment indicating high certainty for NO2 associations with COPD and
  ALRI mortality specifically.
