direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pediatric cancer diagnosis initiates treatment protocols including chemotherapy,
  radiation, or immunosuppressive therapies that compromise immune function'
- 'Step 2: Cancer and its treatments cause immunosuppression, reducing the body''s
  ability to mount effective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 3: Immunocompromised state increases vulnerability to more severe COVID-19
  manifestations requiring hospitalization for monitoring and supportive care'
- 'Step 4: Underlying cancer-related complications (neutropenia, lymphopenia) and
  treatment side effects may necessitate hospitalization as a precautionary measure
  even with mild COVID-19 symptoms'

description: Pediatric patients with cancer who contract COVID-19 have increased hospitalization
  rates compared to the general pediatric population due to immunocompromised status
  from both the malignancy and cancer treatments. However, this meta-analysis found
  no statistically significant difference in hospitalization risk between different
  cancer types, and overall survival remained very high (99.4%) in this population.

  description: No statistically significant difference found between hematological
    malignancies and solid tumors for hospitalization risk (OR=2.94, 95% CI 0.48-18.3),
    though point estimate suggests slightly higher risk for hematological cancers
