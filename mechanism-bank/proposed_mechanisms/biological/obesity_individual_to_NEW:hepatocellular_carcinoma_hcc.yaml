  and metabolic dysfunction in the liver'
- 'Step 3: These metabolic disturbances can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
  (NASH) with cycles of cell death and regeneration'
- 'Step 4: Obesity-related factors (insulin resistance, adipokine dysregulation, chronic
  inflammation) can directly promote hepatocyte malignant transformation independent
  of cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: Up to 38% of NASH-related HCC cases occur without significant underlying
  fibrosis, indicating obesity can drive carcinogenesis through non-fibrotic pathways'

description: Obesity promotes hepatocellular carcinoma through multiple pathways.
  The traditional pathway involves progression from hepatic steatosis to NASH, followed
  by cirrhosis and eventual malignant transformation. However, emerging evidence demonstrates
  that a substantial proportion (up to 38%) of obesity-related HCC cases develop without
  significant underlying fibrosis or cirrhosis. This suggests obesity-related metabolic
  dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and cellular stress can directly promote hepatocyte
  malignant transformation independent of the traditional fibrosis-cirrhosis-cancer
  sequence.
