  node_name: Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) Blood Level
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption results in sustained presence of ethanol
  in the bloodstream'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol reacts with phosphatidylcholine in cell membranes via phospholipase
  D enzyme, forming phosphatidylethanol (PEth) as a direct metabolite'
- 'Step 3: PEth accumulates in red blood cell membranes due to its long half-life
  (approximately 4 weeks), serving as a cumulative biomarker'
- 'Step 4: Higher alcohol intake (>60 g/day) results in significantly elevated PEth
  concentrations (mean 3.897 μM) compared to social drinkers (mean 0.288 μM)'

description: Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is formed directly from the reaction between
  ethanol and phosphatidylcholine catalyzed by phospholipase D. This systematic review
  and meta-analysis of 12 studies demonstrates that PEth concentrations are significantly
  elevated in chronic heavy drinkers compared to social drinkers, with heavy drinkers
  showing mean concentrations of 3.897 μM versus 0.288 μM in social drinkers. PEth
  accumulates in red blood cell membranes and has a long half-life, making it an effective
  biomarker for detecting chronic heavy alcohol consumption and potentially binge
  drinking behaviors.
