direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs during hospitalization, causing rapid
  decline in kidney function with reduced glomerular filtration rate and accumulation
  of metabolic waste products'
- 'Step 2: Severe AKI leads to life-threatening complications including hyperkalemia,
  metabolic acidosis, fluid overload, and uremic toxicity that cannot be managed with
  conservative measures alone'
- 'Step 3: When kidney function deteriorates beyond a critical threshold (typically
  Stage 3 AKI or failure to respond to medical management), renal replacement therapy
  (RRT) becomes necessary to artificially filter blood and maintain homeostasis'
- 'Step 4: Among critically ill hospitalized patients with AKI, approximately 20%
  require initiation of RRT (hemodialysis, continuous renal replacement therapy, or
  peritoneal dialysis)'

description: Acute kidney injury during hospitalization directly leads to renal replacement
  therapy when kidney function deteriorates to the point where the body cannot maintain
  fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base homeostasis. Among critically ill hospitalized
  patients, approximately 51% develop AKI, and of these, about 20% require RRT. The
  progression from AKI to RRT is driven by the severity of kidney dysfunction and
  is modulated by factors such as hemodynamic instability and shock requiring vasopressor
  support.
