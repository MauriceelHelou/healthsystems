direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis use disorder involves chronic exposure to cannabinoids, particularly
  THC, which binds to CB1 receptors in the brain'
- 'Step 2: Chronic cannabinoid exposure disrupts the endocannabinoid system, affecting
  dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in brain regions involved in psychosis
  and mood regulation'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes, combined with potential genetic vulnerabilities,
  increase susceptibility to developing serious mental illnesses including schizophrenia,
  psychotic disorders, and severe mood disorders'

description: Cannabis use disorder is strongly associated with serious mental illness,
  particularly schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. A systematic review of 37 studies
  found high rates of comorbid CUD among individuals with mental illness, with males
  showing 2.6 times higher odds of having CUD comorbid with schizophrenia compared
  to females. The relationship appears bidirectional, with mental illness increasing
  CUD risk in females for most conditions except psychotic disorders and depression.

  description: Males are approximately 2.6 times more likely than females to have
    CUD comorbid with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However, among
    females, mental illness generally increases the likelihood of having CUD, suggesting
    bidirectional vulnerability patterns that differ by sex.

  description: The association between CUD and SMI varies by diagnosis type - strongest
    for schizophrenia and psychotic disorders (OR ~2.6), moderate for mood and substance
    use disorders (OR 1-2.2), and reversed for anxiety and antisocial personality
    disorder
