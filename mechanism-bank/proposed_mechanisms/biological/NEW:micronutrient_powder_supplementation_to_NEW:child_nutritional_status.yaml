direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Micronutrient powders (MNPs) containing essential vitamins and minerals
  (iron, zinc, vitamin A, etc.) are added to home-prepared complementary foods for
  young children'
- 'Step 2: Home fortification increases the bioavailability and intake of critical
  micronutrients that may be deficient in local diets'
- 'Step 3: Improved micronutrient absorption supports hematopoiesis, immune function,
  and cellular metabolism'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced micronutrient status reduces risk of anemia, improves growth parameters,
  and supports overall nutritional status in children'

description: Home fortification with micronutrient powders (MNPs) involves adding
  sachets containing essential vitamins and minerals to complementary foods prepared
  at home for young children. This formative research study examined the acceptability,
  utilization, and promotion of an MNP program in São Tomé and Príncipe to improve
  child nutritional status by addressing micronutrient deficiencies common in low-resource
  settings.
