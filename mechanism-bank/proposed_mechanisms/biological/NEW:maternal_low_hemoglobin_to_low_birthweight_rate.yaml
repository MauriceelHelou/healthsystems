direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low maternal hemoglobin (<110 g/L) reduces oxygen-carrying capacity of
  maternal blood'
- 'Step 2: Decreased oxygen delivery to placenta impairs placental function and nutrient
  transfer'
- 'Step 3: Reduced oxygen and nutrient supply to fetus restricts fetal growth'
- 'Step 4: Chronic fetal hypoxia and nutrient restriction results in low birthweight
  (<2500g)'

description: 'Low maternal hemoglobin concentration (<110 g/L) during pregnancy is
  significantly associated with increased risk of low birthweight. This meta-analysis
  of 148 studies found an OR of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.22-1.35) for LBW, with even stronger
  effects for very low birthweight (OR 2.15). The biological mechanism involves reduced
  oxygen-carrying capacity leading to fetal hypoxia and growth restriction. Effects
  are stronger when anemia occurs earlier in pregnancy and with more severe anemia.'
