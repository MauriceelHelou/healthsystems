category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to and downregulates ACE2 receptors on endothelial
  cells and cardiomyocytes, disrupting normal cardiovascular homeostasis'
- 'Step 2: COVID-19 triggers systemic inflammation with increased levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (cytokine storm), causing widespread endothelial dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Endothelial dysfunction combined with COVID-19-induced pro-coagulant status
  increases thrombotic risk in coronary arteries'
- 'Step 4: The combination of inflammation, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability
  promotes plaque instability and coronary thrombosis, leading to acute myocardial
  infarction'
- 'Step 5: Elevated myocardial biomarkers (troponin I, NT-proBNP) indicate direct
  myocardial injury from viral infection and immune-mediated damage'

description: COVID-19 infection increases acute myocardial infarction risk through
  multiple pathological mechanisms including ACE2 receptor downregulation, endothelial
  dysfunction, pro-coagulant state, and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mortality
  in patients with concurrent COVID-19 and AMI is substantially elevated (10-76%)
  compared to AMI patients without COVID-19 (4.6-7%). Cardiovascular event risk remains
  elevated even after the acute phase of COVID-19, indicating persistent vascular
  damage.
