direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM10 particles leads to deposition in the respiratory tract,
  with smaller particles capable of reaching alveoli and entering systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: PM10 exposure triggers systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial
  dysfunction, which are key pathophysiological processes affecting cardiovascular
  health'
- 'Step 3: Chronic and acute inflammatory responses contribute to myocardial stress,
  altered cardiac function, and exacerbation of underlying cardiovascular conditions'
- 'Step 4: These physiological changes increase the risk of heart failure events including
  new-onset heart failure, hospitalizations for acute decompensation, and cardiovascular
  mortality'

description: 'A comprehensive meta-analysis of 100 studies across 20 countries demonstrated
  that both short-term and long-term PM10 exposure are adversely associated with heart
  failure risk. Short-term exposure showed a 1.6% increased risk of heart failure
  per 10-μg/m3 increment in PM10 (RR=1.016, 95% CI: 1.011-1.020), while long-term
  exposure demonstrated a 21.2% increased risk per 10-μg/m3 increment (RR=1.212, 95%
  CI: 1.010-1.454). The biological mechanism involves PM10-induced systemic inflammation,
  oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiac stress and heart
  failure events.'

  strength: strong
  description: Long-term exposure (RR=1.212 per 10-μg/m3) showed stronger associations
    than short-term exposure (RR=1.016 per 10-μg/m3)
- name: Lag time

  strength: weak
  description: Positive associations were stronger when exposure was considered over
    the previous 2 days (lag 0-1) rather than on the day of exposure only (lag 0)
