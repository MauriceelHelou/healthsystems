direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior episodes of delirium tremens indicate previous severe neuroadaptation
  to chronic alcohol exposure, with significant alterations to GABA and glutamate
  receptor systems'
- 'Step 2: The kindling phenomenon occurs whereby each successive alcohol withdrawal
  episode leads to progressive sensitization of neural circuits, lowering the threshold
  for subsequent severe withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological changes from prior delirium tremens episodes persist, including
  altered autonomic nervous system regulation and increased excitatory neurotransmission
  vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Upon alcohol cessation, the pre-sensitized nervous system exhibits an exaggerated
  hyperexcitable response, manifesting as severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome including
  seizures and recurrent delirium tremens'

description: History of delirium tremens significantly increases the likelihood of
  developing severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (SAWS) by nearly 3-fold. This systematic
  review of 14 high-quality studies with over 71,000 patients found that prior delirium
  tremens is one of the most predictive clinical indicators for SAWS, reflecting the
  kindling phenomenon whereby previous severe withdrawal episodes sensitize neural
  circuits to future withdrawal.
