direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NAFLD develops from hepatic fat accumulation, often driven by insulin resistance
  and metabolic dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: The diseased liver exhibits impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, exacerbating
  systemic insulin resistance'
- 'Step 3: Hepatic inflammation and altered adipokine/hepatokine secretion promote
  dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance'
- 'Step 4: These metabolic derangements collectively manifest as new-onset metabolic
  syndrome components (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes)'
- 'Step 5: The incidence rate of metabolic syndrome in NAFLD patients is 25.4 per
  1,000 person-years, indicating substantial progression to full metabolic syndrome'

description: NAFLD significantly increases the incidence of metabolic syndrome, with
  a pooled incidence rate of 25.4 per 1,000 person-years. This meta-analysis of 79
  studies (1,377,466 persons) demonstrates that NAFLD promotes the development of
  metabolic syndrome components including hypertension (25.8/1,000 PY), dyslipidemia
  (26.4/1,000 PY), and diabetes (19.0/1,000 PY). The bidirectional relationship between
  hepatic steatosis and systemic metabolic dysfunction creates a progressive cycle
  of metabolic deterioration.
