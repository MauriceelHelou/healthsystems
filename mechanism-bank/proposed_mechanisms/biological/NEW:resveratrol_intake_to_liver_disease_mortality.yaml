direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Resveratrol intake provides antioxidative properties that reduce oxidative
  stress in hepatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Reduced oxidative stress leads to decreased hepatic inflammation, necrosis,
  and apoptosis'
- 'Step 3: Resveratrol improves insulin resistance and lipid profile, reducing hepatic
  steatosis (fatty liver)'
- 'Step 4: Decreased steatosis and inflammation result in reduced hepatic fibrosis
  progression'
- 'Step 5: Prevention of fibrosis and improved liver function reduces progression
  to cirrhosis and liver failure'
- 'Step 6: Improved liver health and reduced disease severity leads to decreased liver
  disease mortality'

description: Resveratrol intake reduces liver disease mortality through multiple hepatoprotective
  mechanisms including antioxidant effects, reduction of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis,
  improvement of glucose metabolism and lipid profiles, and protection against ischemia-induced
  liver damage. The compound significantly increases survival after liver transplantation
  and decreases fat deposition, necrosis, and apoptosis in liver tissue.
