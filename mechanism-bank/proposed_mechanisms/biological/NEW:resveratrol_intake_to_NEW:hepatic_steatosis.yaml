  node_name: Hepatic Steatosis (Fatty Liver)
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Resveratrol intake activates SIRT1 and AMPK signaling pathways in hepatocytes'
- 'Step 2: AMPK activation enhances fatty acid oxidation and suppresses lipogenesis
  in the liver'
- 'Step 3: Resveratrol improves insulin sensitivity, reducing hyperinsulinemia-driven
  hepatic de novo lipogenesis'
- 'Step 4: Modulation of lipid profile occurs through decreased triglyceride synthesis
  and increased cholesterol efflux'
- 'Step 5: Antioxidative properties reduce oxidative stress-mediated lipid peroxidation
  and hepatocyte damage'
- 'Step 6: Combined effects result in decreased fat deposition and reduced hepatic
  steatosis'

description: 'Resveratrol reduces hepatic steatosis through multiple interconnected
  mechanisms: improving insulin resistance, modulating lipid metabolism, and exerting
  antioxidative effects. This systematic review of 76 preclinical studies demonstrates
  that resveratrol decreases fat deposition in hepatocytes, improves glucose metabolism
  and lipid profiles, and alters hepatic cell fatty acid composition. The compound
  activates metabolic regulators like SIRT1 and AMPK, which enhance fatty acid oxidation
  while suppressing lipogenesis, ultimately reducing hepatic fat accumulation.'
