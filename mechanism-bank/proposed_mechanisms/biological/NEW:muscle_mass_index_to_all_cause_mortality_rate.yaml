category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher quantitative muscle mass index reflects greater skeletal muscle
  reserves and metabolic capacity'
- 'Step 2: Adequate muscle mass supports protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, immune
  function, and functional independence'
- 'Step 3: Preserved muscle mass maintains physiological resilience against catabolic
  stressors and disease complications'
- 'Step 4: Greater muscle reserves provide buffer against nutritional depletion and
  systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 5: Reduced risk of sarcopenia-related complications (infections, falls, functional
  decline) decreases mortality risk'

description: Higher quantitative muscle mass index (per unit increase) is associated
  with a 5% reduction in mortality risk (aHR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.98). This meta-analysis
  of 22 studies with 6,965 cirrhosis patients demonstrates that preserved muscle mass
  independently protects against mortality. The continuous relationship between muscle
  mass and survival supports the biological importance of skeletal muscle as a metabolic
  organ that provides physiological reserves, supports immune function, and maintains
  functional capacity under disease stress.
