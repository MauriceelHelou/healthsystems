mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic liver diseases (HBV, HCV, alcohol-related liver disease) cause
  persistent hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte injury'
- 'Step 2: When metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) coexists
  with these conditions (mixed-MAFLD), additive or synergistic liver damage occurs
  through combined inflammatory, metabolic, and viral/toxic pathways'
- 'Step 3: The combined insults accelerate fibrogenesis and progression to cirrhosis,
  with mixed-MAFLD HCC showing significantly higher likelihood of cirrhosis compared
  to single-etiology MAFLD'
- 'Step 4: Cirrhotic liver provides the permissive environment for hepatocarcinogenesis
  through altered cell proliferation, oxidative stress, and impaired tumor surveillance'
- 'Step 5: The synergistic hepatotoxic effects result in high HCC incidence, with
  MAFLD prevalence reaching 40% in HBV-related, 54% in HCV-related, and 64% in alcohol-related
  HCC cases'

description: Concurrent chronic liver diseases (HBV, HCV, alcohol-related liver disease)
  substantially increase hepatocellular carcinoma incidence, particularly when combined
  with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease. This systematic review
  of 22 studies (56,565 HCC patients) found that nearly half of all HCC cases had
  MAFLD as a contributing factor, with mixed-etiology cases being more common than
  single-etiology MAFLD-HCC. The synergistic effect of concurrent liver diseases accelerates
  progression to cirrhosis and subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis.
