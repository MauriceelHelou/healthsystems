direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Schizophrenia involves neurobiological dysfunction including dopaminergic
  dysregulation, prefrontal cortex abnormalities, and disrupted neural circuitry affecting
  cognition and emotion regulation'
- 'Step 2: These neurobiological changes contribute to positive symptoms (hallucinations,
  delusions), negative symptoms (anhedonia, social withdrawal), and cognitive deficits
  that impair functioning and quality of life'
- 'Step 3: The chronic nature of the illness, combined with awareness of functional
  decline and social consequences, contributes to psychological distress and hopelessness'
- 'Step 4: Command hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and insight into illness
  severity can directly precipitate suicidal thoughts as escape from suffering or
  response to psychotic content'
- 'Step 5: High rates of suicidal ideation manifest, with approximately 30-35% lifetime
  prevalence and similar point prevalence among individuals with schizophrenia'

description: Schizophrenia diagnosis is strongly associated with suicidal ideation,
  with approximately one-third of individuals with schizophrenia experiencing suicidal
  thoughts during their lifetime. This meta-analysis of 26 studies covering 5,079
  individuals found lifetime prevalence of 34.5% and point prevalence of 29.9% for
  suicidal ideation. The relationship is driven by neurobiological aspects of the
  illness including psychotic symptoms, cognitive impairment, and awareness of functional
  decline. Males and inpatients show particularly elevated risk.
