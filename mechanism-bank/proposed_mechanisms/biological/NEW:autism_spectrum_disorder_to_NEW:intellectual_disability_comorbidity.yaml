direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves neurodevelopmental alterations
  affecting brain structure and function during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Shared genetic and neurobiological risk factors between ASD and intellectual
  disability lead to overlapping developmental pathways affecting cognitive functioning'
- 'Step 3: Disruptions in synaptic development, neural connectivity, and brain region
  specialization contribute to cognitive impairments in a subset of individuals with
  ASD'
- 'Step 4: Approximately 22.9% of children and adolescents with ASD in population-based
  samples meet criteria for comorbid intellectual disability/intellectual developmental
  disorder'

description: Meta-analysis of 39 population-based studies demonstrates that approximately
  22.9% of children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder have comorbid intellectual
  disability. This co-occurrence reflects shared neurodevelopmental mechanisms, including
  genetic risk factors and disruptions in brain development affecting cognitive functioning.
  Population-based estimates are lower than clinical samples, indicating that referral
  bias inflates comorbidity rates in treatment settings.
