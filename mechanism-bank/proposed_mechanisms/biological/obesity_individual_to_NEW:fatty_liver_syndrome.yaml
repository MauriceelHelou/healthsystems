direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Obesity leads to excess adipose tissue accumulation, resulting in increased
  circulating free fatty acids and chronic low-grade inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Elevated free fatty acids are taken up by hepatocytes, exceeding the liver''s
  capacity for fatty acid oxidation and export'
- 'Step 3: Excess lipids accumulate as triglycerides within hepatocytes, leading to
  hepatic steatosis (fatty liver)'
- 'Step 4: Continued lipid accumulation and associated oxidative stress can progress
  to hepatic fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis'

description: Obesity is a primary driver of fatty liver syndrome, as the high prevalence
  of obesity is directly linked to the emerging global health problem of fatty liver
  disease. The accumulation of excess adipose tissue leads to increased lipid deposition
  in the liver, which can progress to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis over time.
