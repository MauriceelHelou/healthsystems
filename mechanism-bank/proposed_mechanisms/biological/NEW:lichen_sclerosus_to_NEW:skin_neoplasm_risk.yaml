direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lichen sclerosus causes chronic inflammatory changes in affected skin,
  characterized by persistent immune cell infiltration and cytokine release'
- 'Step 2: Ongoing inflammation leads to repeated cycles of tissue damage, repair,
  and cellular proliferation in the affected epithelium'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammatory microenvironment promotes DNA damage, oxidative stress,
  and genomic instability in keratinocytes'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic alterations and persistent proliferative signaling
  increase risk of malignant transformation, particularly squamous cell carcinoma'

description: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that increases
  risk of skin neoplasms as a recognized complication. The systematic review of 900
  studies documented skin neoplasms among the LS-associated complications in both
  men and women. The chronic inflammatory state characteristic of LS creates conditions
  favorable for malignant transformation through sustained tissue damage, repair cycles,
  and genomic instability.
