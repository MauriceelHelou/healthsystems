direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Deficiency in key vitamins (A, C, D, E, B vitamins) reduces antioxidant
  capacity and impairs cellular defense mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Reduced antioxidant capacity leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and lipid peroxidation products, creating a lipotoxic cellular environment'
- 'Step 3: Oxidative stress triggers activation of inflammatory pathways and immune
  system dysregulation'
- 'Step 4: Unwarranted inflammation develops as the body fails to neutralize oxidative
  damage, contributing to tissue damage and disease progression'

description: Vitamin deficiency contributes to oxidative stress and inflammation through
  multiple interconnected pathways. Deficiency in antioxidant vitamins (A, C, E) directly
  impairs the body's ability to neutralize reactive oxygen species. Vitamin D deficiency
  affects immune regulation and inflammatory responses. B vitamin deficiencies contribute
  to metabolic dysfunction and altered cellular defense mechanisms. Together, these
  deficiencies create a lipotoxic hepatic environment characterized by unwarranted
  inflammation, oxidative stress, gene mutations, epigenetic modifications, and gut
  dysbiosis.
