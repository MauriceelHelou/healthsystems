direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (TMS/tDCS) deliver electrical
  or magnetic fields to targeted brain regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex'
- 'Step 2: These techniques modulate neural activity and excitability in circuits
  associated with executive function and impulse control'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced prefrontal cortical activity strengthens top-down inhibitory control
  over impulsive behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Improved impulse control manifests as reduced impulsivity scores on behavioral
  and self-report measures'

description: Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (TMS and tDCS) may reduce impulsivity
  in patients with mental disorders by modulating prefrontal cortical activity. While
  overall meta-analytic effects for both tDCS and rTMS were not statistically significant,
  subgroup analysis of tDCS studies using the BIS-11 showed a moderate effect favoring
  active stimulation over sham. Evidence remains insufficient to support clinical
  use, with variability in stimulation protocols, brain targets, and impulsivity conceptualization
  limiting conclusions.
