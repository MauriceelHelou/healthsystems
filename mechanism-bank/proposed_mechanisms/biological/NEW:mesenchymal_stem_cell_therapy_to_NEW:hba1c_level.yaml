mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are administered to patients with diabetes
  mellitus'
- 'Step 2: MSCs exhibit immunomodulatory properties that reduce inflammation and autoimmune
  attack on pancreatic beta cells'
- 'Step 3: MSCs may promote regeneration or preservation of functional beta cell mass
  through paracrine signaling'
- 'Step 4: Improved beta cell function leads to better insulin secretion and glucose
  regulation'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced glycemic control over time results in decreased glycation of hemoglobin,
  reducing HbA1c levels'

description: 'Meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials (413 participants) demonstrates
  that mesenchymal stem cell therapy significantly reduces HbA1c levels in patients
  with diabetes mellitus. The MSC treatment group showed a mean difference of -1.32%
  (95% CI: -2.06 to -0.57) in HbA1c reduction from baseline, and -0.87% (95% CI: -1.53
  to -0.22) compared to control groups. The therapy appears safe with no significant
  difference in adverse events between treatment and control groups, though hypoglycemia
  was the most common adverse reaction (29.95%).'
