direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive NAFLD involves accumulation of hepatic steatosis (fat in liver
  cells) that advances beyond simple fatty liver'
- 'Step 2: Progression leads to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) characterized
  by hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation triggers hepatic stellate cell activation and progressive
  fibrosis (scarring) of liver tissue'
- 'Step 4: Advanced fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis with loss of functional liver
  tissue and portal hypertension'
- 'Step 5: Cirrhotic liver leads to hepatic decompensation, liver failure, hepatocellular
  carcinoma, and ultimately death from liver disease'

description: Progressive non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) leads to liver
  disease mortality through a well-established pathophysiological cascade. Simple
  steatosis can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by
  hepatocyte injury and inflammation. This chronic inflammatory state activates fibrogenic
  pathways, leading to progressive fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis. Cirrhotic changes
  result in portal hypertension, hepatic decompensation, and increased risk of hepatocellular
  carcinoma, all contributing to liver-related mortality.
