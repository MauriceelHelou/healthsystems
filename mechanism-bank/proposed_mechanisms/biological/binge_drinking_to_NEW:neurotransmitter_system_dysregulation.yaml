direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking episodes cause acute alcohol intoxication, which triggers
  short-term alterations in multiple neurotransmitter systems including dopamine,
  corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), and glutamate'
- 'Step 2: With continued binge/intoxication cycles, repeated alcohol exposure leads
  to progressive dysregulation and alterations of these neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 3: Neurotransmitter dysregulation contributes to alterations in neural pathways
  connecting prefrontal and limbic structures, manifesting as dysfunctional behaviors
  and contributing to addiction development through the three-stage framework (binge/intoxication,
  withdrawal/negative affect, preoccupation/anticipation)'

description: Binge drinking causes progressive dysregulation of key neurotransmitter
  systems (dopamine, CRF, glutamate) that regulate reward, stress, and executive function.
  Initial alcohol exposure triggers acute effects on these systems, and with continued
  intoxication, the systems become chronically altered, contributing to the neurobiological
  basis of alcohol use disorder. This dysregulation affects neural pathways connecting
  prefrontal and limbic brain structures, driving the cycle of addiction.
