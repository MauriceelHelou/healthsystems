direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vitamin D deficiency (low 25(OH)D levels) impairs immune system regulation,
  affecting both innate and adaptive immune responses'
- 'Step 2: Reduced vitamin D leads to decreased production of antimicrobial peptides
  (cathelicidins and defensins) and impaired macrophage function, weakening initial
  viral defense'
- 'Step 3: Vitamin D deficiency promotes pro-inflammatory cytokine production and
  reduces anti-inflammatory cytokine synthesis, contributing to dysregulated inflammatory
  responses'
- 'Step 4: Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, the compromised immune regulation in vitamin
  D deficient individuals leads to excessive inflammation and potential cytokine storm'
- 'Step 5: This dysregulated immune response results in increased COVID-19 severity,
  including higher rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality'

description: Vitamin D deficiency is significantly associated with increased COVID-19
  severity. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 studies found that individuals
  with vitamin D deficiency had 2.57 times higher odds of experiencing severe COVID-19
  outcomes in adjusted analyses. The association was robust for composite severity
  measures but showed heterogeneity for specific outcomes like ICU admission and mortality
  depending on statistical methods used.
