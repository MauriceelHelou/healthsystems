mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Frailty represents a state of decreased physiological reserve characterized
  by sarcopenia, immune dysfunction, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and chronic low-grade
  inflammation'
- 'Step 2: These physiological deficits reduce the body''s capacity to maintain homeostasis
  and respond to acute stressors such as infections, injuries, or surgical procedures'
- 'Step 3: Frail individuals experience increased susceptibility to adverse health
  events including falls, bone fractures, disability, dementia, and hospitalization'
- 'Step 4: The accumulation of these adverse health outcomes, combined with reduced
  recovery capacity and increased vulnerability to complications, leads to significantly
  elevated mortality risk'

description: This meta-analysis of 29 prospective studies demonstrates that frailty
  significantly increases all-cause mortality risk in middle-aged and older adults.
  Frailty, characterized by accumulated physiological deficits, leads to vulnerability
  across multiple organ systems, increasing susceptibility to falls, fractures, disability,
  dementia, and hospitalization, which collectively contribute to elevated mortality.
  The relationship shows a gradient effect with frail individuals at highest risk
  compared to prefrail and robust groups.
