direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption in individuals with alcohol use disorder leads to ethanol
  metabolism via hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase and subsequent enzymatic pathways'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic byproducts are formed including direct ethanol metabolites (ethyl
  glucuronide, ethyl sulfate) and phospholipid adducts (phosphatidylethanol), which
  accumulate in blood, urine, hair, and other tissues'
- 'Step 3: These biomarkers persist in detectable quantities for varying time windows
  - urinary ethyl glucuronide/sulfate for days, phosphatidylethanol in blood for weeks,
  and hair ethyl glucuronide for months'
- 'Step 4: Laboratory assays can detect these biomarkers with high sensitivity (70-100%)
  and specificity (86-100%), enabling objective verification of alcohol consumption
  patterns'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to detectable biomarkers through ethanol metabolism.
  The body produces specific metabolites (ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate, phosphatidylethanol)
  that accumulate in various tissues and can be measured with high diagnostic accuracy.
  Urinary ethyl glucuronide shows 70-89% sensitivity and 93-99% specificity; phosphatidylethanol
  shows 73-100% sensitivity and 90-96% specificity; scalp hair ethyl glucuronide shows
  85-100% sensitivity and 97-100% specificity for detecting chronic excessive alcohol
  use.
