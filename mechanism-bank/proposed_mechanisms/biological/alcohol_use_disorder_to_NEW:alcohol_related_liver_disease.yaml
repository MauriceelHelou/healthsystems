direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption in individuals with alcohol use disorder
  leads to sustained hepatotoxic exposure'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism in the liver produces acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen
  species, causing oxidative stress and direct hepatocyte damage'
- 'Step 3: Repeated hepatic injury triggers inflammatory responses and activation
  of hepatic stellate cells'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrogenesis leads to liver fibrosis, with continued exposure
  resulting in cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: Advanced liver disease manifests with portal hypertension, hepatocellular
  carcinoma risk, and increased liver-related mortality'

description: Alcohol use disorder is a primary causative factor for alcohol-related
  liver disease. Systematic evidence demonstrates that individuals with AUD are at
  highest risk for developing ARLD, with screening studies identifying significant
  proportions of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in this population. The progression
  from AUD to ARLD involves chronic hepatotoxic exposure, leading to fibrosis and
  potentially cirrhosis. Detection rates of cirrhosis range from 10.8%-29.6% among
  hospitalized AUD patients, confirming the strong biological link between chronic
  excessive alcohol use and progressive liver disease.
