direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of NO2 leads to direct pulmonary oxidative stress and inflammation,
  with reactive nitrogen species causing damage to respiratory epithelium and triggering
  systemic inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 2: Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress promote endothelial dysfunction,
  reducing nitric oxide bioavailability and impairing vascular function'
- 'Step 3: Chronic endothelial dysfunction contributes to increased arterial stiffness,
  elevated blood pressure, and accelerated atherosclerosis, placing additional hemodynamic
  stress on the heart'
- 'Step 4: NO2 exposure activates autonomic nervous system imbalances, increasing
  sympathetic activity which elevates heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects of systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hemodynamic
  stress, and autonomic dysregulation lead to myocardial remodeling, reduced cardiac
  function, and ultimately increased risk of heart failure incidence, hospitalization,
  and mortality'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 100 studies across 20 countries demonstrates that
  NO2 exposure is significantly associated with increased heart failure risk. Long-term
  NO2 exposure showed a 20.4% increased risk of heart failure per 10-ppb increment
  (RR=1.204, 95% CI: 1.069-1.356). The biological mechanism involves NO2-induced oxidative
  stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic nervous system
  disruption, which collectively impair cardiac function and increase heart failure
  risk through hospitalization, incidence, and mortality outcomes.'

  description: Long-term exposure showed stronger associations (RR=1.204 per 10-ppb
    NO2) compared to short-term exposure effects
- name: Lag period
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: For short-term exposure, positive associations were stronger when exposure
    was considered over previous 2 days (lag 0-1) rather than on day of exposure only
    (lag 0)
