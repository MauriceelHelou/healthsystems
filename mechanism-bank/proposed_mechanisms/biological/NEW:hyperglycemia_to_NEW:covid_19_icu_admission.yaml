direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hyperglycemia impairs immune function, including reduced neutrophil chemotaxis,
  phagocytosis, and bactericidal activity, compromising the body''s ability to fight
  SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood glucose creates a pro-inflammatory state and enhances viral
  replication, leading to more severe COVID-19 disease progression'
- 'Step 3: Hyperglycemia promotes endothelial dysfunction and a hypercoagulable state,
  contributing to multi-organ complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome'
- 'Step 4: The combination of impaired immune response, increased inflammation, and
  end-organ damage results in disease severity requiring intensive care unit admission'

description: 'Meta-analysis of 8 observational studies including 1,447 hyperglycemic
  and 1,282 normoglycemic COVID-19 patients demonstrated that hyperglycemia is associated
  with increased ICU admission rates. Among all hyperglycemic patients, 11% required
  ICU admission (CI: 0.05-0.19). Non-diabetic patients with hyperglycemia had higher
  risk of ICU admission compared to normoglycemic patients. The analysis supports
  hyperglycemia as a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes requiring intensive
  care.'

  description: Among diabetic COVID-19 patients with hyperglycemia, 15% required ICU
    admission compared to 5% in non-diabetic hyperglycemic patients, suggesting diabetes
    status may modify the relationship between hyperglycemia and ICU admission
