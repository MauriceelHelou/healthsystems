direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic liver disease impairs hepatic function, reducing the liver''s ability
  to synthesize proteins essential for immune response and coagulation'
- 'Step 2: Compromised liver function leads to dysregulated immune responses, including
  impaired cytokine regulation and reduced ability to clear pathogens'
- 'Step 3: Pre-existing liver inflammation and fibrosis create a hyperinflammatory
  state that amplifies COVID-19-induced systemic inflammation (cytokine storm)'
- 'Step 4: Impaired hepatic clearance of inflammatory mediators and metabolic dysfunction
  contribute to multi-organ failure in severe COVID-19'
- 'Step 5: Combined hepatic dysfunction and COVID-19 infection result in significantly
  increased risk of severe disease progression and death'

description: Chronic liver disease significantly increases the risk of COVID-19 mortality,
  with patients having 2.35 times higher odds of death compared to those without CLD.
  This meta-analysis of 40 studies involving over 900,000 participants demonstrates
  that pre-existing hepatic dysfunction compromises immune responses and exacerbates
  the inflammatory cascade triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
