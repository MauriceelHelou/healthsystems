mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using techniques such as transient elastography,
  magnetic resonance elastography, or shear wave elastography quantifies the degree
  of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Elevated LSM values (particularly >20-25 kPa) reflect advanced fibrosis
  with increased extracellular matrix deposition, collagen cross-linking, and architectural
  distortion of liver parenchyma'
- 'Step 3: Higher liver stiffness correlates with portal hypertension development
  due to increased intrahepatic vascular resistance'
- 'Step 4: Portal hypertension leads to hepatic decompensation events including variceal
  bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome'
- 'Step 5: Decompensation events and progressive liver dysfunction increase mortality
  risk in patients with chronic liver disease'

description: Liver stiffness measurement serves as a dynamic, non-invasive biomarker
  that reflects the degree of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. Higher LSM values, particularly
  above 20-25 kPa, demonstrate strong predictive power for hepatic decompensation
  and mortality in patients with alcohol-related liver disease. The mechanism operates
  through LSM's quantification of structural liver damage, which correlates with portal
  hypertension development and subsequent decompensation events that drive mortality.
