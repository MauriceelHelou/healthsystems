- 'Step 1: SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to and downregulates ACE2 receptors on cardiac and
  vascular endothelial cells'
- 'Step 2: Downregulation of ACE2 leads to endothelial dysfunction and impaired vascular
  homeostasis'
- 'Step 3: COVID-19 infection triggers a hyperinflammatory state with elevated pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (cytokine storm)'
- 'Step 4: The inflammatory cascade promotes a pro-coagulant status increasing thrombosis
  risk'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects lead to myocardial injury evidenced by elevated cardiac
  biomarkers (troponin I, NT-proBNP)'
- 'Step 6: Acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction) occur at higher
  rates during and after COVID-19 infection'
- 'Step 7: Patients with COVID-19 and acute myocardial infarction experience significantly
  higher mortality (10-76%) compared to non-COVID AMI patients (4.6-7%)'

description: COVID-19 infection increases cardiovascular disease mortality through
  multiple interconnected biological mechanisms. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes downregulation
  of ACE2 receptors, leading to endothelial dysfunction. The infection triggers a
  hyperinflammatory state with elevated cytokines and creates a pro-coagulant status
  that increases thrombosis risk. These factors combine to cause direct myocardial
  injury, evidenced by elevated cardiac biomarkers. COVID-19 survivors show increased
  risk of cardiovascular events even after the acute phase. Mortality rates for AMI
  patients with COVID-19 (10-76%) are dramatically higher than for non-COVID AMI patients
  (4.6-7%).
