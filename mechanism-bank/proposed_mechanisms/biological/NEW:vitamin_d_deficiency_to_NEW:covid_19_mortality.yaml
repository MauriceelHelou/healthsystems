  node_id: NEW:covid_19_mortality
  node_name: COVID-19 Mortality
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vitamin D deficiency (low 25(OH)D levels) impairs immune system function,
  reducing the body''s ability to mount effective antiviral responses'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate vitamin D leads to dysregulated inflammatory responses, potentially
  contributing to cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 cases'
- 'Step 3: Compromised immune function and excessive inflammation increase disease
  severity, leading to respiratory complications and multi-organ failure'
- 'Step 4: Severe disease progression results in increased mortality risk among COVID-19
  patients with vitamin D deficiency'

description: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 studies found that vitamin
  D deficiency is significantly associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Studies
  using Cox survival analysis showed the strongest association (HR: 7.67; 95% CI:
  3.92-15.03), while crude analyses also showed significant effects (OR: 2.62). However,
  adjusted logistic regression studies showed inconsistent results, indicating some
  heterogeneity in methodological approaches.'
