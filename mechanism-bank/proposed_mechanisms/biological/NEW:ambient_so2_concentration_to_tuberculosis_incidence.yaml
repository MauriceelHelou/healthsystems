  node_id: tuberculosis_incidence
  node_name: Pulmonary Tuberculosis Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of ambient SO2 causes direct irritation and damage to the respiratory
  epithelium, compromising the mucosal barrier function'
- 'Step 2: SO2 exposure triggers oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the
  lungs, impairing local immune defenses including alveolar macrophage function'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure leads to impaired mucociliary clearance and reduced ability
  to eliminate pathogens from the respiratory tract'
- 'Step 4: Compromised pulmonary immune function increases susceptibility to Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis infection and progression from latent to active tuberculosis'

description: Meta-analysis of 9 studies demonstrates that for every 10 μg/m³ increment
  in ambient SO2 concentration, there is an 8% increased risk of pulmonary tuberculosis
  incidence. SO2 exposure compromises respiratory immune defenses through oxidative
  stress, epithelial damage, and impaired macrophage function, increasing susceptibility
  to TB infection and disease progression.
