to_node:
  node_id: low_birthweight_rate
  node_name: Low Birthweight Rate
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Combustion of solid biomass fuels (wood, charcoal, dung, crop residues)
  for cooking, heating, and lighting releases fine particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon
  monoxide (CO), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other toxic pollutants into
  the household environment'
- 'Step 2: Pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries experience high exposure
  levels due to time spent near cooking fires and poorly ventilated housing conditions'
- 'Step 3: Inhaled pollutants cross the placental barrier and enter fetal circulation,
  while carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin reducing oxygen delivery to the fetus'
- 'Step 4: Systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired placental function
  result from chronic pollutant exposure during pregnancy'
- 'Step 5: These physiological disruptions lead to intrauterine growth restriction
  and reduced fetal development, resulting in low birthweight (<2500g)'

description: Household air pollution from solid biomass fuel combustion exposes pregnant
  women to high levels of fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide, which impair
  fetal oxygen delivery and placental function through inflammatory and oxidative
  stress pathways, leading to intrauterine growth restriction and low birthweight
  outcomes.
