direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The PNPLA3 rs738409 C>G polymorphism results in an isoleucine to methionine
  substitution at position 148 (I148M) in the adiponutrin/PNPLA3 protein'
- 'Step 2: The I148M variant impairs the normal lipase activity of PNPLA3, reducing
  its ability to hydrolyze triglycerides in hepatocytes'
- 'Step 3: Impaired lipid metabolism leads to increased hepatic lipid accumulation
  and steatosis, particularly under conditions of alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 4: The combination of alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and genetically-impaired
  lipid handling creates synergistic hepatocellular stress and inflammation'
- 'Step 5: Progressive liver injury through an additive genetic model leads to increased
  risk of alcoholic liver disease, particularly alcoholic liver cirrhosis'

description: The PNPLA3 rs738409 G allele (I148M variant) significantly increases
  the risk of alcoholic liver disease, particularly alcoholic liver cirrhosis. This
  meta-analysis of 11 studies (3,495 ALD patients and 5,038 controls) demonstrates
  a clear association following an additive genetic model, where homozygous GG carriers
  have over 4-fold increased odds of alcoholic liver cirrhosis compared to CC carriers,
  while heterozygous GC carriers have approximately 2-fold increased risk.
