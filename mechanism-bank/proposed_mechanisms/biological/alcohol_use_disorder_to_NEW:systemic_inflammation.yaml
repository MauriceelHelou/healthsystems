direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption causes direct damage to the gut epithelium,
  increasing intestinal permeability (leaky gut) and allowing bacterial endotoxins
  (lipopolysaccharides) to enter systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism in the liver generates reactive oxygen species and acetaldehyde,
  triggering hepatic immune responses and Kupffer cell activation, leading to production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6)'
- 'Step 3: Circulatory cytokines and neuroimmune mediators from peripheral inflammation
  cross the blood-brain barrier or signal through afferent pathways, activating central
  nervous system immune responses'
- 'Step 4: Chronic alcohol exposure attenuates microglial compensatory mechanisms
  and promotes sustained neuroinflammation, contributing to systemic and central inflammatory
  states'

description: Alcohol use disorder provokes systemic inflammation through multiple
  converging pathways. Chronic heavy drinking triggers peripheral immune responses
  through liver damage and gut barrier disruption, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines
  into circulation. These circulatory mediators signal to the brain through afferent
  immune-to-brain pathways. Additionally, alcohol directly impacts central nervous
  system immune function, initially prompting compensatory microglial responses that
  become attenuated with chronic exposure, leading to sustained neuroinflammation
  and systemic inflammatory dysregulation.
