  node_id: elevated_inflammatory_markers_crp
  node_name: Elevated Inflammatory Markers (CRP)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gut microbiota metabolize dietary precursors (choline, carnitine, betaine)
  to produce trimethylamine (TMA)'
- 'Step 2: TMA is absorbed into circulation and oxidized by hepatic flavin-containing
  monooxygenases (FMO3) to form TMAO'
- 'Step 3: Elevated circulating TMAO activates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways
  in endothelial cells and immune cells'
- 'Step 4: TMAO promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NF-κB signaling, leading
  to increased production of inflammatory cytokines'
- 'Step 5: Sustained inflammatory activation results in elevated systemic inflammatory
  markers including C-reactive protein (CRP)'

description: Elevated circulating TMAO levels are positively correlated with inflammatory
  biomarkers in patients with chronic kidney disease. This meta-analysis of 21 studies
  demonstrated a moderate positive correlation (r=0.43) between TMAO and inflammation
  markers in non-dialysis CKD patients. TMAO, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite,
  promotes systemic inflammation through activation of pro-inflammatory pathways,
  contributing to the increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk observed
  in CKD populations with elevated TMAO.
