  node_name: COVID-19 Mortality in Pediatric Cancer Patients
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pediatric cancer diagnosis leads to initiation of immunosuppressive treatments
  including chemotherapy, radiation, and/or stem cell transplantation'
- 'Step 2: Cancer treatments and the malignancy itself compromise immune system function,
  reducing ability to mount effective antiviral responses'
- 'Step 3: Immunocompromised state increases vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection
  complications'
- 'Step 4: Despite theoretical increased risk, meta-analysis evidence shows overall
  survival of 99.4% with mortality of only 0.6% in pediatric cancer patients with
  COVID-19'

description: Meta-analysis of 15 studies with 191 pediatric cancer patients with COVID-19
  found very high survival rates (99.4%) with only 0.6% mortality. While biological
  plausibility exists for increased vulnerability due to immunosuppression from cancer
  and its treatment, empirical evidence suggests pediatric cancer patients may have
  lower COVID-19 mortality risk than initially hypothesized. Cancer type (hematological
  vs solid tumor) did not significantly affect outcomes.
