direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher infant fat mass (0-2 years) establishes early adipose tissue depots
  and metabolic programming during a critical developmental window'
- 'Step 2: Early adiposity influences adipocyte number, size, and distribution patterns
  that persist through childhood development'
- 'Step 3: Metabolic and hormonal patterns established in infancy (including leptin
  signaling and appetite regulation) track into later childhood'
- 'Step 4: These persistent biological patterns result in higher fat mass measurements
  in children and adolescents (>2 years through 16 years)'

description: This systematic review of 30 high-quality studies found that the strongest
  associations from infant body composition were between infant fat mass and later
  fat mass (7 studies) and later BMI (5 studies). All included studies used in vivo
  body composition methods other than BMI to assess infant adiposity. The positive
  tracking of adiposity from infancy to childhood/adolescence suggests early metabolic
  programming and biological persistence of body composition patterns established
  during the first two years of life.
