direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals carry specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes
  related to glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, beta-cell function, and metabolic
  regulation'
- 'Step 2: These genetic variants alter protein structure, expression levels, or regulatory
  functions of key metabolic genes (167 SNPs across 61 genes identified)'
- 'Step 3: Altered gene function leads to impaired insulin secretion, reduced insulin
  sensitivity, or dysregulated glucose homeostasis'
- 'Step 4: Chronic metabolic dysfunction results in progressive hyperglycemia and
  eventual clinical manifestation of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 67 case-control studies in the
  Indian population (33,407 cases, 30,762 controls) identified 167 SNPs across 61
  genes associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus risk. Of these, 89 SNPs mapped to
  46 genes showed statistically significant associations with T2DM risk. This genetic
  susceptibility operates through variants affecting insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity,
  and glucose metabolism pathways, establishing a direct biological mechanism linking
  inherited genetic variation to diabetes diagnosis.
