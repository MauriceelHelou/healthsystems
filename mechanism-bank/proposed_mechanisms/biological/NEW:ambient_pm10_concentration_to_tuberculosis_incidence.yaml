direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM10 particulate matter deposits in the respiratory tract,
  with particles penetrating into the lower airways and alveoli'
- 'Step 2: PM10 exposure triggers oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in pulmonary
  tissues, compromising local immune defenses'
- 'Step 3: Chronic PM10 exposure impairs alveolar macrophage function and reduces
  their ability to effectively phagocytose and kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis'
- 'Step 4: Weakened pulmonary immune surveillance increases susceptibility to new
  TB infections and may promote reactivation of latent TB infections'
- 'Step 5: Increased vulnerability to TB infection manifests as higher population-level
  incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in areas with elevated PM10 concentrations'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 8 studies demonstrates a statistically significant
  positive association between ambient PM10 air pollution and pulmonary tuberculosis
  incidence. For every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration, there is a 6% increase
  in TB incidence risk (aRR=1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.12). The biological mechanism involves
  PM10-induced impairment of pulmonary immune defenses, particularly alveolar macrophage
  dysfunction, which increases susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
  This meta-analysis included 437,255 tuberculosis cases from predominantly Asian
  populations.'
