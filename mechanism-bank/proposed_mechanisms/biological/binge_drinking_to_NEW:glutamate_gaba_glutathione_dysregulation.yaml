  node_name: Glutamate/GABA/Glutathione Dysregulation
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute binge drinking episodes cause rapid influx of alcohol into the brain,
  crossing the blood-brain barrier and reaching critical regions including the hippocampus'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol acutely inhibits NMDA glutamate receptors, blocking glutamatergic
  neurotransmission which is essential for memory formation and synaptic plasticity'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol simultaneously potentiates GABA-A receptor activity, enhancing
  inhibitory neurotransmission and further suppressing neuronal excitability'
- 'Step 4: Repeated binge drinking episodes lead to compensatory upregulation of glutamate
  receptors and downregulation of GABA receptors, creating neurochemical imbalance'
- 'Step 5: Oxidative stress from alcohol metabolism depletes glutathione, the brain''s
  primary antioxidant, particularly in vulnerable regions like the hippocampus'
- 'Step 6: The combination of glutamate/GABA dysregulation and oxidative stress (depleted
  glutathione) contributes to memory impairments including alcohol-induced blackouts'

description: Binge drinking causes dysregulation of the glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter
  systems while depleting glutathione, the brain's primary antioxidant. Alcohol acutely
  inhibits glutamatergic NMDA receptors while potentiating GABAergic transmission,
  leading to compensatory neuroadaptations with repeated exposure. Magnetic resonance
  spectroscopy (MRS) can detect these neurometabolite changes in the hippocampus,
  with alterations in glutamate, GABA, and glutathione levels preceding gross structural
  brain changes. This neurochemical dysregulation underlies alcohol-induced memory
  impairments including blackouts.
