direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower eGFR indicates more severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), reflecting
  greater loss of kidney function and filtration capacity'
- 'Step 2: More severe CKD leads to increased complications requiring medical intervention,
  including anemia, mineral bone disorders, fluid overload, and cardiovascular complications'
- 'Step 3: Patients with lower eGFR require more intensive monitoring, specialist
  consultations, laboratory testing, and medication management'
- 'Step 4: As eGFR declines below 15 mL/min/1.73m², patients often require dialysis
  preparation, vascular access procedures, or initiation of renal replacement therapy'
- 'Step 5: Increased hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient procedures,
  and kidney-specific care drive substantially higher cumulative healthcare costs'

description: Lower eGFR, indicating more severe chronic kidney disease, is associated
  with substantially higher healthcare costs. In a population-based cohort of 219,641
  adults with CKD in Alberta, Canada, mean 1-year unadjusted healthcare costs were
  Can$14,634 per patient overall, with a clear graded association between CKD severity
  and costs. Kidney-specific care costs increased from 1.6% of total costs overall
  to 32.3% (Can$14,169) for patients with eGFR<15 mL/min/1.73m². This relationship
  is driven by increased need for specialist care, hospitalizations, emergency visits,
  dialysis, and management of CKD complications.
