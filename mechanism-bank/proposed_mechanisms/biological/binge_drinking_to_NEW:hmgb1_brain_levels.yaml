direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking (achieving blood ethanol concentration of ~80 mg/dL) triggers
  acute neuroimmune signaling responses in the brain'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol exposure activates neurons, microglia, and other brain cells, causing
  them to release HMGB1 (high mobility group box protein 1) from the nucleus into
  the extracellular space'
- 'Step 3: Released HMGB1 acts as a cytokine-like signaling protein that activates
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other immune receptors on neighboring neurons and
  glia'
- 'Step 4: Repeated binge drinking episodes (particularly adolescent intermittent
  ethanol exposure) lead to persistently elevated brain HMGB1 levels and upregulation
  of HMGB1 receptors'
- 'Step 5: Elevated HMGB1 spreads pro-inflammatory signaling across neuronal and glial
  networks, contributing to lasting neuroimmune adaptations'

description: Binge drinking triggers the release of HMGB1, a cytokine-like protein,
  from activated brain cells including neurons and microglia. This review synthesizing
  approximately 100 studies demonstrates that both blood and brain levels of HMGB1
  increase with ethanol exposure. In rat models of adolescent intermittent ethanol
  binge drinking, brain HMGB1 and its receptors are persistently elevated. Human postmortem
  studies of individuals with alcohol use disorder also show elevated brain HMGB1
  levels. HMGB1 activates Toll-like receptors, spreading pro-inflammatory signaling
  that alters microglia, forebrain cholinergic neurons, and neuronal networks.
