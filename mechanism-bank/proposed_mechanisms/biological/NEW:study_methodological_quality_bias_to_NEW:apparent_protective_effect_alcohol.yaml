  node_name: Apparent Protective Effect of Alcohol on Mortality
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Studies with methodological limitations include former drinkers (who may
  have quit due to illness) and occasional drinkers in the abstainer reference group,
  creating a ''sick quitter'' bias'
- 'Step 2: These misclassified abstainer groups have elevated mortality risk due to
  pre-existing health conditions that prompted cessation of drinking'
- 'Step 3: When low-volume drinkers are compared against this artificially unhealthy
  reference group, they appear to have lower mortality risk (RR=0.84)'
- 'Step 4: Higher quality studies that exclude former and occasional drinkers from
  abstainer groups, use younger cohorts (≤55 years), and follow beyond age 55 eliminate
  these selection biases'
- 'Step 5: In higher quality studies, the apparent protective effect disappears and
  low-volume drinking shows similar mortality risk to true abstainers (RR=0.98, CI:
  0.87-1.11)'

description: Methodological quality in alcohol epidemiology studies, specifically
  related to selection bias in defining abstainer reference groups and cohort characteristics,
  significantly influences whether studies find apparent protective effects of low-volume
  alcohol consumption on mortality. Higher quality studies that avoid 'sick quitter'
  bias by excluding former and occasional drinkers from abstainer groups find no protective
  effect (RR=0.98), while lower quality studies with these biases report significant
  apparent protection (RR=0.84). This systematic review of 107 longitudinal studies
  with over 4.8 million participants demonstrates that the widely reported health
  benefits of moderate drinking may be a methodological artifact rather than a true
  biological effect.
