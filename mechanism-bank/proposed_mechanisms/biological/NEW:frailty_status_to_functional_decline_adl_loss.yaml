direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Frailty syndrome involves multi-system physiological decline including
  sarcopenia, reduced strength, diminished endurance, and impaired balance'
- 'Step 2: These physiological deficits progressively impair the ability to perform
  complex and basic physical tasks required for daily living'
- 'Step 3: Frail individuals experience accelerated functional deterioration, leading
  to loss of independence in activities of daily living (ADL) such as bathing, dressing,
  and mobility'
- 'Step 4: The vulnerability state of frailty increases susceptibility to stressors
  and complications, further compounding disability development'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 prospective studies demonstrates
  that frailty status significantly increases the risk of disability and functional
  decline. Frail individuals experience multi-system physiological deterioration that
  leads to progressive loss of ability to perform activities of daily living. The
  relationship shows a gradient effect where frail groups have significantly higher
  risks compared to prefrail and robust groups.
