direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Curcumin is ingested and absorbed, reaching hepatic tissue where it exerts
  direct antioxidant activity through its phenolic, β-diketone, and methoxy functional
  groups that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS)'
- 'Step 2: Curcumin upregulates the Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2) pathway, leading to increased expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes including
  superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione
  reductase (GR)'
- 'Step 3: Curcumin increases hepatic glutathione (GSH) levels, enhancing the liver''s
  capacity to neutralize oxidative stress and protect against lipid peroxidation'
- 'Step 4: Curcumin suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and inhibits PI3K/Akt and
  hepatic stellate cell activation, reducing inflammation-driven oxidative damage'
- 'Step 5: These combined mechanisms reduce lipid peroxidation products and overall
  hepatic oxidative stress, protecting against liver injury, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,
  fibrosis, and cirrhosis'

description: 'Curcumin intake reduces hepatic oxidative stress through multiple complementary
  mechanisms: direct free radical scavenging via its phenolic and β-diketone groups,
  upregulation of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway leading to increased expression of
  protective enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GR), enhancement of hepatic glutathione levels,
  and suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and hepatic stellate cell activation.
  This systematic review synthesizes evidence demonstrating curcumin''s protective
  effects against oxidative liver damage from various etiologies.'
