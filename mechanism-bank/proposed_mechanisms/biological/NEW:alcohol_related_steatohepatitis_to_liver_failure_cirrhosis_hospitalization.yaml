category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related steatohepatitis involves active hepatic inflammation with
  hepatocyte injury (ballooning degeneration), neutrophilic infiltration, and fat
  accumulation in the liver'
- 'Step 2: Persistent inflammation triggers hepatic stellate cell activation, leading
  to progressive fibrosis through excessive collagen deposition and extracellular
  matrix remodeling'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis leads to cirrhosis at an annualized rate of approximately
  10% (6-17%) in patients with steatohepatitis, significantly higher than other ALD
  stages'
- 'Step 4: Cirrhosis results in portal hypertension, synthetic dysfunction, and decompensation
  events requiring hospitalization for liver failure'

description: Alcohol-related steatohepatitis requiring hospitalization represents
  the most dangerous subtype of alcohol-related liver disease. This systematic review
  of 37 studies (7,528 participants) found that steatohepatitis has the highest annualized
  progression rate to cirrhosis (10%, range 6-17%) compared to steatosis (3%) or fibrosis
  alone (8%). Inpatient steatohepatitis cohorts demonstrate particularly poor outcomes
  with 15% annual mortality, confirming that hospitalization-requiring steatohepatitis
  strongly predicts progression to cirrhosis and liver failure.
