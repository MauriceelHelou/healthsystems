direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM2.5 particles leads to pulmonary and systemic inflammation
  through oxidative stress and activation of inflammatory pathways'
- 'Step 2: Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis
  progression, and autonomic nervous system imbalance'
- 'Step 3: These cardiovascular stressors increase myocardial workload, impair cardiac
  function, and exacerbate existing cardiac conditions'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative cardiovascular damage results in increased heart failure incidence,
  hospitalizations, and mortality, with both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term)
  exposure contributing to risk'

description: This meta-analysis of 100 studies from 20 countries demonstrates that
  both short-term and long-term PM2.5 exposure significantly increases the risk of
  heart failure outcomes including incidence, hospitalization, and mortality. Short-term
  exposure showed a 1.8% increased risk per 10 μg/m³ increment in PM2.5, while long-term
  exposure demonstrated a substantially larger 74.8% increased risk per 10 μg/m³ increment.
  The biological mechanisms involve PM2.5-induced systemic inflammation, oxidative
  stress, endothelial dysfunction, and autonomic imbalance that collectively impair
  cardiac function and promote heart failure development and progression.
