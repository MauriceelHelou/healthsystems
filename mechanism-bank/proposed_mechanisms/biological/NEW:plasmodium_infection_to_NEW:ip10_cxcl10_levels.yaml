mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Plasmodium parasites infect red blood cells and trigger innate immune recognition
  through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs)'
- 'Step 2: Activated immune cells, particularly monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic
  cells, produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in response to parasitemia'
- 'Step 3: IFN-γ stimulates specific leukocytes including neutrophils, eosinophils,
  and monocytes to produce and secrete IP-10/CXCL10'
- 'Step 4: Elevated circulating IP-10/CXCL10 levels serve as a chemokine attracting
  CXCR3-positive immune cells to sites of infection and inflammation'
- 'Step 5: IP-10/CXCL10 levels correlate with disease severity, with particularly
  elevated levels observed in cerebral malaria cases'

description: Plasmodium infection triggers a robust immune response that leads to
  elevated circulating IP-10/CXCL10 levels. This chemokine is produced by activated
  leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes) in response to interferon-gamma
  signaling during malaria infection. A systematic review of 26 studies consistently
  demonstrated elevated IP-10 levels in malaria patients compared to healthy controls,
  with levels generally correlating with disease severity.
