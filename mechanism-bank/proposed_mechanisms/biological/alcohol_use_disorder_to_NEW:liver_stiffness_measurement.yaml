direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in alcohol use disorder leads to direct hepatotoxic
  effects on liver cells through acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species generation'
- 'Step 2: Persistent hepatocyte injury triggers inflammatory responses and activation
  of hepatic stellate cells'
- 'Step 3: Activated stellate cells produce excessive extracellular matrix proteins,
  particularly collagen, leading to progressive liver fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Accumulation of fibrous tissue and architectural changes in liver parenchyma
  increase tissue stiffness'
- 'Step 5: Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) via elastography techniques detects increased
  tissue stiffness, with values above 20-25 kPa indicating advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis
  and increased risk of decompensation'

description: Alcohol use disorder causes progressive liver damage through direct hepatotoxic
  effects, inflammation, and stellate cell activation, leading to fibrosis and increased
  liver stiffness. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) using elastography techniques
  provides a non-invasive, dynamic biomarker of this pathophysiological process, with
  values above 20-25 kPa indicating advanced disease and increased risk of hepatic
  decompensation and mortality.
