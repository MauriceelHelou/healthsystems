direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic risk variants (110 independent loci identified) influence gene
  expression in brain tissues through regulatory mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Prioritized genes affect neurobiological pathways involved in reward processing,
  stress response, and executive function through chromatin interactions and altered
  expression patterns'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes increase vulnerability to problematic drinking
  patterns and reduce capacity to moderate alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic risk, captured by polygenic risk scores, predicts elevated
  susceptibility to developing alcohol use disorder across diverse ancestral populations'

description: Large-scale multi-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis identified 110 independent
  genetic risk variants associated with problematic alcohol use (PAU), a composite
  phenotype combining alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related problems. Fine-mapping
  and gene prioritization through brain tissue expression and chromatin interaction
  analyses revealed neurobiological mechanisms underlying genetic risk. Polygenic
  risk scores derived from these variants predict alcohol use disorder susceptibility,
  with cross-ancestry scores outperforming single-ancestry scores, demonstrating the
  clinical potential of genetic insights for risk stratification.
