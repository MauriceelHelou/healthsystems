direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Progressive histological damage to the liver graft develops, including
  steatosis (fatty infiltration), steatohepatitis (inflammation), and advancing fibrosis'
- 'Step 2: Ongoing hepatic injury leads to architectural distortion, decreased hepatocyte
  function, and eventual progression to graft cirrhosis in severe cases'
- 'Step 3: Recurrent cirrhosis causes portal hypertension, synthetic dysfunction,
  and hepatic decompensation, contributing to graft failure'
- 'Step 4: Graft failure and hepatic decompensation increase long-term mortality,
  with recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis responsible for approximately 20% of deaths on
  follow-up after liver transplantation'

description: Liver graft histological damage including steatosis, steatohepatitis,
  and progression to fibrosis/cirrhosis significantly increases long-term mortality
  in liver transplant recipients. A meta-analysis of 7 studies found that patients
  with graft damage (relapsers vs abstainers as proxy) were over 3.6 times more likely
  to die at 10-year follow-up. The progression from steatosis (OR 4.1) through steatohepatitis
  (OR 4.5) to advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis (OR 8.4) represents a spectrum of increasing
  graft injury. Recurrent cirrhosis, occurring in 9% of biopsied patients, was responsible
  for approximately 20% of all deaths during follow-up.
