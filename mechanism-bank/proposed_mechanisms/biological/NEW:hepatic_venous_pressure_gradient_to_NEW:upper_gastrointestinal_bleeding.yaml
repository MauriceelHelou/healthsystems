mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) reflects increased portal
  venous pressure in patients with liver cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Portal hypertension leads to the development of portosystemic collaterals,
  including gastroesophageal varices'
- 'Step 3: Higher HVPG increases pressure within these varices, causing progressive
  dilation and wall tension'
- 'Step 4: When HVPG exceeds critical thresholds (typically >12 mmHg), variceal wall
  tension exceeds structural integrity, leading to rupture'
- 'Step 5: Variceal rupture results in upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can
  be life-threatening in cirrhotic patients'

description: Elevated hepatic venous pressure gradient is a direct hemodynamic driver
  of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. The HVPG reflects portal
  pressure, which when elevated leads to the formation and progressive dilation of
  gastroesophageal varices. This systematic review of 10 randomized trials (810 participants)
  confirmed that interventions reducing HVPG are used specifically to prevent variceal
  bleeding, demonstrating the established causal relationship between portal pressure
  and bleeding risk. The review noted carvedilol was more effective at reducing HVPG,
  though clinical bleeding outcomes showed uncertainty due to low quality evidence.
