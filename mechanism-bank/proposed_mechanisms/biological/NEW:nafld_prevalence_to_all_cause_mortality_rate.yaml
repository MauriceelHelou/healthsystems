- 'Step 1: NAFLD involves hepatic steatosis and progressive liver inflammation, leading
  to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in a subset of patients'
- 'Step 2: Progressive liver damage leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased risk
  of hepatocellular carcinoma (1.8 cases per 1000 person-years)'
- 'Step 3: NAFLD is associated with systemic metabolic dysfunction including insulin
  resistance, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation'
- 'Step 4: These metabolic derangements increase cardiovascular disease risk, which
  is a leading cause of death in NAFLD patients'
- 'Step 5: Combined hepatic and cardiovascular complications result in elevated overall
  mortality rate (5.3 deaths per 1000 person-years)'

description: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with increased
  all-cause mortality through multiple pathways including progressive liver disease
  leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as systemic metabolic
  dysfunction contributing to cardiovascular mortality. This meta-analysis of 237
  studies across Asia found an overall mortality rate of 5.3 deaths per 1000 person-years
  among NAFLD patients, with hepatocellular carcinoma incidence of 1.8 cases per 1000
  person-years.
