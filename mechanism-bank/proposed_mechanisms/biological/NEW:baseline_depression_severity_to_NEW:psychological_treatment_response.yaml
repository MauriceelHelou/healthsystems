direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher baseline depression severity indicates more entrenched neurobiological
  dysregulation, including alterations in stress response systems, neurotransmitter
  function, and neural circuit connectivity'
- 'Step 2: Severe depression is associated with greater cognitive impairments (concentration,
  memory, executive function) that interfere with engagement in psychological treatment
  processes requiring active participation and learning'
- 'Step 3: More severe depressive symptoms create greater behavioral inhibition, anhedonia,
  and reduced motivation, limiting patient capacity to complete therapeutic homework
  and implement behavioral changes'
- 'Step 4: Chronic or severe depression may involve more treatment-resistant biological
  substrates that are less responsive to psychological intervention alone, resulting
  in poorer treatment outcomes'

description: Baseline depression severity is the only replicated and consistent predictor
  of poorer treatment response in psychological interventions for persisting forms
  of depression. This systematic review of 23 studies found that among 65 predictor
  and moderator variables examined (including sociodemographic, clinical, interpersonal/personality,
  and psychological factors), only baseline severity showed consistent negative association
  with treatment outcomes across multiple studies.
