mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic risk variants (110 independent loci identified) influence gene
  expression and chromatin interactions in brain tissues'
- 'Step 2: These variants affect neural pathways involved in reward processing, impulse
  control, and stress response through prioritized genes in brain tissue'
- 'Step 3: Altered neurobiological function increases vulnerability to problematic
  alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Shared genetic architecture between problematic alcohol use and other substance
  use traits (highest genetic correlations observed) creates cross-substance vulnerability'
- 'Step 5: Genetic predisposition manifests as increased risk for substance use disorder
  through common biological pathways affecting addiction-related brain circuits'

description: Genetic risk variants for problematic alcohol use (PAU) show strong genetic
  correlations with other substance use traits, representing the highest observed
  correlations among all traits examined. The 110 identified risk variants influence
  gene expression in brain tissues through chromatin interactions, affecting neural
  pathways that underlie addiction vulnerability. This shared genetic architecture
  indicates common biological mechanisms between PAU and broader substance use disorders,
  with cross-ancestry analyses confirming the robustness of these genetic associations
  across diverse populations.
