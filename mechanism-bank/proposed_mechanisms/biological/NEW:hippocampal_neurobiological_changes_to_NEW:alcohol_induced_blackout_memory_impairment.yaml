direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking causes acute alcohol exposure that disrupts hippocampal
  neurotransmitter systems, particularly glutamate and GABA signaling'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol potentiates GABA-A receptor activity and inhibits NMDA glutamate
  receptors in the hippocampus, disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP) essential
  for memory consolidation'
- 'Step 3: Repeated binge drinking episodes lead to oxidative stress in the hippocampus,
  indexed by depleted glutathione levels'
- 'Step 4: These neurochemical disruptions impair the transfer of information from
  short-term to long-term memory storage in the hippocampus'
- 'Step 5: The resulting memory formation blockade manifests as partial (fragmentary)
  or complete (en bloc) blackouts during intoxication'

description: Hippocampal neurobiological changes, including disrupted glutamate/GABA
  neurotransmission and oxidative stress (depleted glutathione), directly impair the
  hippocampus's ability to consolidate memories. These changes block the transfer
  of information to long-term storage, resulting in alcohol-induced blackouts. The
  adolescent hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to these alcohol-induced disruptions
  due to ongoing developmental processes.
