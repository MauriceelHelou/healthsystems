mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes progressive liver damage, leading to
  alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) characterized by steatosis, steatohepatitis,
  and fibrosis'
- 'Step 2: Persistent hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress from alcohol metabolism
  promote hepatocyte injury, regeneration cycles, and accumulation of DNA damage'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis advances to cirrhosis, creating a pre-malignant microenvironment
  with chronic inflammation, impaired immune surveillance, and altered hepatocyte
  turnover'
- 'Step 4: The cirrhotic liver environment facilitates malignant transformation of
  hepatocytes, leading to development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)'

description: Alcohol-related liver disease represents a major risk factor for hepatocellular
  carcinoma development. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the epidemiological
  relationship between ALD prevalence and alcohol-attributable HCC cases across Asian
  populations over two decades. The biological pathway involves chronic alcohol-induced
  hepatic injury leading to inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately malignant
  transformation of hepatocytes.
