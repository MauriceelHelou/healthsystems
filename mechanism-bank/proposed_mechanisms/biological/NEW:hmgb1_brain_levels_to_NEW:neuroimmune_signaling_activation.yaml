direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HMGB1 (high mobility group box protein 1) is released from activated brain
  cells including neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in response to cellular stress,
  injury, or alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 2: Released HMGB1 acts as a cytokine-like signaling protein that can function
  alone or form heteromers with other molecules (e.g., cytokines, nucleic acids)'
- 'Step 3: HMGB1 and its heteromers bind to and activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
  particularly TLR4 and TLR2, on neurons and glial cells'
- 'Step 4: TLR activation triggers intracellular pro-inflammatory signaling cascades
  that shift gene transcription toward inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 5: This signaling spreads across neurons and glia, activating microglia and
  altering synaptic function through complement proteins'
- 'Step 6: The resulting neuroimmune activation contributes to neuronal network alterations,
  affecting mood, cognition, and behavior'

description: HMGB1 released from brain cells activates Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  to trigger neuroimmune signaling cascades. This cytokine-like protein, alone or
  in heteromers with other molecules, binds TLRs on neurons and glia, initiating pro-inflammatory
  signaling that spreads throughout the brain. This mechanism has been validated in
  both rodent models (adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure) and human postmortem
  studies showing elevated HMGB1 and TLRs in alcohol use disorder brains. The signaling
  activates microglia, alters cholinergic neurons, and modifies neuronal networks
  through complement-mediated synaptic changes.

- name: Age at exposure

  description: Adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure persistently increases brain
    HMGB1 and TLR levels more than adult exposure, with lasting effects on neuroimmune
    signaling
- name: Alcohol exposure pattern
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Binge drinking patterns (achieving blood ethanol concentration of 80
    mg/dL) particularly promote HMGB1-TLR signaling activation compared to lower-level
    consumption
- name: Chronicity of exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Both blood and brain levels of HMGB1 increase progressively with repeated
    ethanol exposure, amplifying neuroimmune signaling over time
