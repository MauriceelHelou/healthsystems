direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to intimate partner violence subjects victims to repeated traumatic
  experiences including physical assault, threat of harm, and psychological abuse'
- 'Step 2: Traumatic stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
  and sympathetic nervous system, triggering fear conditioning and stress hormone
  dysregulation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure leads to alterations in brain structures involved in fear
  processing (amygdala hyperactivation) and memory consolidation (hippocampal changes)'
- 'Step 4: These neurobiological changes manifest as post-traumatic stress symptoms
  including intrusive re-experiencing, hyperarousal, avoidance behaviors, and negative
  alterations in cognition and mood'

description: This meta-analysis of 51 studies from Sub-Saharan Africa found a medium
  effect size for the association between intimate partner violence victimization
  and post-traumatic stress symptoms. IPV exposure leads to PTSD symptomatology through
  repeated traumatic stress exposure, HPA axis dysregulation, and neurobiological
  changes in fear and memory processing systems. The finding highlights the need to
  incorporate IPV interventions into mental health treatment approaches.
