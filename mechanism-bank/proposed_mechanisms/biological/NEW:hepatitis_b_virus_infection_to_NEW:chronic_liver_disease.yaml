mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects hepatocytes and establishes chronic infection
  in a proportion of infected individuals'
- 'Step 2: Persistent viral replication triggers ongoing hepatic inflammation and
  immune-mediated liver cell damage'
- 'Step 3: Repeated cycles of necroinflammation lead to progressive hepatic fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Advanced fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis and established chronic liver
  disease'

description: Hepatitis B virus infection is the leading etiological cause of chronic
  liver disease in Ethiopia, accounting for 40% of all CLD cases. The virus causes
  persistent hepatic inflammation and progressive liver damage leading to fibrosis,
  cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease. Hospital mortality among CLD patients is
  approximately 25%.
