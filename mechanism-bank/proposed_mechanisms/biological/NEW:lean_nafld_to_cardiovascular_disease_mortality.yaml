direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lean individuals develop NAFLD despite normal BMI, often due to metabolic
  dysfunction including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and visceral adiposity disproportionate
  to total body fat'
- 'Step 2: NAFLD promotes systemic metabolic derangements including atherogenic dyslipidemia
  (elevated triglycerides, low HDL, small dense LDL), chronic low-grade inflammation,
  and impaired glucose metabolism'
- 'Step 3: Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis contribute to increased production
  of proatherogenic and prothrombotic factors, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: These metabolic and inflammatory disturbances accelerate atherosclerosis
  and cardiovascular disease progression'
- 'Step 5: Lean individuals with NAFLD experience increased cardiovascular mortality
  relative to lean individuals without NAFLD, potentially due to underrecognition
  and undertreatment of metabolic comorbidities'

description: Lean NAFLD is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality compared
  to lean individuals without NAFLD. This clinical practice update synthesizes multiple
  studies showing that despite normal BMI, lean individuals with NAFLD harbor significant
  metabolic dysfunction including insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and
  systemic inflammation that promote atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The
  expert review emphasizes that multiple studies confirm elevated cardiovascular mortality
  in this population, warranting routine evaluation for comorbid metabolic conditions.
