mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lichen sclerosus causes chronic inflammation of affected skin tissue, primarily
  in genital regions (77% females, 99% males)'
- 'Step 2: Persistent inflammatory microenvironment leads to ongoing tissue damage,
  cellular turnover, and DNA damage accumulation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling create conditions favorable
  for malignant transformation, increasing skin neoplasm risk as a documented complication'

description: This systematic review of 900 studies identified skin neoplasms as a
  documented complication of lichen sclerosus. The chronic inflammatory nature of
  LS, characterized by pigmentary changes, architectural alterations, atrophy, and
  ongoing tissue damage, creates a pro-oncogenic microenvironment that increases the
  risk of malignant transformation in affected tissues.
