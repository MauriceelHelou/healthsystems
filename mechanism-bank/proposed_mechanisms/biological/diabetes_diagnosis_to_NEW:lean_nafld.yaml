direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Type 2 diabetes mellitus creates a state of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia
  that affects hepatic lipid metabolism even in individuals without obesity'
- 'Step 2: Insulin resistance promotes de novo lipogenesis in the liver while simultaneously
  impairing fatty acid oxidation, leading to intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation'
- 'Step 3: The metabolic dysfunction associated with T2DM (dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia)
  drives hepatic steatosis development independent of overall body mass index'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated hepatic fat triggers inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress,
  potentially progressing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and fibrosis in lean individuals'

description: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease in lean individuals (BMI <25 kg/m2 for non-Asians, <23 kg/m2
  for Asians). The AGA Clinical Practice Update recommends screening for NAFLD in
  T2DM patients over 40 years and emphasizes that T2DM should prompt consideration
  of NAFLD even in lean individuals. An estimated 7-20% of NAFLD cases occur in lean
  individuals, and T2DM is a key metabolic comorbidity driving this condition. Lean
  individuals with NAFLD face increased cardiovascular, liver, and all-cause mortality.
