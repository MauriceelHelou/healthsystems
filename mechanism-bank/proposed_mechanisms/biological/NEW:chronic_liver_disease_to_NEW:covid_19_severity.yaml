direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic liver disease impairs hepatic function, reducing the liver''s ability
  to synthesize proteins essential for immune response and coagulation'
- 'Step 2: Compromised liver function leads to dysregulated systemic inflammation
  and reduced clearance of inflammatory mediators during SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 3: Pre-existing hepatic inflammation and fibrosis create a pro-inflammatory
  state that amplifies COVID-19-induced cytokine storm'
- 'Step 4: Impaired hepatic metabolism affects drug processing and reduces effectiveness
  of COVID-19 treatments'
- 'Step 5: Combined hepatic and systemic dysfunction leads to multi-organ failure
  and increased severity of COVID-19 outcomes'

description: Chronic liver disease significantly increases the risk of severe COVID-19
  outcomes. This meta-analysis of 40 studies with over 900,000 participants found
  that patients with pre-existing CLD had 2.44 times higher odds of developing severe
  COVID-19 compared to those without CLD. The mortality risk was similarly elevated
  (OR = 2.35). The mechanism involves impaired hepatic function compromising immune
  response, amplifying inflammatory cascades, and contributing to multi-organ dysfunction
  during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
