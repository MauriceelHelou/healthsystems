direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Females have lower levels of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activity,
  resulting in reduced first-pass metabolism of alcohol in the stomach'
- 'Step 2: Higher blood alcohol concentrations are achieved in females compared to
  males for equivalent alcohol intake due to lower total body water content and different
  body composition'
- 'Step 3: Estrogen enhances gut permeability and endotoxin absorption, increasing
  hepatic exposure to inflammatory mediators'
- 'Step 4: Female livers demonstrate increased oxidative stress and inflammatory responses
  to alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 5: These biological factors result in accelerated hepatocyte damage, fibrosis
  progression, and cirrhosis development at lower cumulative alcohol doses in females
  compared to males'

description: Females demonstrate significantly higher susceptibility to alcohol-related
  liver cirrhosis compared to males at equivalent levels of alcohol consumption. This
  meta-analysis of 24 studies including over 3 million participants found that at
  40g alcohol per day, females had a relative risk of 9.35 compared to 2.82 for males,
  representing a more than 3-fold higher relative risk. This sex difference is attributed
  to biological factors including differences in alcohol metabolism, body composition,
  hormonal influences on hepatic inflammation, and enhanced oxidative stress responses
  in female livers.
