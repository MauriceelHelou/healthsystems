direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dietary nutrients (choline, carnitine, betaine from red meat, eggs, fish)
  are metabolized by gut microbiota to produce trimethylamine (TMA)'
- 'Step 2: TMA is absorbed and transported to the liver where flavin monooxygenases
  (FMO3) oxidize it to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)'
- 'Step 3: Elevated circulating TMAO promotes atherosclerosis through enhanced macrophage
  foam cell formation and cholesterol accumulation in arterial walls'
- 'Step 4: TMAO contributes to endothelial dysfunction, platelet hyperreactivity,
  and thrombosis risk'
- 'Step 5: These cumulative vascular effects increase the risk of cardiovascular events
  leading to cardiovascular disease mortality'

description: Circulating TMAO, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite from dietary nutrients,
  is positively associated with cardiovascular disease mortality. This umbrella review
  and meta-analysis synthesizing 82 individual studies found highly suggestive evidence
  for the TMAO-CVD mortality association. TMAO promotes atherosclerosis, endothelial
  dysfunction, and thrombosis through multiple mechanisms, contributing to increased
  cardiovascular mortality risk.
