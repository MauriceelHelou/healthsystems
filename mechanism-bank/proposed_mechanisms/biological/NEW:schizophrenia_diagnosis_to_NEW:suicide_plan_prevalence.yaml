direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Schizophrenia involves neurobiological abnormalities affecting dopaminergic,
  glutamatergic, and serotonergic systems that impair emotional regulation, reality
  testing, and cognitive function'
- 'Step 2: These neurobiological disturbances contribute to persistent psychotic symptoms,
  depression, hopelessness, and command hallucinations that may direct self-harm'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive impairments and executive dysfunction associated with schizophrenia
  may reduce problem-solving capacity and increase vulnerability to suicidal thinking
  progressing to concrete planning'
- 'Step 4: The chronic nature of schizophrenia and awareness of illness impact leads
  to demoralization and increased likelihood of formulating suicide plans, with lifetime
  prevalence reaching 44.3% and point prevalence ranging 6.4-13%'

description: Individuals with schizophrenia have substantially elevated prevalence
  of suicide plans compared to the general population, with lifetime prevalence of
  44.3% and point prevalence ranging from 6.4% to 13%. This meta-analysis of 26 studies
  covering 5079 people with schizophrenia demonstrates that the neurobiological and
  psychological burden of schizophrenia creates significant vulnerability to suicidal
  planning, particularly among males and inpatients.
