direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The rs3782886 variant in BRAP is located near the ALDH2 gene locus on chromosome
  12, and is in linkage disequilibrium with functional ALDH2 variants'
- 'Step 2: ALDH2 encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, a key enzyme in alcohol metabolism
  that converts toxic acetaldehyde to acetate'
- 'Step 3: Variants in this region are associated with reduced ALDH2 enzymatic activity,
  leading to acetaldehyde accumulation after alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Acetaldehyde accumulation causes aversive symptoms (facial flushing, nausea,
  tachycardia) that discourage continued alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: This protective aversive response reduces the likelihood of developing
  alcohol use disorder'

description: The rs3782886 variant in BRAP, located near the ALDH2 gene locus, was
  identified as a lead variant associated with reduced alcohol use disorder risk in
  the largest GWAS of AUD in East Asians. This variant tags functional variation in
  the ALDH2 gene region that affects alcohol metabolism. Reduced ALDH2 activity leads
  to acetaldehyde accumulation and aversive physiological responses to alcohol, providing
  a protective effect against AUD development.
