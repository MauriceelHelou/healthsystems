direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Food insecurity leads to constrained food budgets, forcing reliance on
  cheaper, energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods high in refined carbohydrates and unhealthy
  fats'
- 'Step 2: Irregular eating patterns and cyclical food availability during food-insecure
  periods may dysregulate lipid metabolism'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from food insecurity activates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  axis, potentially affecting lipid profiles through cortisol-mediated pathways'
- 'Step 4: Limited healthcare access among food-insecure populations may delay diagnosis
  and management of dyslipidemia, though quantitative laboratory evidence for the
  association remains inconclusive'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the relationship between
  food insecurity and dyslipidemia across cross-sectional studies. While theoretical
  mechanisms suggest food insecurity could lead to dyslipidemia through poor diet
  quality and metabolic stress, the quantitative evidence from laboratory assessments
  did not demonstrate significantly elevated odds of abnormal lipid measurements among
  food-insecure individuals. However, food-insecure patients were more likely to self-report
  prior dyslipidemia diagnoses, suggesting potential measurement or healthcare access
  differences.
