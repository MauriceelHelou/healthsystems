category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dietary fiber is consumed and passes largely undigested through the upper
  gastrointestinal tract to reach the colon'
- 'Step 2: Colonic gut microbiota ferment the dietary fiber through anaerobic metabolic
  processes'
- 'Step 3: Microbial fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), primarily
  acetate, propionate, and butyrate'

description: Dietary fiber serves as a substrate for microbial fermentation in the
  gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiota metabolize fiber through anaerobic fermentation
  processes, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) including acetate, propionate,
  and butyrate as metabolic byproducts. This relationship is well-established as a
  foundational mechanism linking fiber intake to various metabolic health outcomes.
