direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol misuse leads to direct toxic effects on skeletal muscle
  tissue through ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts the balance between anabolic (muscle-building) and catabolic
  (muscle-breakdown) pathways, favoring protein degradation'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol impairs muscle regeneration capacity by affecting satellite cell
  function and myogenic processes'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure causes increased inflammation and fibrosis within muscle
  tissue'
- 'Step 5: Mitochondrial dysfunction and deficiencies in energetic balance reduce
  muscle ATP production and oxidative capacity'
- 'Step 6: These combined effects result in progressive skeletal muscle weakness and
  atrophy characteristic of alcoholic myopathy'

description: Chronic alcohol misuse causes alcoholic myopathy through multiple interconnected
  biological mechanisms including disruption of anabolic-catabolic balance, impaired
  muscle regeneration, increased inflammation and fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
  These pathological processes collectively lead to progressive skeletal muscle weakness
  and atrophy.
