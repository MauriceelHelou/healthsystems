mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Frailty syndrome develops, characterized by decreased physiological reserve
  across multiple organ systems including musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiovascular
  systems'
- 'Step 2: Muscle weakness (sarcopenia), impaired balance, reduced gait speed, and
  decreased reaction time develop as core components of the frailty phenotype'
- 'Step 3: These physiological deficits compromise postural stability and the ability
  to recover from perturbations during movement'
- 'Step 4: Diminished capacity to maintain balance and respond to environmental challenges
  significantly increases fall risk'
- 'Step 5: When falls occur, frail individuals have reduced protective responses and
  greater vulnerability to injury due to decreased bone density and muscle mass'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 prospective studies establishes
  that frailty significantly increases the risk of falls among middle-aged and older
  adults. The frailty syndrome, characterized by diminished physiological reserves
  across multiple body systems, leads to muscle weakness, impaired balance, reduced
  mobility, and slowed reaction times that collectively predispose individuals to
  falls and subsequent injuries. The relationship shows a gradient effect, with frail
  individuals at substantially higher risk than prefrail or robust counterparts.
