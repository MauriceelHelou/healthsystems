category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NAFLD-related HCC can develop through non-cirrhotic pathways, where hepatocarcinogenesis
  occurs via direct lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation in steatotic
  liver tissue without requiring progression to cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic dysfunction in NAFLD (insulin resistance, lipid accumulation,
  adipokine dysregulation) creates a pro-oncogenic environment that promotes hepatocyte
  transformation independent of the fibrosis-cirrhosis-cancer sequence typical of
  viral hepatitis or alcohol-related liver disease'
- 'Step 3: As a result, patients with NAFLD-related HCC have significantly lower prevalence
  of underlying cirrhosis (50.4%) compared to patients with HCC from other etiologies
  (64.0%), demonstrating NAFLD''s unique carcinogenic pathway'

description: Meta-analysis of 17 studies (11,477 patients) demonstrates that NAFLD-related
  HCC is associated with significantly lower cirrhosis prevalence (50.4% vs 64.0%,
  P<0.001) compared to HCC of other etiologies. This reflects NAFLD's unique pathophysiology
  where hepatocellular carcinoma can develop through metabolic and lipotoxic pathways
  without requiring progression through cirrhosis, unlike viral or alcohol-related
  liver disease.

  description: NAFLD-related HCC patients were older, suggesting longer exposure to
    metabolic risk factors may compensate for lack of cirrhosis in cancer development
