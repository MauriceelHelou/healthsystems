direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM2.5 particles allows ultrafine particles and their chemical
  components to enter the respiratory system and translocate into systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 particles and associated toxic compounds (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
  heavy metals) reach the liver through portal and systemic circulation'
- 'Step 3: Hepatic exposure to PM2.5 components induces oxidative stress, chronic
  inflammation, and DNA damage in liver cells'
- 'Step 4: Persistent oxidative stress and inflammatory responses promote hepatocyte
  injury, cellular proliferation, and genomic instability'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated DNA damage and dysregulated cellular processes increase risk
  of hepatocellular carcinogenesis and liver cancer development'

description: PM2.5 exposure is associated with increased liver cancer incidence through
  systemic translocation of inhaled particles and their toxic constituents to the
  liver, where they induce oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and DNA damage
  leading to hepatocarcinogenesis. A meta-analysis of cohort studies found a 31% increased
  risk of liver cancer per unit increase in PM2.5 exposure, with all included studies
  showing positive associations.
