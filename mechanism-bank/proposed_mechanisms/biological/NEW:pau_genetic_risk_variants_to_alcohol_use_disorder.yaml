direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals inherit risk variants at 29 independent genetic loci associated
  with problematic alcohol use, including genes involved in neurotransmission, alcohol
  metabolism, and brain function'
- 'Step 2: These genetic variants alter gene expression and protein function in brain
  regions, with genetic heritability enriched in brain tissue and conserved/regulatory
  genomic regions'
- 'Step 3: Altered neurobiological function affects reward processing, impulse control,
  and alcohol metabolism, increasing vulnerability to problematic drinking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Genetic predisposition interacts with substance use behaviors, psychiatric
  conditions, and risk-taking tendencies (supported by Mendelian randomization evidence)
  to promote development of alcohol use disorder'

description: Large-scale genome-wide meta-analysis identified 29 independent risk
  variants for problematic alcohol use, with genetic heritability enriched in brain
  tissue and regulatory genomic regions. The study combined data from Million Veteran
  Program, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, and UK Biobank, finding 19 novel loci.
  Genetic correlations with 138 phenotypes and phenome-wide polygenic risk score analysis
  confirmed relationships between PAU genetic risk and substance use/psychiatric disorders.
  Mendelian randomization provided evidence for causal pathways involving substance
  use, psychiatric status, risk-taking, and cognitive performance.
