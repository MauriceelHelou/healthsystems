direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vitamin D supplementation increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in
  COVID-19 patients'
- 'Step 2: Adequate vitamin D levels enhance innate immune function through cathelicidin
  and defensin production, which have antimicrobial properties'
- 'Step 3: Vitamin D modulates adaptive immune responses and reduces excessive inflammatory
  cytokine production (cytokine storm)'
- 'Step 4: Reduced inflammation and improved immune regulation decrease risk of severe
  COVID-19 progression'
- 'Step 5: Lower disease severity reduces need for ICU admission and decreases mortality
  risk'

description: 'Meta-analysis of 5 RCTs demonstrates that vitamin D supplementation
  reduces COVID-19 mortality risk (OR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34-0.72) and ICU admission (OR
  0.28, 95% CI: 0.20-0.39). Vitamin D plays a crucial role in immune function and
  inflammation regulation. Trial sequential analysis confirmed definitive evidence
  for ICU admission protection, while mortality findings require further studies for
  confirmation.'
