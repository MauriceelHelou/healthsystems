direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term exposure to NO2, a marker of combustion-related air pollution
  (traffic, industrial sources), leads to chronic inhalation of this reactive gas'
- 'Step 2: NO2 causes oxidative stress and inflammation in the respiratory system,
  with effects extending to systemic inflammation and cardiovascular damage'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular
  disease (particularly ischemic heart disease) and respiratory conditions'
- 'Step 4: These pathological processes increase the risk of premature mortality from
  multiple causes, including cardiovascular and respiratory deaths'

description: Long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker of combustion
  sources including traffic, is significantly associated with increased all-cause
  mortality. Meta-analysis of epidemiological cohort studies found a pooled estimate
  of 5% excess risk per 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2 exposure. NO2 exposure contributes
  to mortality primarily through cardiovascular disease pathways, particularly ischemic
  heart disease.
