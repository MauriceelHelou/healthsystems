direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: In cirrhosis, impaired liver function reduces capacity to convert ammonia
  to urea via the urea cycle, leading to elevated blood ammonia concentrations'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters astrocytes
  in the central nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Within astrocytes, ammonia is metabolized to glutamine, causing osmotic
  stress and astrocyte swelling'
- 'Step 4: Astrocyte dysfunction leads to altered neurotransmission, cerebral edema,
  and neuroinflammation'
- 'Step 5: These neurotoxic effects manifest clinically as hepatic encephalopathy,
  ranging from subtle cognitive impairment (minimal HE) to overt neuropsychiatric
  symptoms'

description: Ammonia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy
  in cirrhosis. Elevated blood ammonia concentrations result from impaired hepatic
  ammonia clearance and contribute to the neurotoxic effects underlying both minimal
  and overt hepatic encephalopathy. This Cochrane systematic review of 11 RCTs (943
  participants) evaluated ammonia-targeting pharmacotherapies and confirmed that these
  drugs reduce blood ammonia concentrations compared to placebo, supporting the causal
  link between elevated ammonia and hepatic encephalopathy, though clinical outcome
  effects remain uncertain.
