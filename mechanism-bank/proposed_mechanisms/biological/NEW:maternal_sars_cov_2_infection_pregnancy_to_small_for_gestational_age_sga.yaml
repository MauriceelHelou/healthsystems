direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers systemic inflammatory response with
  elevated cytokines and inflammatory markers during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Placental inflammation and potential vascular dysfunction occur, including
  possible ACE2 receptor-mediated effects on placental tissue'
- 'Step 3: Compromised uteroplacental blood flow and nutrient transfer capacity reduce
  fetal nutrient and oxygen delivery'
- 'Step 4: Fetal growth restriction develops, resulting in birth weight below the
  10th percentile for gestational age (SGA status)'

description: This systematic review of 204 studies including 45,646 infants across
  36 countries found that small for gestational age status was more common in infants
  born following maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, particularly in larger
  studies. The biological pathway likely involves maternal immune activation, placental
  inflammation, and subsequent impairment of fetal growth.
