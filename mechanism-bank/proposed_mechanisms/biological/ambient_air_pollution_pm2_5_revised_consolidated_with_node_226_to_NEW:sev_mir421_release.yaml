direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PM2.5 particles are inhaled and deposited in the respiratory tract, causing
  pulmonary injury to bronchial epithelial cells'
- 'Step 2: Damaged lung cells (bronchial epithelial cells) respond to PM2.5 exposure
  by increasing production and release of small extracellular vesicles (sEV)'
- 'Step 3: PM2.5 exposure specifically increases CD63/CD81/CD9 positive sEV particles,
  as demonstrated by single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensing analysis'
- 'Step 4: These respiratory system-derived sEV are enriched with miR-421 cargo'
- 'Step 5: sEV-enclosed miR-421 is released into systemic circulation, enabling cross-talk
  between pulmonary and cardiovascular systems'

description: PM2.5 exposure causes pulmonary injury that triggers bronchial epithelial
  cells to release small extracellular vesicles (sEV) containing miR-421 into circulation.
  This represents a key mechanism by which air pollution-induced lung injury can cause
  systemic effects, particularly cardiovascular dysfunction. The sEV particles positive
  for CD63/CD81/CD9 surface markers are increased following PM2.5 exposure, carrying
  miR-421 cargo that mediates organ cross-talk.
