- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes direct hepatotoxic injury to liver cells,
  leading to a spectrum of alcohol-related liver diseases (ARLD) including fatty liver,
  alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 2: Progressive liver damage leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis (comprising 32.9%
  of ARLD spectrum), with associated complications including ascites (25.1% prevalence
  in ARLD population)'
- 'Step 3: Advanced liver disease results in liver failure, portal hypertension, and
  hepatocellular carcinoma, leading to liver-related mortality (21.6% liver-specific
  mortality rate among ARLD patients)'
- 'Step 4: Overall mortality among ARLD patients reaches 23.9%, reflecting both direct
  liver-related deaths and systemic complications of chronic liver disease'

description: 'Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) directly leads to liver disease
  mortality through progressive hepatic injury. This systematic review of 372 studies
  found that ARLD has a global prevalence of 4.8%, with alcoholic liver cirrhosis
  comprising the highest proportion (32.9%) of the disease spectrum. The mortality
  burden is substantial: overall mortality among ARLD patients is 23.9%, with liver-specific
  mortality at 21.6%. Disease progression is driven by chronic alcohol exposure, with
  patients typically having >20 years of heavy drinking (average 146.6 g/day). Complications
  such as ascites affect 25.1% of patients, reflecting advanced liver decompensation.'
