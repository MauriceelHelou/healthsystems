direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic ethanol intake promotes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) diffusion from
  the gut into systemic circulation, triggering neuroinflammatory cascades'
- 'Step 2: Oxygen radicals generated from catechol/salsolinol oxidation contribute
  to oxidative stress in brain tissue'
- 'Step 3: Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation potentiate each other, creating
  a self-reinforcing cycle that perpetuates alcohol-seeking behavior'
- 'Step 4: This neurobiological state maintains chronic alcohol intake independent
  of the initial acetaldehyde-mediated reinforcement mechanisms'
- 'Step 5: Interventions targeting oxidative stress (N-acetyl cysteine, 60-70% reduction)
  and neuroinflammation (mesenchymal stem cells) effectively reduce maintenance of
  chronic intake and relapse'

description: Chronic ethanol consumption induces a self-perpetuating cycle of oxidative
  stress and neuroinflammation that maintains alcohol intake independently of initial
  reinforcement mechanisms. This process involves gut-derived LPS translocation and
  reactive oxygen species from salsolinol oxidation. The oxidative stress-neuroinflammation
  axis potentiates itself, creating neurobiological conditions that sustain chronic
  drinking behavior. Crucially, while acetaldehyde/salsolinol drive acquisition of
  alcohol intake, maintenance depends on these oxidative-inflammatory mechanisms,
  as demonstrated by the marked effectiveness of antioxidant (NAC) and anti-inflammatory
  (MSC) interventions in reducing chronic intake.
