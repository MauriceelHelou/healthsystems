mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-invasive tests (FIB4, ELF, FibroScan, FibroTest) measure biomarkers
  and physical properties of liver tissue that reflect underlying hepatic fibrosis
  severity'
- 'Step 2: Higher scores on these tests indicate more advanced liver fibrosis, which
  represents progressive replacement of functional hepatocytes with scar tissue'
- 'Step 3: Advanced fibrosis leads to impaired liver function, portal hypertension,
  and increased risk of hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis culminates in cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease,
  significantly elevating mortality risk from liver-related causes'

description: Non-invasive fibrosis tests predict liver disease mortality by measuring
  the degree of hepatic fibrosis, which is the strongest prognostic factor for mortality
  in chronic liver disease. Higher test scores indicate more advanced fibrosis and
  correspondingly higher mortality risk. In alcohol-related liver disease, all four
  major NITs (FIB4, ELF, FibroScan, FibroTest) demonstrated acceptable prognostic
  performance with AUROCs generally exceeding 0.7.
