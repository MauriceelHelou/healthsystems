direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes chronic infection in hepatocytes, leading
  to persistent viral replication and immune-mediated liver injury'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation triggers hepatic stellate cell activation and progressive
  fibrogenesis with collagen deposition'
- 'Step 3: Sustained fibrosis over years to decades leads to architectural distortion,
  nodule formation, and eventual cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: Cirrhosis manifests with portal hypertension and hepatic dysfunction, leading
  to complications including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma'

description: Hepatitis C virus infection is a major etiological factor for cirrhosis,
  accounting for approximately 41% of cirrhosis cases in the US. Chronic HCV infection
  causes progressive liver fibrosis through persistent inflammation and immune-mediated
  hepatocyte injury, ultimately leading to cirrhosis over 20-30 years in untreated
  individuals. The relationship is well-established with significant overlap between
  hepatitis C and other cirrhosis risk factors.
