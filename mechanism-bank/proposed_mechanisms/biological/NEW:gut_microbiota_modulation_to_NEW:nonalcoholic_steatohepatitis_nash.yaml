description: Modulation of gut microbiota composition, particularly reduction of harmful
  inflammatory bacteria, decreases systemic inflammation through the gut-liver axis.
  This reduces hepatic inflammatory burden and oxidative stress, thereby attenuating
  the progression and severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The intestinal
  microbiota plays an important role in NASH pathogenesis, and therapeutic strategies
  targeting gut dysbiosis may provide beneficial effects on hepatic health.
