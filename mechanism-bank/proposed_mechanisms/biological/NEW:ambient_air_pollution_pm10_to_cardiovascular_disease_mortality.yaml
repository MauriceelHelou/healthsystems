  node_id: cardiovascular_disease_mortality
  node_name: Cardiovascular Disease Mortality
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM10 particulate matter deposits in the respiratory tract,
  with smaller particles reaching deep lung tissue'
- 'Step 2: Particles trigger local and systemic inflammatory responses, oxidative
  stress, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial dysfunction, increased blood
  viscosity, and enhanced coagulation'
- 'Step 4: These cardiovascular stressors increase risk of acute cardiac events including
  myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and heart failure exacerbation'
- 'Step 5: Acute cardiovascular events lead to increased cardiovascular mortality,
  particularly in vulnerable populations'

description: Meta-analysis of 30 studies demonstrates that acute exposure to PM10
  is significantly associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in China. Each
  10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration is associated with a 0.39% excess risk of
  cardiovascular mortality. The association is strongest at lag 0-1 days, suggesting
  acute pathophysiological effects. Vulnerable subpopulations include females, elderly
  (≥65 years), and those exposed during cooler temperatures.
