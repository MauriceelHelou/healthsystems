category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Postpartum infections (puerperal sepsis, endometritis, wound infections)
  develop following childbirth, with bacterial colonization and proliferation in the
  reproductive tract or surgical sites'
- 'Step 2: Infection progresses during days 8-42 postpartum as pathogens multiply,
  with delayed presentation due to incubation periods and gradual symptom development'
- 'Step 3: Untreated or inadequately treated infections lead to systemic inflammatory
  response, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Severe sepsis results in maternal death, with 61.3% of infection-related
  postpartum deaths occurring in the 8-42 day window'

description: Systematic review of 32 studies found that 61.3% of maternal deaths due
  to infection occur between days 8-42 postpartum, representing the predominant timing
  for infection-related mortality. This delayed mortality pattern reflects the natural
  history of puerperal infections, which require time to develop from initial colonization
  to systemic sepsis. Unlike hemorrhage (79.1% on day 1) or eclampsia (predominantly
  first week), infections manifest later, making the extended postpartum period particularly
  critical for infection surveillance and treatment.
