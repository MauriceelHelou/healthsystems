direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dietary intake of choline, L-carnitine, and betaine from foods like red
  meat, eggs, and fish provides substrates for gut microbiota metabolism'
- 'Step 2: Gut microbiota convert these dietary nutrients to trimethylamine (TMA),
  which is absorbed into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 3: TMA is oxidized to trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver by flavin-containing
  monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)'
- 'Step 4: Elevated circulating TMAO promotes insulin resistance through inflammatory
  pathways and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 5: TMAO may impair glucose tolerance and beta-cell function, contributing
  to development of diabetes mellitus'

description: Circulating TMAO, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite produced from dietary
  choline and carnitine, is positively associated with diabetes mellitus risk. This
  umbrella review and meta-analysis found highly suggestive evidence supporting this
  association. TMAO may contribute to diabetes through mechanisms involving insulin
  resistance, inflammation, and impaired glucose metabolism.
