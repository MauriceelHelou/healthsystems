category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systemic inflammation (e.g., from liver cirrhosis or chronic alcohol-induced
  immune activation) generates elevated circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  immune mediators'
- 'Step 2: These peripheral inflammatory signals cross the blood-brain barrier through
  multiple mechanisms including cytokine transport, vagal nerve signaling, and compromised
  barrier integrity'
- 'Step 3: Peripheral immune signals activate microglia (brain immune cells), triggering
  central inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 4: Activated microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines within the brain,
  establishing neuroinflammatory state'
- 'Step 5: Chronic systemic inflammation attenuates initial compensatory microglial
  neuroprotective responses, leading to sustained neuroinflammation'

description: Systemic inflammation, particularly from alcohol-related liver damage
  and chronic immune activation, propagates to the central nervous system through
  circulating pro-inflammatory mediators that activate brain microglia. This somatic
  immune system activation negatively impacts brain functioning. While acute exposure
  may trigger compensatory neuroprotective microglial responses, chronic systemic
  inflammation attenuates these protective mechanisms and promotes sustained neuroinflammatory
  states.
