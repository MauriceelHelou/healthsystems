direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dietary nutrients (choline, L-carnitine, betaine) from foods like red meat,
  eggs, and fish are metabolized by gut microbiota to produce trimethylamine (TMA)'
- 'Step 2: TMA is absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to the liver where
  it is oxidized by flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) to form trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO)'
- 'Step 3: Elevated circulating TMAO promotes atherosclerosis through enhanced macrophage
  foam cell formation and altered cholesterol metabolism'
- 'Step 4: TMAO contributes to endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and
  platelet hyperreactivity, increasing cardiovascular disease risk'
- 'Step 5: TMAO also impairs renal function and promotes hypertension, further compounding
  cardiometabolic risk'
- 'Step 6: These cumulative effects on cardiovascular health, kidney function, and
  metabolic processes increase the risk of all-cause mortality'

description: Circulating trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite
  from dietary nutrients, is positively associated with all-cause mortality. This
  umbrella review and meta-analysis of 82 individual studies found highly suggestive
  evidence for this association. TMAO promotes cardiovascular disease through multiple
  mechanisms including atherosclerosis promotion, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet
  hyperreactivity, while also contributing to hypertension, diabetes, and impaired
  kidney function, collectively increasing mortality risk.
