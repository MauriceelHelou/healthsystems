direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Albuminuria indicates glomerular damage and increased permeability of the
  kidney filtration barrier, reflecting underlying kidney pathology'
- 'Step 2: Higher albuminuria severity is associated with accelerated CKD progression,
  increased cardiovascular complications, and higher rates of acute kidney injury
  events'
- 'Step 3: These complications necessitate more frequent healthcare utilization including
  hospitalizations, emergency department visits, specialist consultations, and pharmaceutical
  interventions'
- 'Step 4: Patients with severe albuminuria require more intensive monitoring, disease
  management, and treatment of comorbid conditions, driving up direct medical costs'

description: In a population-based cohort study of 219,641 adults with CKD in Alberta,
  Canada, healthcare costs demonstrated a graded positive association with albuminuria
  severity. Patients with more severe albuminuria had higher 1-year cumulative healthcare
  costs, which included drugs, physician visits, emergency department visits, outpatient
  procedures, dialysis, and hospitalizations. The mean unadjusted cumulative 1-year
  cost was Can$14,634 per patient overall, with costs increasing substantially for
  those with more severe albuminuria independent of eGFR category. This relationship
  reflects the biological pathway whereby albuminuria indicates greater kidney damage
  and predicts accelerated disease progression and complications requiring more intensive
  and costly healthcare interventions.
