direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Plasmodium infection triggers immune response, stimulating leukocytes (neutrophils,
  eosinophils, monocytes) to produce and secrete IP-10/CXCL10 chemokine'
- 'Step 2: IP-10/CXCL10 acts as a chemoattractant, recruiting immune cells including
  T lymphocytes and monocytes to sites of infection, including the cerebral vasculature'
- 'Step 3: Elevated IP-10 levels contribute to excessive inflammatory responses at
  the blood-brain barrier, promoting endothelial activation and dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: The resulting neuroinflammation and vascular pathology leads to cerebral
  malaria manifestations including coma and neurological complications'

description: This systematic review of 26 studies demonstrates that IP-10/CXCL10 levels
  are elevated in patients with Plasmodium infections compared to healthy controls,
  with several studies specifically indicating elevated IP-10 levels in cerebral malaria
  cases. IP-10 is produced by specific leukocytes and plays key roles in immune response
  to malaria. The chemokine appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of severe disease
  through inflammatory mechanisms, though some heterogeneity exists in findings across
  studies.
