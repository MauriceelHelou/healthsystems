direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Administration of cannabinoid products (particularly those with comparable
  THC-to-CBD ratios of ~1:1 or synthetic high THC-to-CBD ratio products) for chronic
  pain management'
- 'Step 2: THC binds to CB1 receptors in the central nervous system, particularly
  in brain regions controlling motor function, coordination, and alertness'
- 'Step 3: CB1 receptor activation modulates neurotransmitter release, affecting GABAergic
  and glutamatergic signaling pathways that regulate consciousness and vestibular
  function'
- 'Step 4: Central nervous system depression manifests as sedation, while vestibular
  and cerebellar effects produce dizziness as common adverse effects'

description: Systematic review evidence indicates that cannabinoid use for chronic
  pain, particularly products with comparable THC-to-CBD ratios (~1:1) and synthetic
  high THC products, is associated with increased risk for sedation and dizziness
  as adverse effects. These are among the most common harms reported and should be
  discussed with patients, with advice to avoid driving or dangerous activities while
  using THC-containing products.
