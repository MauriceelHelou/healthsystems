  node_name: Major Depression
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic stressors (e.g., heavy alcohol consumption) provoke an immune response
  in the periphery, increasing circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines'
- 'Step 2: Circulatory cytokines and neuroimmune mediators cross the blood-brain barrier
  or signal through afferent pathways (immune-to-brain communication)'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation activates microglia (resident CNS immune cells),
  amplifying neuroinflammation'
- 'Step 4: Neuroinflammatory mediators alter neurotransmitter metabolism, synaptic
  plasticity, and neuroendocrine function'
- 'Step 5: These neurobiological alterations manifest as depressive symptoms and contribute
  to the development and progression of major depression'

description: Systemic and CNS inflammation contributes to major depression through
  bidirectional immune-brain communication. Peripheral immune activation generates
  circulating cytokines that signal to the brain via afferent pathways. This activates
  microglia and promotes neuroinflammation, which disrupts neurotransmitter systems
  and brain function, ultimately manifesting as depressive illness. This mechanism
  is particularly relevant in conditions like alcohol use disorder where chronic inflammation
  is prominent.
