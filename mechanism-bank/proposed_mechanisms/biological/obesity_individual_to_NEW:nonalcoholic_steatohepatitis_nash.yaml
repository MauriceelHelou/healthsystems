mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Obesity leads to excessive accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes,
  causing hepatic steatosis (fatty liver)'
- 'Step 2: Chronic lipid overload triggers lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction in liver cells'
- 'Step 3: These processes activate inflammatory pathways, leading to hepatocyte injury,
  inflammation, and the progression from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
  (NASH)'
- 'Step 4: Sustained inflammation and cell death promote a cycle of hepatocyte regeneration
  and fibrosis development'

description: Obesity is a primary driver of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the
  most common chronic liver disease in developed countries. The mechanism involves
  hepatic lipid accumulation leading to steatosis, followed by lipotoxicity-induced
  inflammation, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte injury that characterizes the transition
  to NASH. This paper, referencing a meta-analysis of 19 studies, confirms the strong
  link between obesity and NASH development, while also noting that obesity can contribute
  to liver pathology independent of traditional fibrosis pathways.
