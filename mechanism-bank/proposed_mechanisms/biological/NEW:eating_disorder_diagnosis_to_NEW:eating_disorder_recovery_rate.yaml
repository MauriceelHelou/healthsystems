direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Formal eating disorder diagnosis (AN, BN, BED, OSFED) enables identification
  of specific pathophysiological patterns and symptom clusters requiring targeted
  intervention'
- 'Step 2: Diagnosis initiates access to evidence-based treatments including family-based
  therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, dialectical behavioral
  therapy, nutritional interventions, and pharmacological treatments specific to ED
  subtype'
- 'Step 3: Treatment engagement over time leads to normalization of eating behaviors,
  weight restoration (in AN), reduction in binge-purge cycles, and improvement in
  psychological functioning'
- 'Step 4: Recovery rates increase progressively with duration of follow-up: 42% at
  <2 years, 54% at 4-6 years, 64% at 8-10 years, and 67% at ≥10 years, indicating
  time-dependent biological and psychological healing processes'

description: Eating disorder diagnosis across subtypes (AN, BN, BED, OSFED) is positively
  associated with recovery, with overall recovery occurring in 46% of patients at
  mean follow-up of 44.9 months. Recovery rates improve substantially over time, reaching
  67% at ≥10 years. The diagnosis enables access to subtype-specific evidence-based
  treatments that address the underlying biological and psychological mechanisms of
  disordered eating.
