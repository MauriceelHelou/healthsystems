direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves neurodevelopmental alterations
  affecting neural circuitry, particularly in regions governing attention, executive
  function, and impulse control'
- 'Step 2: Shared genetic and neurobiological substrates between ASD and ADHD create
  vulnerability for co-occurring attention deficits and hyperactivity symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Children and adolescents with ASD demonstrate significantly elevated rates
  of ADHD comorbidity (26.2% prevalence), indicating strong biological association
  between these neurodevelopmental conditions'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 39 population-based studies found that 26.2% (95%
  CI: 22-31%) of children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder have comorbid
  Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. This represents the second highest psychiatric
  comorbidity in ASD after intellectual disability, demonstrating substantial biological
  overlap between these neurodevelopmental conditions. Population-based estimates
  are lower than clinical samples but still indicate considerable co-occurrence without
  referral bias.'
