direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fatty liver syndrome (encompassing NAFLD and AFLD) initiates with hepatic
  steatosis - accumulation of fat in liver cells'
- 'Step 2: Continued hepatic fat accumulation triggers inflammatory responses and
  oxidative stress, leading to steatohepatitis'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation activates hepatic stellate cells, promoting fibrogenesis
  and progressive hepatic fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis advances through stages (F0-F4), culminating in cirrhosis
  with architectural distortion of the liver'
- 'Step 5: Cirrhosis leads to liver-related complications including portal hypertension,
  hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure'
- 'Step 6: These end-stage liver complications result in increased liver disease mortality'

description: Fatty liver syndrome represents a spectrum of liver pathology that progresses
  from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis and fibrosis to cirrhosis and liver-related
  mortality. The disease's advancement to cirrhosis and liver-related complications
  necessitates assessment of disease severity. The progression from fatty liver to
  fibrosis to cirrhosis represents the key pathway through which this condition leads
  to liver disease mortality.
