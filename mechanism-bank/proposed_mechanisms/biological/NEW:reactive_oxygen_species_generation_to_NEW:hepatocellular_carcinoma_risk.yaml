  node_id: NEW:hepatocellular_carcinoma_risk
  node_name: Hepatocellular Carcinoma Risk
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol and tobacco use promotes excessive generation of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) within hepatic cells'
- 'Step 2: ROS expose hepatocyte DNA to continuous oxidative stress, leading to DNA
  damage including strand breaks and base modifications'
- 'Step 3: DNA damage activates protective repair machinery (ATM, ATR, H2AX, MRN complex),
  but excessive ROS overwhelms repair capacity'
- 'Step 4: Excessive ROS generation results in genetic predisposition through polymorphisms
  in xenobiotic metabolic pathway genes (ADH, ALDH, CYP2E1, GSTT1, GSTP1, GSTM1)'
- 'Step 5: ROS activate or repress epigenetic elements including chromatin remodeling,
  microRNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications affecting gene expression'
- 'Step 6: ROS-induced inflammatory processes become inherently associated with hepatocellular
  carcinogenesis'
- 'Step 7: Cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations drive progression through
  liver fibrosis and cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma'

description: Reactive oxygen species generation within hepatocytes causes continuous
  oxidative stress and DNA damage. This oxidative damage, combined with genetic polymorphisms
  in metabolic pathway genes and epigenetic alterations, promotes inflammatory processes
  and progressive liver disease, ultimately increasing hepatocellular carcinoma risk
  through fibrosis and cirrhosis pathways.
