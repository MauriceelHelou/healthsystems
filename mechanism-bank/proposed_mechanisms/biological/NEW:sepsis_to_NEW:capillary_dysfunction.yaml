- 'Step 1: Sepsis induces systemic inflammatory response with release of inflammatory
  mediators and endothelial dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory mediators impair capillary endothelial function and alter
  microvascular blood flow regulation'
- 'Step 3: Sepsis decreases erythrocyte oxygen-dependent ATP efflux, reducing the
  ability of red blood cells to signal for vasodilation in hypoxic tissues'
- 'Step 4: The combination of endothelial dysfunction and impaired erythrocyte signaling
  results in inadequate capillary response within hypoxic capillaries'
- 'Step 5: Impaired capillary response leads to tissue hypoxia and contributes to
  organ dysfunction in sepsis'

description: Sepsis impairs the capillary response within hypoxic capillaries through
  multiple mechanisms including decreased erythrocyte oxygen-dependent ATP efflux.
  Under normal conditions, erythrocytes release ATP in response to low oxygen tension,
  which triggers vasodilation to increase blood flow to hypoxic tissues. In sepsis,
  this signaling mechanism is disrupted, compromising the microcirculation's ability
  to respond appropriately to tissue hypoxia and contributing to organ dysfunction.
