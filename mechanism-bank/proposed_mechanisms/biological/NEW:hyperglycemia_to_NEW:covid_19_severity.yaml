direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hyperglycemia impairs immune function, including reduced neutrophil chemotaxis,
  phagocytosis, and bactericidal activity, compromising the body''s initial defense
  against SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood glucose creates a pro-inflammatory state and enhances viral
  replication, leading to increased viral load and more extensive tissue damage'
- 'Step 3: Hyperglycemia promotes endothelial dysfunction and a hypercoagulable state,
  increasing risk of microvascular complications and thrombotic events'
- 'Step 4: The combination of impaired immunity, enhanced inflammation, and vascular
  dysfunction leads to progression to severe/critical COVID-19, including acute respiratory
  distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac injury'
- 'Step 5: These complications increase the need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation,
  and ultimately mortality in COVID-19 patients'

description: This meta-analysis of 8 observational studies (2,729 patients) demonstrates
  that hyperglycemia is significantly associated with increased COVID-19 severity.
  Among hyperglycemic patients, 72% developed severe/critical COVID-19, 17% died,
  11% required ICU admission, 23% required ventilation, 15% developed ARDS, 14% had
  acute cardiac injury, and 5% had acute kidney injury. Hyperglycemic patients had
  higher risk of all adverse outcomes compared to normoglycemic patients, regardless
  of diabetes status.
