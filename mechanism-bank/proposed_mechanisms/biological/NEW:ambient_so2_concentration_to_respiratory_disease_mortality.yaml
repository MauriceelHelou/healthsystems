direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of ambient SO2 leads to direct irritation of respiratory tract
  mucosa and airways'
- 'Step 2: SO2 exposure triggers inflammatory responses in the respiratory system,
  causing oxidative stress and epithelial damage'
- 'Step 3: Chronic or repeated exposure exacerbates existing respiratory conditions
  including chronic lower respiratory diseases, influenza, and pneumonia'
- 'Step 4: Inflammatory burden and respiratory impairment contribute to increased
  risk of respiratory mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations'

description: 'Short-term exposure to ambient SO2 is associated with increased respiratory
  mortality. A 10 μg/m3 increase in two-day moving average SO2 concentration was associated
  with RR 1.402 (95% CI: 0.827-2.854) for respiratory mortality. The effect remained
  statistically significant after adjusting for co-pollutants in multi-pollutant models.
  The majority of respiratory deaths (62.9%) were attributed to chronic lower respiratory
  diseases, followed by influenza and pneumonia (28.5%).'
