mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13/PCV15) induce serotype-specific
  immune responses by presenting capsular polysaccharide antigens conjugated to carrier
  proteins'
- 'Step 2: Vaccination triggers production of serotype-specific IgG antibodies and
  memory B cells against targeted pneumococcal serotypes (12-15 serotypes depending
  on vaccine)'
- 'Step 3: Higher antibody titers and immunogenicity correlate with enhanced opsonophagocytic
  killing activity against pneumococcal bacteria'
- 'Step 4: Robust immune response provides protection against invasive pneumococcal
  disease, pneumonia, and otitis media caused by vaccine-covered serotypes'
- 'Step 5: Population-level vaccination reduces pneumococcal carriage, providing indirect
  herd protection and further decreasing vaccine-preventable disease incidence'

description: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines induce serotype-specific immune responses
  that provide protection against invasive pneumococcal disease. This systematic review
  and meta-analysis of 20 RCTs demonstrated that PCV15 was non-inferior to PCV13 for
  shared serotypes in both infants (12 serotypes) and adults (13 serotypes), with
  superior immune responses for the additional serotypes 22F and 33F unique to PCV15.
  The robust antibody response generated by vaccination directly reduces susceptibility
  to pneumococcal infections, thereby decreasing vaccine-preventable disease incidence.
