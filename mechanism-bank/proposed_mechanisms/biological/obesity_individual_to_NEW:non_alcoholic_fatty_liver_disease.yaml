direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Obesity results from chronic caloric excess and physical inactivity, leading
  to positive energy balance and increased adipose tissue accumulation'
- 'Step 2: Excess adiposity promotes metabolic dysfunction including insulin resistance,
  altered lipid metabolism, and chronic low-grade inflammation'
- 'Step 3: These metabolic disturbances lead to increased hepatic free fatty acid
  influx and de novo lipogenesis in the liver'
- 'Step 4: Excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes (hepatic steatosis) develops,
  defining NAFLD'
- 'Step 5: The relationship between obesity and NAFLD is further exacerbated by associated
  conditions including metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes'

description: Obesity is a primary risk factor for NAFLD through multiple interconnected
  biological mechanisms. The meta-analysis confirms that overweight/obesity, along
  with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, represents a major pathway to NAFLD
  development. Chronic caloric excess and physical inactivity drive adiposity, which
  in turn promotes hepatic fat accumulation through insulin resistance, altered lipid
  metabolism, and inflammatory processes. The evidence demonstrates a dose-response
  relationship where higher levels of obesogenic dietary patterns (ultra-processed
  foods) significantly increase NAFLD risk.
