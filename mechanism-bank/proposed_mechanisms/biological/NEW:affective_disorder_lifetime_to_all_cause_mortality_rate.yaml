category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with lifetime affective disorders in substance use treatment
  populations may have greater treatment engagement and help-seeking behavior due
  to their psychiatric symptomatology'
- 'Step 2: Affective disorder diagnosis may serve as a marker for individuals who
  are more likely to receive comprehensive mental health and medical care, including
  regular monitoring'
- 'Step 3: Treatment for affective disorders (antidepressants, mood stabilizers, psychotherapy)
  may provide protective effects against impulsive behaviors and high-risk substance
  use patterns'
- 'Step 4: The reduced mortality risk (HR 0.58) suggests that affective disorder presence
  may indicate a population subgroup with different risk profiles or better treatment
  responsiveness compared to those without affective disorders'

description: 'In a 19-year prospective cohort study of 291 patients with substance
  use disorders, having a lifetime affective disorder at baseline was associated with
  a significantly lower risk of death (HR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.91). This counterintuitive
  finding suggests that in this high-risk population, affective disorder diagnosis
  may serve as a marker for treatment engagement, healthcare access, or represent
  a subgroup with different behavioral risk profiles compared to those without affective
  disorders.'
