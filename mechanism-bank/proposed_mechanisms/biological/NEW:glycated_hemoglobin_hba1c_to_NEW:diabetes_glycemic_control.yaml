direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HbA1c reflects average blood glucose levels over the preceding 2-3 months
  through glycation of hemoglobin molecules'
- 'Step 2: Higher HbA1c levels indicate prolonged exposure to elevated blood glucose,
  reflecting poor glycemic control'
- 'Step 3: Dietary interventions (e.g., carbohydrate counting) that reduce HbA1c demonstrate
  improved glycemic control, confirming the inverse relationship'
- 'Step 4: Sustained reductions in HbA1c indicate improved long-term glucose regulation
  and better diabetes management outcomes'

description: 'HbA1c serves as a biomarker of long-term glycemic control, with higher
  levels indicating poorer glucose management. This systematic review of 11 RCTs with
  899 T1DM patients demonstrated that interventions reducing HbA1c (mean follow-up
  52 weeks) directly improve glycemic control. The negative relationship indicates
  that as HbA1c decreases, glycemic control improves, with a standardized mean difference
  of -0.52% (95% CI: -0.82 to -0.23) when comparing carbohydrate counting to standard
  education.'
