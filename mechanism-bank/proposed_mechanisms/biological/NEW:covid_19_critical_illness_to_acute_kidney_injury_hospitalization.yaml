direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which
  are highly expressed in kidney proximal tubular cells, enabling viral entry and
  direct renal injury'
- 'Step 2: Critical illness in COVID-19 ICU patients triggers systemic inflammatory
  responses, cytokine storms, and hemodynamic instability leading to renal hypoperfusion'
- 'Step 3: Shock and vasopressor use in critically ill patients further compromises
  renal blood flow and tubular function'
- 'Step 4: Combined direct viral injury, systemic inflammation, and hemodynamic compromise
  result in acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization and potentially renal replacement
  therapy'

description: Critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU have a 51% pooled
  rate of developing acute kidney injury. The mechanism involves direct viral injury
  through ACE2 receptor binding in kidney tissue, systemic inflammatory responses,
  and hemodynamic instability including shock requiring vasopressors. Approximately
  20% of critically ill COVID-19 patients require renal replacement therapy.

  description: COVID-19 and other ACE2-associated viruses showed lower RRT rates (20%)
    compared to non-ACE2-associated viruses (49%), possibly due to lower frequencies
    of shock in ACE2-associated infections
