mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mental disorders among patients with substance use disorders create neurobiological
  dysregulation affecting physical health systems including sleep, appetite, energy
  levels, and pain perception'
- 'Step 2: Comorbid mental health conditions lead to reduced motivation for physical
  self-care, decreased engagement in health-promoting behaviors, and poor medication
  adherence for physical health conditions'
- 'Step 3: The biological burden of mental disorders (chronic stress, HPA axis dysregulation,
  inflammation) compounds with substance use effects to accelerate physical health
  decline'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative physical health deterioration manifests as reduced functional
  capacity, increased somatic symptoms, and diminished physical quality of life'

description: Mental disorders among patients with substance use disorders are significantly
  associated with reduced physical quality of life. A meta-analysis of 4 studies (n=3515)
  found that having mental disorders was associated with lower physical QoL (β = -1.05,
  p = 0.001). The mechanism involves both direct biological effects of mental illness
  on physical health systems and indirect effects through reduced self-care and health
  behaviors.
