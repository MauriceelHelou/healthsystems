direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low maternal hemoglobin concentration (<110 g/L) reduces oxygen-carrying
  capacity of maternal blood, leading to tissue hypoxia'
- 'Step 2: Chronic hypoxia triggers oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in
  the placenta and uterine environment'
- 'Step 3: Placental dysfunction and inflammatory mediators activate premature uterine
  contractions and cervical ripening'
- 'Step 4: These physiological changes precipitate preterm labor and delivery before
  37 weeks gestation'

description: Low maternal hemoglobin concentration (<110 g/L) during pregnancy is
  significantly associated with increased risk of preterm birth. This meta-analysis
  of 148 studies found that maternal anemia at any time point in pregnancy increases
  odds of preterm birth by 35%. The association is stronger when assessed earlier
  in pregnancy and with more severe anemia.
