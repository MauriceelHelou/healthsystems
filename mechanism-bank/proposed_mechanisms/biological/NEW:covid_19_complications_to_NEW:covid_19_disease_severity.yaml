category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 infection triggers inflammatory responses and direct viral damage
  to multiple organ systems, leading to complications including ARDS, respiratory
  failure, and liver injury'
- 'Step 2: ARDS and respiratory failure impair gas exchange and oxygen delivery, causing
  systemic hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Liver injury reflects systemic inflammation and potential direct viral
  hepatotoxicity, contributing to metabolic dysregulation and reduced drug metabolism
  capacity'
- 'Step 4: These complications create a cascade of physiological deterioration requiring
  intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and advanced supportive measures'
- 'Step 5: The accumulation of organ damage and systemic dysfunction significantly
  increases the risk of ICU admission, disease progression, and mortality'

description: COVID-19 complications including ARDS, respiratory failure, and liver
  injury are strongly and positively associated with increased disease severity and
  mortality. In this meta-analysis of 187 studies with 77,013 patients, respiratory
  failure demonstrated the strongest association with severe/critical disease (OR
  105.12), while ARDS was present in 94.17% of critical cases. Liver injury prevalence
  increased from 10% in mild cases to 43.48% in severe cases, indicating a dose-response
  relationship between complications and disease severity.
