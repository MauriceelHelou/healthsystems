mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption initiates hepatic steatosis (fatty liver),
  with annual mortality rate of 6% (4-7%) and liver-specific mortality of 1% per year'
- 'Step 2: Progressive disease advances through steatohepatitis, characterized by
  inflammation and hepatocyte damage, with annualized progression to cirrhosis of
  10% (6-17%)'
- 'Step 3: Steatohepatitis requiring hospitalization represents the most dangerous
  subtype with 15% annual mortality (8-26% in inpatients)'
- 'Step 4: Development of cirrhosis marks end-stage liver disease with annualized
  mortality of 8% (5-13%), predominantly from liver-specific causes'
- 'Step 5: Cirrhosis leads to liver failure, portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma,
  and other complications directly causing death'

description: Alcohol-related liver disease follows a progressive histological pathway
  from steatosis through steatohepatitis and fibrosis to cirrhosis, with each stage
  associated with increasing risk of liver-specific mortality. This systematic review
  of 37 studies with 7,528 participants demonstrates that even early-stage steatosis
  carries significant mortality risk (6%/year), while advanced stages show markedly
  higher death rates. Steatohepatitis requiring hospitalization represents the most
  lethal subtype at 15% annual mortality. The progression rates confirm that alcohol-related
  steatosis is not benign and that liver disease mortality increases as histological
  damage advances.
