  node_id: NEW:sars_cov_2_infection_risk
  node_name: SARS-CoV-2 Infection Risk
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vitamin D deficiency (low 25(OH)D concentrations) impairs innate immune
  function, reducing antimicrobial peptide production (cathelicidins and defensins)
  that normally provide first-line defense against respiratory pathogens'
- 'Step 2: Deficient vitamin D status compromises epithelial barrier integrity in
  respiratory mucosa, potentially facilitating viral entry and colonization'
- 'Step 3: Reduced vitamin D availability impairs adaptive immune responses and may
  dysregulate inflammatory pathways, decreasing the host''s ability to mount effective
  antiviral defenses against SARS-CoV-2'
- 'Step 4: The combination of weakened innate immunity and impaired barrier function
  results in increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 studies found that vitamin
  D deficiency is significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Both adjusted (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.24-2.53) and unadjusted analyses (OR: 1.75; 95%
  CI: 1.44-2.13) demonstrated consistent positive associations between vitamin D deficiency
  and infection risk. The biological plausibility is supported by vitamin D''s known
  immunomodulatory functions, including regulation of antimicrobial peptides and immune
  cell function.'
