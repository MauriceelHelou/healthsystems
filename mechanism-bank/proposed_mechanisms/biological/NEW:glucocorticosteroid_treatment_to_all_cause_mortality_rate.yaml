mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Glucocorticosteroids are administered to patients with alcoholic hepatitis
  to reduce inflammation through suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune
  cell activity'
- 'Step 2: The anti-inflammatory effect is hypothesized to reduce hepatic necroinflammation
  and prevent progression of liver damage'
- 'Step 3: Reduced liver inflammation and damage would theoretically decrease complications
  and mortality risk'
- 'Step 4: However, meta-analysis of 16 randomized clinical trials shows NO statistically
  significant effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.15), indicating
  the biological mechanism does not translate to meaningful clinical mortality reduction'

description: This Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 randomized clinical
  trials (1861 participants) found no evidence that glucocorticosteroids reduce all-cause
  mortality in people with alcoholic hepatitis compared to placebo or no intervention.
  The proposed biological mechanism involves anti-inflammatory effects reducing hepatic
  necroinflammation, but this did not translate to mortality benefits. The effect
  estimate was RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.70-1.15) with moderate heterogeneity (I²=45%). All
  trials were at high risk of bias and the certainty of evidence was rated very low.
  Wide confidence intervals mean clinically significant benefits or harms cannot be
  ruled out.

  description: Studies included both mild (Maddrey's score <32) and severe (≥32) alcoholic
    hepatitis, but subgroup analyses were limited by inadequate individual participant
    data reporting
- name: Alcohol abstinence
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Risk of death depends on severity of liver damage and abstinence from
    alcohol; resolution of hepatitis possible with abstinence regardless of treatment
