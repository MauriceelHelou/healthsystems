direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes macro- and microstructural damage to white
  matter tracts, particularly in the corpus callosum (genu and body), cingulum (anterior
  and posterior), and fornix'
- 'Step 2: Damage to the corpus callosum disrupts interhemispheric communication essential
  for coordinated cognitive processing, including executive functions and motor coordination'
- 'Step 3: Cingulum alterations impair connectivity between frontal and temporal regions
  critical for attention, memory encoding, and emotional regulation'
- 'Step 4: Fornix degradation compromises hippocampal connectivity, leading to deficits
  in episodic memory and spatial navigation'
- 'Step 5: The cumulative disruption of these major white matter pathways results
  in measurable cognitive disability across multiple domains including memory, attention,
  executive function, and processing speed'

description: This meta-analysis of 18 studies (462 AUD patients, 416 healthy controls)
  using VBM and DTI neuroimaging methods identified consistent white matter alterations
  in the corpus callosum, cingulum, fornix, and internal capsule in alcohol use disorder
  patients. These structural changes in major white matter tracts disrupt neural connectivity
  essential for cognitive functions including memory, attention, executive function,
  and motor coordination, contributing to the cognitive disability observed in AUD
  populations.
