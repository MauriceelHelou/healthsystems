direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workers are exposed to vinyl chloride monomer through inhalation or dermal
  contact in occupational settings (e.g., polyvinyl chloride production facilities)'
- 'Step 2: Vinyl chloride is metabolized in the liver to reactive intermediates (chloroethylene
  oxide and chloroacetaldehyde) that form DNA adducts and cause genotoxic damage to
  hepatocytes'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative exposure leads to progressive hepatocellular injury, with exposure-response
  relationship observed with duration of employment and cumulative exposure levels'
- 'Step 4: Chronic hepatotoxic effects combined with potential synergistic interactions
  with viral hepatitis co-infection amplify carcinogenic risk'
- 'Step 5: DNA damage and chronic liver injury promote malignant transformation, leading
  to development of hepatocellular carcinoma'

description: Occupational exposure to vinyl chloride is associated with increased
  risk of hepatocellular carcinoma based on evidence from two large multicentre mortality
  cohort studies (American and European). The European study demonstrated an exposure-response
  relationship with both duration of employment and cumulative exposure among verified
  hepatocellular carcinoma cases. Meta-analyses concluded a small excess of primary
  liver cancer, though some misclassification concerns remain. The association may
  be amplified by co-existing viral hepatitis infection.
