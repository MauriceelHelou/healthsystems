direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gut microbiota metabolize dietary nutrients (choline, carnitine, betaine)
  to produce trimethylamine (TMA), which is then oxidized to TMAO in the liver'
- 'Step 2: Elevated circulating TMAO concentrations promote systemic inflammation,
  as evidenced by positive correlations with inflammatory biomarkers'
- 'Step 3: TMAO accumulation is associated with impaired kidney function (negative
  correlation with GFR), creating a bidirectional kidney-heart damage pathway'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation and vascular dysfunction contribute to atherosclerosis
  progression and cardiovascular damage'
- 'Step 5: These cumulative effects increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality,
  particularly in vulnerable populations such as CKD patients'

description: Elevated circulating TMAO concentrations, derived from gut microbiota
  metabolism of dietary precursors, increase cardiovascular mortality risk through
  mechanisms involving systemic inflammation and kidney-heart crosstalk. Meta-analysis
  of 21 studies (n=15,637) demonstrates a linear dose-response relationship, with
  highest TMAO levels associated with 72% increased cardiovascular mortality risk
  in non-black dialysis CKD patients. The pathway involves TMAO-induced inflammation
  and vascular dysfunction, with effects modulated by kidney function and racial/ethnic
  background.
