direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose levels) creates a pro-inflammatory
  state and impairs immune function, reducing the body''s ability to mount an effective
  response against SARS-CoV-2 infection'
- 'Step 2: High blood glucose promotes viral replication and glycosylation of ACE2
  receptors, potentially enhancing viral entry and cellular damage in respiratory
  and other organ systems'
- 'Step 3: Hyperglycemia contributes to endothelial dysfunction and a hypercoagulable
  state, increasing risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac
  injury, and acute kidney injury'
- 'Step 4: These complications lead to progression from non-critical to critical COVID-19,
  increased need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and ultimately higher
  mortality rates'

description: Meta-analysis of 8 observational studies (n=2729) found that hyperglycemic
  COVID-19 patients, regardless of diabetes status, had significantly higher mortality
  (17% vs normoglycemic patients), greater ICU admission rates (11%), higher need
  for ventilation (23%), and increased risk of severe complications including ARDS
  (15%), acute cardiac injury (14%), and acute kidney injury (5%). The association
  persisted in both diabetic and non-diabetic populations, emphasizing that elevated
  blood glucose itself is a critical prognostic factor.
