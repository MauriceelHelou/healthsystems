direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with NAFLD-related HCC have distinct clinical characteristics
  including older age and higher BMI, but importantly lower rates of underlying cirrhosis
  (50.4% vs 64.0%) compared to HCC of other etiologies'
- 'Step 2: The lower prevalence of cirrhosis in NAFLD-related HCC patients results
  in better preserved liver function and hepatic reserve at the time of surgical resection'
- 'Step 3: Better baseline liver function translates to improved tolerance of hepatic
  resection surgery with similar perioperative complication and mortality rates despite
  older age'
- 'Step 4: Superior underlying liver parenchyma quality and functional reserve in
  NAFLD-related HCC patients contributes to slightly improved overall survival (HR
  0.87) and recurrence-free survival (HR 0.93) compared to other HCC etiologies'

description: Patients with NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma demonstrate slightly
  improved overall survival after hepatic resection compared to patients with HCC
  of other etiologies. This meta-analysis of 17 studies involving 11,477 patients
  found that despite being older with higher BMI, NAFLD-related HCC patients had lower
  rates of cirrhosis, similar perioperative outcomes, and a trend toward better overall
  survival (HR 0.87). The survival advantage was statistically significant in Asian
  populations specifically.
