  node_id: NEW:acute_glucose_response

direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vinegar containing acetic acid is consumed orally, typically with or before
  a carbohydrate-containing meal'
- 'Step 2: Acetic acid may delay gastric emptying, slowing the rate of carbohydrate
  absorption in the small intestine'
- 'Step 3: Acetic acid may inhibit disaccharidase activity in the intestinal brush
  border, reducing carbohydrate digestion'
- 'Step 4: These mechanisms result in a blunted postprandial glucose response, reducing
  the acute glucose peak following meal consumption'

description: Vinegar intake acutely decreases the postprandial glucose response in
  both healthy individuals and those with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes.
  A systematic review and meta-analysis of 46 studies found that vinegar significantly
  reduced acute glucose response, with stronger effects observed in metabolically
  unhealthy populations. The mechanism likely involves acetic acid's effects on gastric
  emptying and carbohydrate digestion/absorption.
