direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PM2.5 exposure causes lung injury and triggers bronchial epithelial cells
  to release small extracellular vesicles (sEV) containing miR-421'
- 'Step 2: sEV-enclosed miR-421 enters systemic circulation and is transported from
  the respiratory system to the heart'
- 'Step 3: miR-421 delivered via sEV directly targets and suppresses cardiac angiotensin
  converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression'
- 'Step 4: ACE2 suppression in cardiomyocytes leads to myocardial cell apoptosis and
  cardiac dysfunction'

description: Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) released from PM2.5-injured lung tissue
  carry miR-421 to the heart, where it directly suppresses ACE2 expression. This lung-heart
  crosstalk mechanism was demonstrated through intratracheal instillation in vivo,
  organ culture ex vivo, and human bronchial epithelial cell culture in vitro. SP-IRIS
  analysis confirmed PM2.5 increased CD63/CD81/CD9 positive particles. ACE2 was identified
  as a direct downstream target of sEV-miR421, with suppression leading to myocardial
  cell apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction.
