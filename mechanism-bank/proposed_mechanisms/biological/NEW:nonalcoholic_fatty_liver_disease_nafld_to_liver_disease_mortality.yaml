direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NAFLD initiates hepatic steatosis with fat accumulation in liver cells,
  triggering inflammatory responses and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 2: Chronic hepatic inflammation leads to progressive fibrosis, with documented
  incidence of 49.0 per 1,000 person-years for fibrosis progression'
- 'Step 3: Continued fibrosis advances to cirrhosis (incidence 10.9 per 1,000 person-years),
  with decompensated cirrhosis rates increasing over time'
- 'Step 4: Advanced liver disease may progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (incidence
  3.39 per 1,000 person-years) or require liver transplant (incidence 12.0 per 1,000
  person-years)'
- 'Step 5: Terminal liver complications result in liver-related mortality at an incidence
  of 3.10 per 1,000 person-years'

description: NAFLD progresses through a well-documented cascade of liver damage leading
  to mortality. This meta-analysis of 79 studies (1,377,466 persons) quantified incidence
  rates showing liver-related mortality at 3.10 per 1,000 person-years, with intermediate
  events including fibrosis progression (49.0), cirrhosis (10.9), HCC (3.39), and
  liver transplant (12.0) per 1,000 person-years. The overall incidence of liver-related
  events was 24.3 per 1,000 person-years.
