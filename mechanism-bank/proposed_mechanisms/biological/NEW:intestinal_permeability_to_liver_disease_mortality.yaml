direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut) allows translocation of bacterial
  products, endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides), and microbial metabolites from the gut
  lumen into the portal circulation'
- 'Step 2: These translocated bacterial products reach the liver via portal blood
  flow, triggering hepatic immune responses and activating Kupffer cells and hepatic
  stellate cells'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to gut-derived endotoxins induces persistent hepatic inflammation,
  characterized by elevated cytokine production and inflammatory cascades'
- 'Step 4: Sustained hepatic inflammation promotes progressive liver damage including
  alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma'
- 'Step 5: Progressive liver disease from these pathological processes increases risk
  of liver-related mortality'

description: Increased intestinal permeability allows bacterial endotoxins and metabolites
  to translocate from the gut to the liver via portal circulation. This triggers chronic
  hepatic inflammation and immune activation, promoting progression through alcohol-related
  liver diseases including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, ultimately
  increasing liver disease mortality risk.
