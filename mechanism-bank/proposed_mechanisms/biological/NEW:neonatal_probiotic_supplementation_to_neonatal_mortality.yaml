direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Probiotic supplementation introduces beneficial microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus,
  Bifidobacterium species) to the neonatal gastrointestinal tract'
- 'Step 2: These probiotics colonize the gut and compete with pathogenic bacteria
  for nutrients and adhesion sites, reducing pathogen proliferation'
- 'Step 3: Probiotics enhance gut barrier function and reduce intestinal permeability,
  preventing bacterial translocation'
- 'Step 4: Immune modulation occurs through stimulation of secretory IgA production
  and regulation of inflammatory cytokines'
- 'Step 5: Reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) by 54% through protection
  of intestinal mucosal integrity'
- 'Step 6: Reduced incidence of neonatal sepsis by 22% through prevention of systemic
  bacterial infection'
- 'Step 7: Combined reduction in life-threatening conditions leads to 20% reduction
  in all-cause neonatal mortality'

description: Probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period reduces all-cause
  mortality by 20% in preterm and/or low birth weight neonates in hospital settings
  in LMICs. This effect is mediated primarily through substantial reductions in necrotizing
  enterocolitis (54% reduction, NNT=17) and neonatal sepsis (22% reduction, NNT=14).
  The number needed to treat to prevent one death is 100. Evidence quality is high
  with no statistical heterogeneity (I²=0%) and symmetrical funnel plot suggesting
  low publication bias.
