direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher AUD polygenic risk score reflects cumulative genetic liability for
  alcohol use disorder, capturing variants in genes affecting reward processing, impulse
  control, and addiction pathways'
- 'Step 2: Shared genetic architecture between alcohol and nicotine addiction leads
  to pleiotropic effects, where genetic variants influencing AUD risk also affect
  smoking susceptibility'
- 'Step 3: Common neurobiological substrates including dopaminergic reward pathways
  and stress response systems mediate the genetic correlation between alcohol and
  tobacco use'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with higher AUD genetic liability show increased propensity
  for ever smoking and greater tobacco consumption (pack years), indicating cross-substance
  genetic risk'

description: AUD polygenic risk score shows significant positive association with
  smoking status, demonstrating genetic pleiotropy between alcohol and tobacco use
  disorders. In an independent East Asian sample (GERA cohort), higher AUD PRS was
  associated with both ever vs. never smoking (beta=0.06, p=0.0114) and pack years
  of smoking (beta=0.09, p=0.0452), indicating shared genetic liability for these
  substances.
