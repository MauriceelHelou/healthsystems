direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Anxiety disorders involve chronic activation of stress response systems
  and dysregulation of cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits'
- 'Step 2: Sustained anxiety-related neural activity and neurochemical changes affect
  deep gray matter structures including the amygdala, hippocampus, and basal ganglia'
- 'Step 3: Chronic dysregulation leads to morphological changes in subcortical structures,
  manifesting as shape abnormalities detectable through neuroimaging'
- 'Step 4: These subcortical shape abnormalities reflect structural remodeling associated
  with anxiety comorbidity and may contribute to symptom persistence'

description: This meta-analysis by the OCD Brain Imaging Consortium examined subcortical
  brain structure shape abnormalities and their relationship with comorbid anxiety
  disorders. The study specifically investigated how anxiety comorbidity relates to
  morphological changes in deep gray matter structures, highlighting the neurobiological
  substrates linking anxiety disorders to subcortical shape alterations. The consortium
  approach allowed for robust analysis across multiple international sites.
