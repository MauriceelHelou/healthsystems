- 'Step 1: Biological sex differences modulate neurotransmitter systems (dopamine,
  corticotropin releasing factor, glutamate) that regulate reward, stress, and executive
  function'
- 'Step 2: Sex-specific differences in neural pathway connectivity between prefrontal
  and limbic structures affect vulnerability to alcohol''s neurobiological effects'
- 'Step 3: Differential modulation of the three addiction stages (binge/intoxication,
  withdrawal/negative affect, preoccupation/anticipation) leads to sex-specific patterns
  of AUD development'
- 'Step 4: These neurobiological sex differences result in varying susceptibility
  to alcohol-induced brain changes that drive AUD progression'

description: Biological sex differences play a critical role in modulating how chronic
  or heavy alcohol use impacts the brain and leads to AUD development. These differences
  operate through sex-specific patterns in neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, corticotropin
  releasing factor, glutamate) and neural pathways connecting prefrontal and limbic
  structures that regulate executive function, memory, and stress responses. The three-stage
  addiction framework reveals differential vulnerability across sexes at each stage
  of AUD progression.
