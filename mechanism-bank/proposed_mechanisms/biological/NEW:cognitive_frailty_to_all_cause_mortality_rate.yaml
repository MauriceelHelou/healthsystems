category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cognitive frailty represents the co-occurrence of physical frailty (reduced
  strength, endurance, physical function) and mild cognitive impairment without dementia'
- 'Step 2: The combined syndrome leads to impaired self-care capacity, reduced ability
  to manage chronic conditions, medication non-adherence, and decreased healthcare
  utilization efficiency'
- 'Step 3: Physical frailty components contribute to sarcopenia, immune dysfunction,
  and reduced physiological reserve, while cognitive impairment affects decision-making
  and risk awareness'
- 'Step 4: This dual vulnerability accelerates functional decline, increases susceptibility
  to acute illness, falls, and hospitalization'
- 'Step 5: The synergistic effect of physical and cognitive decline results in significantly
  elevated mortality risk compared to either condition alone'

description: Cognitive frailty, defined as the simultaneous presence of physical frailty
  and mild cognitive impairment (excluding dementia), significantly increases all-cause
  mortality risk in community-dwelling older adults. This meta-analysis of 22 cohort
  studies found that cognitive frailty was associated with a 2.41-fold increased risk
  of mortality compared to robust elders, demonstrating a stronger effect than either
  frailty (RR=2.11) or mild cognitive impairment with pre-frailty (RR=1.74) alone.
