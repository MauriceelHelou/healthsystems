direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to hepatic metabolism of ethanol primarily
  through alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) pathways'
- 'Step 2: CYP2E1 metabolism of ethanol generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) including
  superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals'
- 'Step 3: Acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol oxidation, further contributes
  to ROS generation and forms protein adducts that impair antioxidant defenses'
- 'Step 4: Chronic alcohol exposure depletes hepatic glutathione (GSH) and reduces
  activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase)'
- 'Step 5: Resulting oxidative stress causes lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and hepatocyte injury, contributing to the pathogenesis of alcohol-related liver
  disease'

description: Alcohol use disorder induces hepatic oxidative stress through multiple
  interconnected pathways. Chronic ethanol consumption upregulates CYP2E1, which generates
  reactive oxygen species during alcohol metabolism. Additionally, acetaldehyde accumulation,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, and depletion of endogenous antioxidant systems (particularly
  glutathione) create a pro-oxidant hepatic environment. This oxidative stress is
  recognized as a critical early mechanism in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related
  liver disease, contributing to lipid peroxidation, hepatocyte injury, and progression
  to more severe liver pathology.
