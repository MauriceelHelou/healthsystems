direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parkinson''s disease involves progressive neurodegeneration affecting dopaminergic
  pathways in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra and associated limbic
  circuits'
- 'Step 2: Dopaminergic dysfunction contributes to high prevalence of mood disorders,
  especially depression, in patients with Parkinson''s disease'
- 'Step 3: The combination of neurobiological changes, chronic progressive disability,
  motor impairment, and comorbid depression increases vulnerability to suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Suicidal ideation (present in 22.2% of PD patients) can progress to suicidal
  behavior, with PD patients having approximately twice the risk of suicidal behavior
  compared to controls'

description: This meta-analysis of 28 studies comprising over 500,000 Parkinson's
  disease patients found that 22.2% experienced suicidal ideation and 1.25% exhibited
  suicidal behavior. Patients with PD had approximately twice the odds (OR 2.15) and
  73% higher hazard (HR 1.73) of suicidal behavior compared to controls. The relationship
  is driven by neurobiological changes affecting mood regulation and the psychological
  burden of chronic progressive neurodegeneration.
