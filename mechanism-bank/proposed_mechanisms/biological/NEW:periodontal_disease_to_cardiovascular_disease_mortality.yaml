direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Periodontal disease creates chronic oral infection with bacterial pathogens
  entering systemic circulation through inflamed and ulcerated gingival tissues'
- 'Step 2: Systemic bacteremia and inflammatory mediators from periodontal infection
  trigger chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, elevating inflammatory markers
  (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α)'
- 'Step 3: Chronic systemic inflammation promotes endothelial dysfunction, accelerates
  atherosclerotic plaque formation and destabilization in coronary and cerebral arteries'
- 'Step 4: Advanced atherosclerosis and plaque rupture lead to major adverse cardiovascular
  events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death'

description: 'Periodontal disease is associated with a 42% increased risk of cardiac
  death (RR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.84). This meta-analysis of 39 prospective cohort
  studies comprising over 4.3 million individuals demonstrates that periodontal disease
  elevates risk across multiple cardiovascular outcomes including major adverse cardiovascular
  events (RR: 1.24), coronary heart disease (RR: 1.20), myocardial infarction (RR:
  1.14), and stroke (RR: 1.26). The biological mechanism involves chronic oral bacterial
  infection leading to systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and accelerated
  atherosclerosis.'
