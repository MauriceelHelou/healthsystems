mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis
  and improving lipid metabolism in the liver'
- 'Step 2: Statins exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and systemic inflammation in NASH patients'
- 'Step 3: Statins demonstrate antifibrotic properties, reducing hepatic stellate
  cell activation and collagen deposition'
- 'Step 4: Statins modulate intestinal microbiota composition, reducing harmful inflammatory
  bacteria and gut-derived endotoxins'
- 'Step 5: The combined lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and microbiome-modulating
  effects reduce hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis characteristic of NASH'

description: Statins provide multifaceted therapeutic benefits in NASH through their
  primary lipid-modulating effects combined with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic
  properties. Beyond cholesterol reduction, statins reduce hepatic inflammation, inhibit
  fibrosis progression, and modulate the gut microbiota to reduce systemic inflammation.
  This systematic review synthesizes evidence from human and animal studies demonstrating
  statin safety and efficacy in NAFLD/NASH populations.
