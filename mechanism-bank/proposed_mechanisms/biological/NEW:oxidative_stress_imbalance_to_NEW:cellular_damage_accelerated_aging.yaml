direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorders create an imbalance between reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production and antioxidant defenses, resulting in elevated oxidant markers
  (malondialdehyde, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, lipid peroxidation products)'
- 'Step 2: Simultaneously, antioxidant defenses are depleted, evidenced by reduced
  superoxide dismutase activity and diminished total antioxidant capacity/status'
- 'Step 3: The oxidative imbalance leads to direct cellular damage through lipid peroxidation
  of cell membranes, protein oxidation, and DNA damage'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative cellular damage from sustained oxidative stress contributes
  to accelerated aging processes and development of multiple associated comorbidities'

description: Substance use disorders create a clear oxidative imbalance characterized
  by elevated oxidant markers (malondialdehyde, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances,
  lipid peroxidation) and reduced antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase, total
  antioxidant capacity). This imbalance leads to cellular damage through oxidation
  of lipids, proteins, and DNA, ultimately contributing to accelerated aging and multiple
  comorbidities. The effect is particularly pronounced in alcohol use disorder and
  may be partially reversible during abstinence.
