  node_id: NEW:covid_19_hospitalization_rate

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use disorder compromises immune system function, reducing
  the body''s ability to mount effective responses to viral infections'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced damage to respiratory epithelium and impaired mucociliary
  clearance increases susceptibility to respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2'
- 'Step 3: AUD increases risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
  and exacerbates pneumonia severity during COVID-19 infection'
- 'Step 4: Comorbidities commonly associated with AUD (liver disease, cardiovascular
  conditions) compound COVID-19 severity'
- 'Step 5: More severe COVID-19 disease progression leads to increased need for hospitalization
  among AUD patients'

description: Individuals with alcohol use disorder have 51% higher odds of requiring
  hospitalization when infected with COVID-19 compared to those without AUD, even
  after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, BMI, and comorbidities. This
  relationship is attributed to known mechanisms by which AUD increases severity of
  respiratory infections, including impaired immune function, increased susceptibility
  to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and enhanced pneumonia severity.
