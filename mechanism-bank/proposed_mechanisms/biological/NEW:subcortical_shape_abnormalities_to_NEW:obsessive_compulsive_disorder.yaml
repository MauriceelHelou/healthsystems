category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural abnormalities develop in deep gray matter subcortical structures
  including the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus), thalamus, and limbic
  structures (amygdala, hippocampus)'
- 'Step 2: Shape deformations in these structures disrupt cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical
  (CSTC) circuit integrity and connectivity'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted CSTC circuits impair the brain''s ability to properly filter
  and inhibit intrusive thoughts and regulate repetitive behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Impaired inhibitory control and aberrant error signaling manifest as obsessions
  (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) characteristic of OCD'

description: This meta-analysis by the OCD Brain Imaging Consortium examined subcortical
  structure shape abnormalities in OCD patients, finding significant shape deformations
  in deep gray matter structures that are central to the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical
  circuits implicated in OCD pathophysiology. The relationship between these shape
  abnormalities and OCD was found to be moderated by comorbid anxiety, depression,
  and medication use.
