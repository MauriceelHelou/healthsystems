direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dexmedetomidine is administered as adjunctive therapy to standard care
  (typically benzodiazepines) for alcohol withdrawal syndrome management'
- 'Step 2: Dexmedetomidine acts as a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor
  agonist in the central nervous system, particularly in the locus coeruleus'
- 'Step 3: Alpha-2 receptor activation reduces sympathetic outflow from the central
  nervous system, leading to decreased norepinephrine release'
- 'Step 4: Reduced sympathetic tone causes decreased heart rate through reduced stimulation
  of cardiac beta-1 adrenergic receptors'
- 'Step 5: The combined effect of central sympatholytic activity results in bradycardia
  as an adverse event'

description: Dexmedetomidine, when used as adjunctive therapy for alcohol withdrawal
  syndrome, increases the risk of bradycardia as an adverse event. This systematic
  review and meta-analysis included seven studies examining bradycardia as a secondary
  outcome. The mechanism is mediated through dexmedetomidine's action as a selective
  alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, which reduces central sympathetic outflow and leads
  to decreased heart rate. While dexmedetomidine offers advantages over benzodiazepines
  by not causing respiratory depression, clinicians must monitor for cardiovascular
  adverse events including bradycardia.
