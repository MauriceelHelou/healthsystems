direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic hyperglycemia (FBG >150 mg/dl) leads to sustained elevated blood
  glucose levels in the circulation'
- 'Step 2: Elevated glucose causes glycation of proteins and formation of advanced
  glycation end products (AGEs) that damage renal vasculature and glomerular basement
  membrane'
- 'Step 3: Hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress and inflammation in renal tissues,
  contributing to mesangial expansion and glomerular hyperfiltration'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged exposure causes progressive nephron damage, reduced glomerular
  filtration rate (GFR), and eventual chronic kidney disease development'

description: Poor glycemic control, defined as fasting blood glucose >150 mg/dl, significantly
  increases the risk of chronic kidney disease among diabetic patients. This meta-analysis
  of 12 studies with 4,075 participants in Ethiopia found that poor glycemic control
  more than doubles the odds of developing CKD (OR=2.58). The mechanism involves chronic
  hyperglycemia-induced damage to renal microvasculature through advanced glycation
  end products, oxidative stress, and inflammation, leading to progressive nephropathy.
