direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bipolar disorder is associated with metabolic dysregulation, including
  higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, partly due to medication side
  effects and lifestyle factors during mood episodes'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation
  associated with bipolar disorder contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Behavioral risk factors including smoking, physical inactivity, poor diet,
  and substance use are elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare access barriers and diagnostic overshadowing lead to underdiagnosis
  and undertreatment of cardiovascular conditions in people with bipolar disorder'
- 'Step 5: These combined biological, behavioral, and healthcare system factors result
  in elevated cardiovascular disease mortality risk (RR = 1.76)'

description: Individuals with bipolar disorder have a 76% increased risk of cardiovascular
  disease mortality compared to the general population. This elevated risk reflects
  the interplay of metabolic side effects from mood-stabilizing and antipsychotic
  medications, chronic physiological stress responses, higher prevalence of cardiovascular
  risk behaviors, and systemic barriers to adequate physical healthcare. The meta-analysis
  synthesizing 27 studies representing over 678,000 individuals with bipolar disorder
  demonstrates robust evidence for this association.
