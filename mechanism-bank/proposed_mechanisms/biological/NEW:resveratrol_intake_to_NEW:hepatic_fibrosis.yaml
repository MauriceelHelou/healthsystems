category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Resveratrol is absorbed and reaches hepatic tissue where it exerts antioxidative
  properties'
- 'Step 2: Resveratrol reduces oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in hepatocytes
  through multiple pathways'
- 'Step 3: Decreased oxidative damage reduces hepatic stellate cell activation, which
  is the primary driver of fibrogenesis'
- 'Step 4: Resveratrol modulates insulin resistance and improves lipid metabolism,
  reducing hepatic steatosis that precedes fibrosis'
- 'Step 5: Combined anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and metabolic effects lead to
  reduced collagen deposition and hepatic fibrosis'

description: This systematic review of 76 preclinical studies demonstrates that resveratrol
  reduces hepatic fibrosis through its antioxidative properties across different models
  of hepatitis and liver injury. The compound provides hepatoprotection against chemical,
  cholestatic, and alcohol-induced injury while improving glucose metabolism and lipid
  profiles. These metabolic improvements, combined with direct antioxidant effects,
  lead to reduced hepatic stellate cell activation and diminished fibrogenesis.
