direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ethanol enters the brain and is oxidized by catalase enzyme to produce
  acetaldehyde intracerebrally'
- 'Step 2: Brain acetaldehyde binds non-enzymatically to dopamine, forming salsolinol
  (specifically the R-salsolinol enantiomer)'
- 'Step 3: Salsolinol is self-administered by animals and generates marked sensitization
  to the motivational effects of ethanol'
- 'Step 4: This acetaldehyde-salsolinol pathway mediates 80-95% of ethanol''s reinforcing
  effects and promotes acquisition of alcohol intake and binge-like drinking behavior'

description: Catalase-mediated oxidation of ethanol in the brain produces acetaldehyde,
  which is an absolute requirement (accounting for 80-95% of the effect) for rats
  to display ethanol's reinforcing properties and initiate chronic alcohol intake.
  Acetaldehyde non-enzymatically binds to dopamine forming salsolinol, which generates
  sensitization to ethanol's motivational effects and promotes binge-like drinking.
  This mechanism is specific to the acquisition phase of alcohol drinking behavior.

    of chronic ethanol intake, though prolonged withdrawal partly returns the requirement
