direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher infant fat mass during the first 2 years of life establishes an
  elevated adipose tissue baseline that tracks into childhood'
- 'Step 2: Early adipocyte hyperplasia (increased fat cell number) and/or hypertrophy
  (increased fat cell size) during infancy creates a biological predisposition for
  continued fat accumulation'
- 'Step 3: Metabolic programming during the infant period influences hormonal regulation
  (including leptin and insulin signaling) that affects appetite regulation and energy
  balance in later childhood'
- 'Step 4: The tracking of adiposity from infancy results in persistently elevated
  BMI measurements in childhood and adolescence (outcomes measured from 2-16 years)'

description: This systematic review of 30 high-quality studies found that infant fat
  mass (measured 0-2 years using methods other than BMI) is positively associated
  with later BMI in childhood and adolescence. Five studies specifically examined
  the infant fat mass to later BMI relationship, representing one of the strongest
  and most consistent associations identified in the review. The tracking of adiposity
  from infancy to later childhood suggests biological programming of body composition
  during early life.
