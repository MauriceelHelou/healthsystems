direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Developing regions experience structural economic disadvantages including
  lower per-capita income, limited social safety nets, and reduced access to resources
  and services'
- 'Step 2: Economic vulnerability in these regions leads to increased household financial
  stress, resource scarcity, and limited economic independence for women'
- 'Step 3: Limited institutional capacity in developing regions results in weaker
  protective systems including fewer legal protections, reduced access to shelters,
  and inadequate enforcement of domestic violence laws'
- 'Step 4: During crises like COVID-19, these structural vulnerabilities are amplified
  as economic pressures intensify and protective services become further strained'
- 'Step 5: The combination of economic stress, gender inequality, and weak institutional
  protections results in significantly higher rates of intimate partner violence in
  developing regions'

description: Women living in developing regions experience significantly higher rates
  of intimate partner violence compared to those in developed regions, with meta-analytic
  evidence showing 33% prevalence in developing regions versus 14% in developed regions
  during the COVID-19 pandemic. This disparity reflects structural economic inequalities
  including limited resources, weaker institutional protections, and greater economic
  dependency of women in developing contexts.
