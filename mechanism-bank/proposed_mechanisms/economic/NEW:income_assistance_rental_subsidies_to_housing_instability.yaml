  to individuals experiencing homelessness or housing instability'
- 'Step 2: These financial resources reduce the gap between housing costs and available
  income, making rental payments more affordable'
- 'Step 3: Reduced financial burden enables individuals to secure and maintain stable
  housing arrangements'
- 'Step 4: Sustained housing subsidies prevent eviction and loss of housing due to
  inability to pay rent'
- 'Step 5: Housing stability is achieved through continued financial support, reducing
  episodes of homelessness'

description: Income assistance, particularly in the form of rental subsidies, appears
  to have benefits in improving housing stability among people experiencing homelessness.
  The systematic review found that financial assistance helps individuals secure and
  maintain housing by directly addressing the affordability gap. However, no consistent
  impact on other outcomes such as quality of life, substance use, hospitalizations,
  employment status, or earned income was detected when compared with usual services.
  Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that benefits from temporary financial assistance
  outweighed costs, with a net savings of US$20,548.
