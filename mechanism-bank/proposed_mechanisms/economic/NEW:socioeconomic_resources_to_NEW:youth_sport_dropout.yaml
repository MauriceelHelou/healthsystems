mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher socioeconomic background provides greater financial resources for
  sport participation costs including equipment, fees, travel, and specialized coaching'
- 'Step 2: Youth from resourceful socioeconomic backgrounds have enhanced capacity
  to maintain consistent training schedules and access wealth-consuming sports activities'
- 'Step 3: Economic resources buffer against dropout pressures by enabling continued
  participation despite rising costs associated with competitive sport progression'
- 'Step 4: Lower dropout rates result from sustained ability to ''keep up the pace''
  with training demands and participation requirements in organized youth sports'

description: Individuals with more resourceful socioeconomic backgrounds find it easier
  to maintain sport participation and have the opportunity to participate in more
  wealth-consuming sports, resulting in lower dropout rates. Economic resources enable
  sustained access to equipment, coaching, facilities, and time for training that
  prevent attrition from organized youth sports.
