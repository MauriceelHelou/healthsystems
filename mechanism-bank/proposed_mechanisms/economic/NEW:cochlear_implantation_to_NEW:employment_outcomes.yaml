- 'Step 1: Cochlear implantation restores functional hearing ability in adults with
  severe to profound hearing loss'
- 'Step 2: Improved hearing enhances communication capabilities in workplace settings,
  enabling better interaction with colleagues, supervisors, and clients'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced communication and auditory function increases ability to participate
  in job-related activities, meetings, and training'
- 'Step 4: Improved workplace functioning leads to better employment outcomes including
  job acquisition, retention, and advancement opportunities'

description: Systematic review of 44 studies examining cochlear implantation effects
  on social outcomes found that 85.7% of studies (18 out of 21 studies examining work/employment)
  showed improvements in employment outcomes following cochlear implantation. The
  mechanism operates through restored hearing function enabling improved workplace
  communication and social participation, which translates to better job acquisition
  and retention. The review included cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and
  qualitative research, though all studies had some risk of bias.
