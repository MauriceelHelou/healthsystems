direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher grocery store density in neighborhoods increases physical proximity
  and accessibility to retail outlets selling fresh produce, whole grains, and other
  healthy food options'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability reduces barriers to purchasing healthy foods (time,
  transportation costs, effort), making nutritious options more convenient for residents'
- 'Step 3: Greater exposure to and access to healthy food options facilitates healthier
  food purchasing decisions and dietary patterns'
- 'Step 4: Improved food purchasing translates to higher consumption of fruits, vegetables,
  and nutrient-dense foods, resulting in better overall diet quality scores'

description: Systematic review evidence from 14 studies (10 rated as good quality)
  demonstrates a consistent positive association between food availability characteristics
  in the neighborhood environment and dietary behavior outcomes. Higher density of
  food retail outlets offering healthy options facilitates access to nutritious foods,
  reducing structural barriers and enabling healthier dietary patterns among urban
  residents.
