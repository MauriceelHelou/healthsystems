  node_id: homicide_rate

direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of off-premise outlets (liquor stores) in neighborhoods increases take-home
  alcohol availability'
- 'Step 2: Off-premise outlets facilitate higher volume alcohol purchases and consumption in private settings'
- 'Step 3: Liquor stores in residential areas create gathering points that may attract crime and disorder'
- 'Step 4: Increased neighborhood-level alcohol consumption elevates community violence risk'
- 'Step 5: Resulting interpersonal conflicts and violence lead to increased homicide rates'

description: Off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores) show the strongest association with homicide
  (IRR=1.76). Removing liquor stores from residential zones could prevent an estimated 22 homicides per
  year in Baltimore, representing $27.5 million in costs and 391 DALYs.

  description: Removing liquor stores specifically from residential zones was associated with 22 fewer
    homicides annually, indicating residential placement amplifies harm
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how land use and zoning policies differentially locate
    liquor stores in residential neighborhoods, often concentrated in lower-income communities and communities
    of color. The policy solution - restricting liquor store placement in residential zones - is a structural
    intervention that modifies the built environment rather than attempting to change individual drinking
    behavior.
