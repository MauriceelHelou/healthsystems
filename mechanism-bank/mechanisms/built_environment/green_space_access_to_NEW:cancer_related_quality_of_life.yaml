- 'Step 1: Access to greenspaces enables engagement with nature-based interventions
  (NBIs) including forest bathing, green exercise, gardening, and nature viewing'
- 'Step 2: These nature-based activities promote stress reduction, physical activity,
  and psychological restoration through exposure to natural environments'
- 'Step 3: Reduced stress and increased physical activity contribute to improved mental
  well-being and reduced symptom burden in cancer patients'
- 'Step 4: The combined physiological and psychological benefits result in enhanced
  cancer-related quality of life measures'

description: Systematic review evidence from 5 experimental studies examining cancer-related
  outcomes indicates that nature-based interventions and greenspace access have beneficial
  effects on cancer-related quality of life. The review found that interventions including
  forest bathing, green exercise, gardening, and nature viewing were associated with
  improved quality of life outcomes in cancer patients. The overall risk of bias across
  included studies was low, strengthening confidence in these findings.
