mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to greenspaces enables nature-based interventions including forest
  bathing, green exercise, gardening, and nature viewing'
- 'Step 2: These nature-based activities promote physical activity, reduce psychological
  stress, and provide restorative environmental experiences'
- 'Step 3: Physiological responses include reduced sympathetic nervous system activation
  and improved autonomic regulation'
- 'Step 4: These combined effects lead to reductions in blood pressure and improved
  cardiovascular health markers'

description: Systematic review of 31 experimental studies (26 on cardiovascular outcomes)
  found that nature-based interventions including forest bathing, green exercise,
  gardening, and nature viewing have beneficial effects on blood pressure. The review
  indicates that greenspace access facilitates physical activity, stress reduction,
  and physiological improvements that support blood pressure control.
