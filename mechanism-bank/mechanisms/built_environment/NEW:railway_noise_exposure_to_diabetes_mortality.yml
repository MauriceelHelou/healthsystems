mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic residential exposure to railway noise disrupts sleep patterns and causes intermittent
  arousal'
- 'Step 2: Sleep disruption and chronic stress response activate neuroendocrine pathways'
- 'Step 3: Metabolic dysregulation develops through insulin resistance and glucose intolerance mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Progressive metabolic dysfunction contributes to diabetes and its complications'
- 'Step 5: Diabetes-related complications increase mortality risk'

description: Long-term exposure to railway noise shows a statistically significant association with diabetes
  mortality, with a 2% increase in hazard per 10 dB increase. Unlike road traffic noise, no threshold
  effect was observed, suggesting even lower levels of railway noise may contribute to risk.

  equity_implications: Railway infrastructure placement often follows historical patterns that concentrated
    industrial and transportation corridors near working-class neighborhoods. The lack of a threshold
    effect for railway noise suggests that current approaches to noise mitigation may not adequately address
    cumulative exposures from multiple transportation sources.
