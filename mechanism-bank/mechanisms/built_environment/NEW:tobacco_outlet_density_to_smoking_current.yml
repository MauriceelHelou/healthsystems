direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher tobacco retailer density increases physical accessibility of tobacco products'
- 'Step 2: Greater supply creates competitive market that may reduce tobacco product costs'
- 'Step 3: Increased visibility of tobacco products and brands raises awareness and normalizes smoking'
- 'Step 4: Local social norms shift to favor tobacco use when retail access is ubiquitous'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of smoking initiation and maintenance of current smoking'

description: Higher density of tobacco retail outlets per 10,000 population is associated with increased
  tobacco accessibility, contributing to tobacco-related harm through increased supply, potential price
  competition, brand awareness, and normalized consumption patterns.

  description: Most deprived quintile of neighbourhoods had highest density of tobacco outlets; least
    deprived had lowest density (p<0.001)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies the retail environment as a structural determinant of
    smoking behavior, shifting focus from individual willpower to environmental factors. The concentration
    of tobacco retailers in deprived areas represents a commercial determinant of health that exacerbates
    socioeconomic inequities in smoking prevalence.
