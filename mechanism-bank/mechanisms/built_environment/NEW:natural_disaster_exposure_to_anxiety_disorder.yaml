direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to natural disasters (floods, cyclones, heatwaves, river erosion)
  causes immediate physical threats, property damage, displacement, and loss of livelihoods'
- 'Step 2: These traumatic experiences trigger acute stress responses and activate
  fear-based neural pathways, while ongoing environmental instability creates persistent
  uncertainty'
- 'Step 3: Socioeconomic consequences including income loss, food insecurity, displacement,
  and loss of social support networks compound psychological distress'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure to disaster-related stressors and inadequate recovery
  resources lead to sustained hypervigilance and worry about future disasters'
- 'Step 5: Prolonged stress response manifests as clinical anxiety disorders including
  generalized anxiety disorder, with prevalence ranging from 6% to 92.19% among affected
  populations'

description: Natural disaster exposure significantly increases risk of anxiety disorders
  through multiple pathways including direct trauma, economic devastation, displacement,
  and loss of social support. A systematic review of 17 studies in Bangladesh found
  anxiety prevalence ranging from 6% to 92.19% among disaster-affected populations,
  with various demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors moderating the
  relationship.
