direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing quality creates multiple indoor environmental hazards (dampness, mold, inadequate
  ventilation, pest infestations)'
- 'Step 2: These hazards degrade indoor air quality through allergen accumulation and respiratory irritants'
- 'Step 3: Children experience chronic exposure to airborne allergens and irritants in their primary living
  environment'
- 'Step 4: Repeated respiratory system exposure triggers inflammatory responses and airway hyperresponsiveness'
- 'Step 5: Sustained inflammation leads to asthma development and increased exacerbation frequency'

    in poor-quality housing
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects how housing policy failures (weak building codes, insufficient
    inspection enforcement, lack of remediation funding) create health inequities. Low-income families
    are disproportionately exposed to poor housing quality due to residential segregation and limited
    housing options. This represents environmental injustice, not individual choice.
