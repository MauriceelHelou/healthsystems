mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Natural disasters (floods, cyclones, heatwaves, river erosion) cause direct
  physical damage to homes, land, livestock, and infrastructure, resulting in displacement
  and loss of livelihood'
- 'Step 2: Disaster exposure triggers multiple psychosocial stressors including financial
  hardship from income loss, food insecurity, family conflicts, death of family members,
  and loss of social support networks'
- 'Step 3: These compounding traumatic experiences and chronic stressors overwhelm
  individual coping capacity, leading to development of depression and other mental
  health conditions (anxiety, PTSD, stress disorders)'
- 'Step 4: Demographic vulnerabilities (age, gender, marital status, lower education)
  and socioeconomic factors (lower social class, vulnerable livelihoods) moderate
  and often amplify the pathway from disaster exposure to depression'

description: Systematic review of 17 studies from Bangladesh demonstrates that exposure
  to natural disasters (floods, cyclones, heatwaves, river erosion) significantly
  increases risk of depression, with prevalence ranging from 16.3% to 92.71% among
  affected populations. The pathway operates through direct trauma, loss of property
  and livelihood, displacement, food insecurity, and erosion of social support systems.
  Multiple demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors moderate this relationship.
