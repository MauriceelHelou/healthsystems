  disruption of fetal lung development and epigenetic modifications that increase lifelong respiratory

  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates intergenerational transmission of environmental injustice.
    Pregnant women's exposure to air pollution reflects structural constraints on residential choice,
    with low-income women and women of color more likely to live in polluted areas. The fetus bears the
    health consequences of environmental racism and inadequate pollution control policies that preceded
    their birth.
