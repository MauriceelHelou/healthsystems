- 'Step 1: Chronic air pollution exposure damages parental germline cells before conception'
- 'Step 2: Pollutants create oxidative stress and epigenetic modifications in reproductive cells'
- 'Step 3: Environmental damage is encoded in sperm or egg cells'
- 'Step 4: Modified genetic material affects fetal respiratory development programming'
- 'Step 5: Increased respiratory disease susceptibility manifests in offspring'

description: Parental exposure to air pollution before conception creates oxidative damage and epigenetic
  modifications in germline cells that compromise respiratory health in offspring through intergenerational
  environmental health transmission.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism illustrates how environmental policy failures (weak air quality
    standards, inadequate industrial regulation) create intergenerational health inequities. Air pollution
    exposure results from zoning decisions, transportation policy, and industrial siting - not individual
    choices. Equity implication: Communities of color and low-income areas face disproportionate air pollution
    exposure due to environmental racism and lack of political power, creating compounded intergenerational
    respiratory health burdens.'
