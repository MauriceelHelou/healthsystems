- 'Step 1: Licensing restrictions contain alcohol outlet density and operating hours in local areas'
- 'Step 2: Reduced physical and temporal availability decreases population-level alcohol access'
- 'Step 3: Decreased access reduces aggregate alcohol consumption at population level'
- 'Step 4: Lower population consumption reduces alcohol-attributable morbidity and mortality'

description: 'The study documents that public health stakeholders taking a ''challenging'' approach focus
  on reducing alcohol availability to reduce health harms, citing international evidence on availability-harm
  links. However, the study critically notes that current licensing systems structurally limit effectiveness:
  alcohol availability may be contained but cannot be reduced because existing licensed premises cannot
  be closed solely on availability grounds. This represents a fundamental structural constraint on public
  health action within current policy frameworks.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism appropriately identifies alcohol availability as a structural determinant
    of population health, consistent with evidence that environmental alcohol access shapes consumption
    patterns independent of individual choices. The study identifies a critical structural barrier: licensing
    systems are designed primarily to regulate business operations rather than to optimize population
    health. The inability to reduce (versus contain) availability represents a policy design flaw from
    a public health perspective. Equity implications include differential alcohol outlet density in lower-income
    and minority neighborhoods, which current licensing systems may perpetuate even with public health
    engagement.'
