direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher urban population growth reflects rapid urbanization and demographic transitions'
- 'Step 2: Rapidly urbanizing areas may have different social structures and drug market dynamics'
- 'Step 3: Urban growth contexts may delay initiation of injecting due to different drug availability
  or social conditions'
- 'Step 4: Older age at initiation in rapidly urbanizing contexts reflects structural protective factors'

description: Higher urban population growth is associated with older age at initiation of injecting drug
  use, with each 1% annual urban population change corresponding to 1.40 years older age at initiation.

  equity_implications: Urbanization patterns reflect macroeconomic and demographic forces that shape drug
    use initiation pathways. This structural perspective identifies how built environment and population
    dynamics influence substance use patterns beyond individual vulnerability.
