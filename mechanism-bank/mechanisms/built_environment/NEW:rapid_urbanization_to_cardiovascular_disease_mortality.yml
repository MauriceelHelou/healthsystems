- 'Step 1: Urban population projected to increase from 3.6 billion (2011) to 6.3 billion (2050)'
- 'Step 2: Most population growth concentrated in cities of less developed regions'
- 'Step 3: Urbanization brings lifestyle changes and exposure patterns associated with cardiovascular
  disease risk'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare systems in these areas are already struggling and unable to absorb additional demand'
- 'Step 5: Increased cardiovascular disease prevalence and mortality as hypertension and other risk factors
  go undetected and untreated'

description: Rapid urbanization in developing nations contributes to cardiovascular disease mortality
  through overwhelmed healthcare systems, lifestyle changes, and inadequate access to hypertension screening
  and treatment.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in Asia/Pacific region, now
    accounting for about one-third of all deaths. Risk appears higher among people in urban areas.

  description: Cultural influences on lifestyle decisions (salt and alcohol consumption, stress, smoking,
    body weight, exercise) affect hypertension risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces cardiovascular disease mortality to macro-level demographic
    and economic forces driving urbanization, rather than individual choices. The paper explicitly identifies
    structural factors including healthcare system capacity, medication access, and trained personnel
    availability as key determinants of health outcomes. Cultural factors are framed as contextual influences
    rather than individual blame.
