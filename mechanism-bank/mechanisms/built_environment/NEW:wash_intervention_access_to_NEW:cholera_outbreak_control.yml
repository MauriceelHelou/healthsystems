mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Humanitarian crises create conditions favorable for cholera transmission through displaced
  populations, contaminated water, and inadequate sanitation'
- 'Step 2: WaSH interventions target the environmental transmission pathway of Vibrio cholerae through
  water treatment and safe water provision'
- 'Step 3: Improved sanitation facilities prevent open defecation and fecal contamination of water sources'
- 'Step 4: Hygiene interventions including handwashing reduce person-to-person transmission'
- 'Step 5: Combined interventions interrupt the fecal-oral transmission cycle, controlling outbreak spread'

description: WaSH interventions are critical for controlling cholera outbreaks during humanitarian crises,
  which represent 43% of the crisis contexts studied. The interventions address the environmental determinants
  of cholera transmission by providing safe water and sanitation infrastructure to displaced and vulnerable
  populations.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Cholera outbreaks account for 43% of crisis contexts in the evidence base, suggesting
    geographic concentration of evidence in cholera-endemic or outbreak regions

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism is inherently structural, addressing the built environment and infrastructure
    failures that enable cholera transmission. Cholera outbreaks during humanitarian crises reflect systemic
    failures in public health infrastructure and are not attributable to individual behaviors. The evidence
    gap in geographic distribution suggests inequitable research attention across different crisis-affected
    populations, which may perpetuate disparities in evidence-based humanitarian response.
