- 'Step 1: Access to greenspace enables engagement in nature-based interventions (NBIs)
  including forest bathing, green exercise, gardening, and nature viewing'
- 'Step 2: NBIs reduce cardiovascular risk factors through multiple pathways: lowering
  blood pressure, reducing stress hormones, and decreasing biomarkers of CVD risk
  and inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Regular exposure to greenspace promotes increased physical activity and
  improved mental health outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative reduction in cardiovascular risk factors leads to decreased
  cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality'

description: 'This systematic review of 26 experimental studies found that nature-based
  interventions associated with greenspace access have beneficial effects on cardiovascular
  health outcomes. The review identified four main intervention categories: forest
  bathing, green exercise, gardening, and nature viewing. Measured outcomes included
  blood pressure reductions and improvements in biomarkers of CVD risk. The alluvial
  chart trends indicated consistent beneficial effects of NBIs on cardiovascular outcomes.
  The studies overall had low risk of bias according to modified Newcastle-Ottawa
  Scale assessment.'
