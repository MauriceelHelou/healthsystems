direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural areas have limited public transportation infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Individuals on community supervision in rural areas face high travel costs and time to reach
  SUD treatment facilities'
- 'Step 3: Transportation barriers reduce ability to attend scheduled treatment appointments'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment engagement leads to lower treatment entry and adherence rates'

description: Rural transportation barriers create structural impediments to SUD treatment access for justice-involved
  individuals, with costly travel being a significant factor in treatment engagement challenges that telehealth
  helped address.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 25
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Transportation barriers were identified as a rural-specific theme, with clinicians
    noting that removal of these barriers through telehealth was a key positive lesson learned from COVID-19
    transitions.

  description: Individuals on probation/parole may have additional constraints on transportation access
    and mobility that compound rural transportation barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism locates the source of treatment non-engagement in structural geographic
    and infrastructure factors rather than individual motivation or compliance. The emphasis on 'costly
    travel for rural clients' highlights economic barriers intersecting with geographic isolation. Kentucky's
    rural Appalachian context represents an area with historically underfunded transportation and healthcare
    infrastructure.
