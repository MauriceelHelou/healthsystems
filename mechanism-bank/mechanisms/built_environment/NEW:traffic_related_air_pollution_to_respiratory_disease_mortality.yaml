category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traffic sources (vehicles, roadways) emit particulate matter including
  PM2.5 containing combustion byproducts, metals, and organic compounds'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 particles are inhaled deep into the respiratory tract due to their
  small size (≤2.5 μm), penetrating bronchioles and alveoli'
- 'Step 3: Particles trigger inflammatory responses in airway epithelium, causing
  oxidative stress and immune activation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation leads to airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion,
  and epithelial damage'
- 'Step 5: These processes manifest as increased risk of cough, wheezing, lower respiratory
  illness, and other respiratory tract diseases'

description: Traffic-related air pollution, particularly PM2.5, significantly increases
  the risk of respiratory tract diseases. This meta-analysis of 35 cohort studies
  found that traffic-related pollution poses greater respiratory health risks than
  non-traffic-related air pollution. Children are particularly vulnerable, showing
  significant increases in wheezing, cough, and lower respiratory illness with PM2.5
  exposure.
