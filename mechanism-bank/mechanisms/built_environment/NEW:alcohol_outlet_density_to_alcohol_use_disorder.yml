direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets increases physical availability and accessibility of alcohol
  in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Increased competition among retailers creates a competitive local market that reduces product
  costs'
- 'Step 3: Greater visibility of alcohol products raises awareness of alcohol brands and normalizes consumption'
- 'Step 4: Local social norms shift to favor alcohol consumption when outlets are ubiquitous'
- 'Step 5: Increased alcohol consumption leads to higher rates of alcohol use disorder'

description: Higher density of alcohol outlets per 10,000 population is associated with increased alcohol
  availability, which contributes to alcohol-related harm through multiple pathways including increased
  supply, lower prices through competition, enhanced brand awareness, and normalization of consumption.

  description: Most deprived quintile of neighbourhoods had highest density of off-sales alcohol outlets;
    least deprived had lowest density
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly traces alcohol-related health inequities to structural
    factors - the spatial distribution of retail outlets - rather than individual choice. The paper demonstrates
    that deprived communities face disproportionate exposure to alcohol retail environments, creating
    a structural pathway to health inequity. Policy implications focus on supply-side interventions rather
    than individual behavior change.
