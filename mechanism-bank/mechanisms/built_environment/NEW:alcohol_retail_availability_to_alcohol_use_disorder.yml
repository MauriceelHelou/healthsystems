direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density and availability of alcohol retail outlets increases physical access to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Increased access reduces barriers to purchase including travel time and effort'
- 'Step 3: Greater availability normalizes alcohol consumption in community settings'
- 'Step 4: Increased consumption patterns elevate risk for alcohol use disorder development'

description: This mechanism represents the theoretical pathway from reduced alcohol availability to potential
  reductions in alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder. The study explicitly calls for future research
  to examine changes in consumption following the ban, indicating this pathway as the intended public
  health benefit.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The study notes alcohol use is a major public health problem in Uganda specifically;
    relationship between availability and consumption may vary by cultural and economic context

  description: Sachet alcohol products, due to affordability and accessibility, may have stronger availability-consumption
    relationships among lower-income populations
- name: premise_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Off-premise availability showed greater sensitivity to policy intervention, suggesting
    different consumption patterns by retail setting
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately targets the structural commercial environment rather
    than individual drinking behavior. By reducing physical availability through policy, the intervention
    modifies the choice architecture that shapes population-level consumption patterns. This approach
    recognizes that individual behavior occurs within structural constraints and opportunities shaped
    by commercial and regulatory environments.
