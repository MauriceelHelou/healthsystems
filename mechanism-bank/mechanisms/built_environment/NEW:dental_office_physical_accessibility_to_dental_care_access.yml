direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dental offices are designed without consideration for mobility aids, wheelchairs, or physical
  accommodations'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers include inaccessible entrances, narrow doorways, non-adjustable dental
  chairs'
- 'Step 3: People with physical disabilities cannot physically access or be positioned for dental treatment'
- 'Step 4: Patients must forgo dental care or travel long distances to find accessible facilities'
- 'Step 5: Oral health deteriorates due to inability to receive routine and emergency dental services'

description: The review identified structural problems of access to dental offices as a key barrier for
  people with disabilities. Physical infrastructure that fails to accommodate wheelchairs, mobility aids,
  and positioning needs prevents access to dental care.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This is a clear structural determinant rooted in built environment decisions, building
    codes, and enforcement of accessibility laws. The barrier exists independent of individual behaviors
    and reflects systemic failures to design inclusive healthcare spaces. Policy interventions include
    strengthening accessibility requirements for healthcare facilities and providing retrofitting support.
