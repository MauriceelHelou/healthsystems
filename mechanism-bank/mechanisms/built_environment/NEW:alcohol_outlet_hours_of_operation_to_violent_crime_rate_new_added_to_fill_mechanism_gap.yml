direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended hours of alcohol sales (20 hours/day) increase the temporal window during which patrons
  can purchase and consume alcohol at bars/taverns'
- 'Step 2: Late-night alcohol availability leads to increased intoxication among patrons during high-risk
  nighttime hours (8 PM to 4 AM)'
- 'Step 3: Intoxicated individuals congregating around alcohol outlets during late-night hours increases
  interpersonal conflicts and reduces inhibition'
- 'Step 4: The geographic concentration of intoxicated individuals near bars/taverns creates hotspots
  for violent encounters including assault, robbery, and homicide'
- 'Step 5: Reducing hours of sale (from 20 to 13 hours/day) decreases the density of violent crime incidents
  within proximity (800 ft) of alcohol outlets'

description: Maryland Senate Bill 571 reduced bar/tavern selling hours from 20 to 13 hours per day (6
  AM-2 AM changed to 9 AM-10 PM) in one Baltimore neighborhood. Compared to control neighborhoods, the
  treatment area showed a 23% per year reduction in violent crime density (annualized IRR 0.77) within
  800 feet of bars/taverns during nighttime hours (8 PM-4 AM). Similar reductions were observed for homicides
  and assaults specifically. The effect was sustained over time (slope change) rather than immediate (level
  change).

  variation_notes: Effect was specific to the treatment neighborhood in Baltimore subject to SB571; control
    neighborhoods with similar baseline characteristics did not show the same reduction. Geographic specificity
    was within 800-ft buffer around bars/taverns.
moderators:
- name: baseline_crime_rate
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Treatment and control areas were matched on mean baseline crime rate, suggesting the policy
    effect may be most detectable in areas with similar baseline violent crime levels
- name: alcohol_outlet_density
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Areas with higher alcohol outlet density may show greater effects from hours-of-sale restrictions
    due to concentration of exposure
- name: neighborhood_disadvantage
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Study matched on neighborhood disadvantage score; effects may differ in neighborhoods with
    varying levels of socioeconomic disadvantage
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention by targeting the built environment
    and regulatory policy rather than individual behavior. The policy reduces opportunities for alcohol-related
    violence by restricting commercial hours of operation rather than attempting to change individual
    drinking behavior. This approach acknowledges that violent crime near alcohol outlets is a predictable
    consequence of the physical and temporal availability of alcohol, not merely individual moral failing.
    The findings have equity implications as alcohol outlets are often concentrated in disadvantaged neighborhoods,
    meaning policies restricting hours of sale could disproportionately benefit communities most burdened
    by violence.
