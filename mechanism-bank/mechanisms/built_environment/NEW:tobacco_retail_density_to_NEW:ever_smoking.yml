direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High tobacco retail density creates ubiquitous exposure to tobacco products and marketing across
  neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure normalizes tobacco use and reduces perceived risks of experimentation'
- 'Step 3: Easy accessibility facilitates initial trial when curiosity or social pressure arises'
- 'Step 4: Even brief experimentation registers as lifetime exposure (ever smoking), serving as gateway
  to regular use'

description: Tobacco retail density is positively associated with ever smoking, indicating that retail
  environment influences smoking initiation. The high heterogeneity suggests this relationship may vary
  by context.

  variation_notes: High heterogeneity (I²=87.3%) suggests geographic and contextual variation in how retail
    density affects smoking initiation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Ever smoking captures lifetime initiation, reflecting how environmental exposure
    during formative periods shapes long-term health trajectories. This structural determinant operates
    through the commercial environment rather than individual susceptibility, identifying a modifiable
    policy target.
