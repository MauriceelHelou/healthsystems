description: |
  Poor housing quality (dampness, mold, inadequate ventilation, pest infestation)
  increases indoor air pollutants and allergens, leading to higher rates of
  asthma, COPD, and respiratory infections. The mechanism operates through:
  1. Structural defects → moisture intrusion → mold growth
  2. Poor ventilation → accumulation of indoor pollutants
  3. Pest infestation → allergen exposure
  4. Respiratory sensitization and inflammation

assumptions:
  - Housing quality can be measured through validated indices
  - Indoor air quality mediates the relationship
  - Effects are approximately linear within observed range
  - Applies to both children and adults, though effect sizes may differ

limitations:
  - Effect sizes vary by climate and geography
  - Self-reported housing quality may introduce bias
  - Confounding by socioeconomic status difficult to fully control
  - Long-term vs. short-term exposure effects may differ
