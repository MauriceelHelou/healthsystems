direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol outlet density creates greater spatial access to alcohol in the community'
- 'Step 2: According to routine activity theory, alcohol outlets serve as locations where motivated offenders
  and suitable targets converge'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol consumption at or near outlets reduces inhibitions and impairs judgment, increasing
  likelihood of violent interactions'
- 'Step 4: Areas with high outlet density experience elevated violent crime exposure due to these convergence
  and consumption effects'

description: Each 10% increase in alcohol outlet access was associated with a 4.2% increase in violent
  crime exposure. The study used spatial access methods and routine activity theory to examine the relationship
  between alcohol outlets and violent crime in Baltimore, MD.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces violent crime to structural factors (built environment, commercial
    land use policy) rather than individual behavior. The distribution of alcohol outlets is determined
    by zoning, licensing policy, and economic factors that disproportionately concentrate outlets in lower-income
    neighborhoods, creating inequitable exposure to crime risk. Policy interventions targeting outlet
    density and licensing could reduce violence without criminalizing individuals.
