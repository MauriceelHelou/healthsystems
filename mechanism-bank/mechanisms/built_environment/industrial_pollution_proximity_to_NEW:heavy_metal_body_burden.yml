mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industrial facilities release heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Hg) into air, water, and soil'
- 'Step 2: Residential proximity to industrial sites increases environmental exposure pathways'
- 'Step 3: Heavy metals enter the body through inhalation, contaminated water, and food grown in polluted
  soil'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated body burden of heavy metals increases risk of ototoxic effects'

description: This mechanism links the structural factor of industrial pollution proximity to heavy metal
  body burden, which subsequently leads to hearing impairment. The population-based meta-analysis examines
  environmental heavy metal exposure as a determinant of hearing loss.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Heavy metal exposure varies substantially by proximity to industrial facilities, which
    are disproportionately located near low-income communities and communities of color

  description: Lower SES communities have higher exposure due to environmental injustice in facility siting
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Industrial pollution proximity is a key environmental justice issue. Zoning decisions,
    lack of regulatory enforcement, and historical discriminatory practices have concentrated polluting
    facilities in marginalized communities. This structural arrangement produces differential exposure
    to ototoxic heavy metals, creating health inequities in hearing loss that trace to policy and planning
    failures rather than individual choices.
