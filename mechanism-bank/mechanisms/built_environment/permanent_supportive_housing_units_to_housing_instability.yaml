- 'Step 1: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) provides stable, long-term housing placements
  without preconditions such as sobriety or treatment compliance (Housing First approach)'
- 'Step 2: PSH combines affordable housing with wraparound supportive services including
  case management, mental health services, and substance use treatment tailored to
  individual needs'
- 'Step 3: The combination of secure housing tenure and integrated support services
  reduces barriers to housing retention and addresses underlying vulnerabilities that
  contribute to housing instability'
- 'Step 4: Residents experience reduced episodes of homelessness and increased number
  of stably housed days compared to usual care or no intervention'

description: Permanent supportive housing (PSH) significantly improves housing stability
  for people experiencing homelessness compared to usual care. This comprehensive
  systematic review of 86 studies found consistent evidence that PSH reduces housing
  instability across diverse populations, including those with high and moderate needs,
  comorbid mental illness, and substance-use disorders. PSH may also reduce emergency
  department visits and hospitalization days, though effects on mental health, substance
  use, and quality of life outcomes were mixed.
