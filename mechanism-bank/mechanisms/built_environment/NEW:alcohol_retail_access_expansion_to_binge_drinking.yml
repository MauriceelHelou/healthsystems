direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Privatization increases the number and types of retail outlets selling liquor'
- 'Step 2: Greater physical availability reduces travel time and effort to obtain alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Expanded hours of sale at private retailers increase temporal access'
- 'Step 4: Increased household liquor stockpiling facilitates higher consumption occasions'
- 'Step 5: Population-level increases in liquor purchasing may translate to increased binge drinking episodes'

description: The study demonstrates that increased alcohol retail access through privatization leads to
  substantial increases in household alcohol purchases (82% increase in liquor, 26% increase in total
  ethanol), which represents a proximate pathway to potential increases in harmful drinking patterns including
  binge drinking

  description: Low and moderate purchasers showed increased ethanol consumption while high purchasers
    decreased, suggesting access expansion may differentially affect population subgroups
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism connects the built environment (alcohol retail density and access)
    to health-relevant behaviors without placing blame on individuals. The policy choice to privatize
    creates population-level exposure changes. The finding that low/moderate purchasers increased while
    high purchasers decreased suggests complex equity implications - expanding access may recruit new
    or occasional drinkers while potentially not increasing consumption among already heavy users
