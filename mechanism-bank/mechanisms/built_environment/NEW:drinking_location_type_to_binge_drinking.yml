mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensed premises (bars, pubs, clubs) create physical environments designed to promote alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 2: Social norms within these venues encourage continued drinking and larger quantities'
- 'Step 3: Availability of alcohol is immediate and continuous in licensed settings'
- 'Step 4: Lack of home-based constraints (cost, limited supply) enables heavier consumption per occasion'

description: Physical drinking location (licensed premises vs. private settings) is an important driver
  of whether an individual engages in heavy drinking occasions. The built environment characteristics
  of drinking venues shape consumption patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes how built environment and commercial alcohol availability
    create contexts for heavy drinking rather than individual choice. Alcohol outlet licensing policies
    and zoning represent upstream structural interventions. The finding that context effects vary by demographics
    highlights how structural factors produce differential vulnerability.
