direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural housing defects (leaks, poor ventilation) create moisture accumulation'
- 'Step 2: Persistent moisture enables mold growth in indoor environments'
- 'Step 3: Mold releases spores and mycotoxins into indoor air'
- 'Step 4: Inhalation of mold spores triggers allergic and inflammatory respiratory responses'
- 'Step 5: Sustained exposure leads to increased frequency of respiratory symptoms'

description: Mold growth in housing creates a direct biological pathway to respiratory symptoms through
  airborne exposure to allergenic and toxic compounds that trigger inflammatory responses in children's
  airways.

    problems
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Mold presence reflects structural housing maintenance failures and building code
    enforcement gaps. Low-income families lack resources for mold remediation and legal power to compel
    landlord repairs, creating systematic exposure inequities based on class and race.
