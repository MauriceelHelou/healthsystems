direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Relaxed ethanol quality standards allow technical-grade or denatured alcohol sources into hand
  sanitizer production'
- 'Step 2: Some products may contain methanol or other toxic alcohols as contaminants or substitutes'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate labeling fails to warn consumers about product contents or risks'
- 'Step 4: Consumers may be exposed to toxic alcohols through dermal absorption or accidental/intentional
  ingestion'
- 'Step 5: Vulnerable populations including children and individuals with alcohol use disorder face elevated
  risks'

description: Substandard alcohol-based hand rubs entering the market due to relaxed regulations may contain
  methanol or other toxic alcohols, creating exposure risks particularly for vulnerable populations who
  may ingest these products accidentally or intentionally.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism traces exposure risk to regulatory policy decisions rather than individual
    behavior. While ingestion of hand sanitizer may appear to be an individual choice, structural factors
    including product availability, labeling standards, packaging design, and access to safer alternatives
    determine population-level risk. Equity implications include disproportionate risk for individuals
    with alcohol use disorder who may consume these products, children in unsupervised settings, and communities
    with limited access to recall information.
