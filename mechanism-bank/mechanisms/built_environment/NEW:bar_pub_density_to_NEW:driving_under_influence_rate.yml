category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher bar/pub density increases geographic concentration of alcohol consumption venues'
- 'Step 2: Patrons consume alcohol at on-premise establishments during weekend evening hours'
- 'Step 3: Limited transportation alternatives in many neighborhoods necessitate driving'
- 'Step 4: Intoxicated patrons leave establishments and operate motor vehicles'
- 'Step 5: DUI incidents increase in Census block groups with greater bar/pub concentrations'

description: Areas with greater densities of bars/pubs experience more driving under the influence incidents,
  particularly during weekend evening hours. The temporal pattern aligns with peak alcohol sales periods
  at these establishments.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the built environment configuration of alcohol outlets,
    combined with transportation infrastructure limitations, creates structural conditions for impaired
    driving. Solutions should focus on outlet regulation, transportation alternatives, and neighborhood
    planning rather than solely individual deterrence. Areas with fewer transportation options may face
    greater DUI burden, creating equity concerns.
