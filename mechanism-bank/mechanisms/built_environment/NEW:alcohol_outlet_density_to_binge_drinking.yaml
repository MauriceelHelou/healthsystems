  node_name: Alcohol Consumption
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density increases physical availability and convenience
  of purchasing alcohol in a geographic area'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability reduces barriers to alcohol acquisition including
  travel time and effort, making impulsive and excessive purchasing easier'
- 'Step 3: Greater outlet density often leads to competitive pricing and promotional
  activities, further incentivizing consumption'
- 'Step 4: Normalized presence of alcohol outlets in the environment creates social
  cues that reinforce drinking behavior'
- 'Step 5: Reduced constraints on availability facilitate binge drinking patterns,
  particularly during evening and late-night hours'

description: Higher density of alcohol outlets in a community increases the availability
  and accessibility of alcohol, which facilitates higher rates of alcohol consumption
  including binge drinking. The CHALICE study protocol examines this relationship
  using a natural experiment design in Wales, measuring changes in outlet density
  against consumption patterns from Welsh Health Surveys. The study uses network analysis
  methods to estimate outlet density exposure at individual and small-area levels.
