direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High alcohol availability increases opportunities for alcohol access and
  purchase'
- 'Step 2: Increased access leads to higher rates of alcohol consumption at individual
  and population levels'
- 'Step 3: Greater consumption increases risk exposure for acute harms (injuries,
  violence) and chronic conditions (liver disease, cancer)'
- 'Step 4: Population-level increases in consumption translate to elevated rates of
  alcohol-related morbidity and mortality'
