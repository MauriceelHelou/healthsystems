direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Air pollutants deposit in lower respiratory tract and alveoli'
- 'Step 2: Pollutants cause direct cytotoxic damage to respiratory epithelium'
- 'Step 3: Damaged epithelial barrier allows easier pathogen entry and colonization'
- 'Step 4: Impaired mucociliary clearance reduces ability to clear pathogens'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections'

description: Air pollution directly increases lower respiratory tract infections in children by damaging
  protective epithelial barriers and impairing natural clearance mechanisms in the lungs.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Risk magnitude varies significantly between developing and developed countries, with
    much higher risk in developing regions
moderators:
- name: country_development_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Children in developing countries face much higher magnitude of risk due to higher pollution
    levels and co-occurring risk factors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects global inequities in environmental protection and industrial
    development. Children in developing countries bear disproportionate disease burden due to weaker environmental
    regulations, industrial pollution from global supply chains, and lack of access to clean energy. The
    geographic variation represents structural violence embedded in global economic systems.
