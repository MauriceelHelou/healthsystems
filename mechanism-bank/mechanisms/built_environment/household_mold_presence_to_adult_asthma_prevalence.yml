mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate housing construction, ventilation, or maintenance creates moisture accumulation'
- 'Step 2: Moisture promotes mold growth and spore release in indoor air'
- 'Step 3: Mold spores act as allergens and respiratory irritants when inhaled'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure triggers inflammatory responses in airways'
- 'Step 5: Persistent airway inflammation manifests as asthma symptoms and diagnosis'

description: Mold presence in homes significantly increases adult asthma risk through direct respiratory
  irritation and allergenic responses. The study found mold exposure associated with increased asthma
  odds.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural housing inequities - mold growth typically results
    from inadequate building codes, poor construction quality, insufficient maintenance resources, or
    landlord neglect rather than individual choices. Low-income households disproportionately experience
    housing quality problems due to limited housing options and weak tenant protections. Housing policy
    failures create differential exposure to respiratory hazards.
