  node_name: Alcohol-Induced Mortality
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density increases physical availability of alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Competitive retail environment drives down prices, making alcohol more affordable'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure to alcohol marketing and brands normalizes heavy consumption'
- 'Step 4: Higher population-level alcohol consumption leads to increased alcohol-related disease'
- 'Step 5: Chronic alcohol-related conditions contribute to alcohol-induced mortality'

description: The concentration of alcohol outlets in deprived neighbourhoods contributes to the social
  gradient in alcohol-related mortality by creating differential exposure to alcohol availability based
  on socioeconomic status of the area.
quantitative_effects:
  p_value: 0.001
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Positive linear relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and off-sales alcohol
    outlet density across Scotland; spatial patterning creates differential exposure by socioeconomic
    status

- name: neighbourhood_income_deprivation
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Off-sales alcohol outlet density shows strong positive linear relationship with neighbourhood
    deprivation (p<0.001)
- name: outlet_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Off-sales outlets show stronger deprivation gradient than on-sales; least deprived had
    lowest density of both types
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how the built environment creates health inequities
    through spatial patterning of harmful commodity retail. The social gradient in alcohol outlet density
    mirrors and likely contributes to the social gradient in alcohol-related disease, representing a structural
    determinant that operates at the community rather than individual level.
