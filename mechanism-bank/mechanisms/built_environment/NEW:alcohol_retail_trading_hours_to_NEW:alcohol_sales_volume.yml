mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended trading hours increase temporal availability of alcohol at retail outlets'
- 'Step 2: Increased temporal availability provides more opportunities for purchase'
- 'Step 3: Greater purchasing opportunities could theoretically increase total alcohol sales volume'
- 'Step 4: In this study, a 1-hour extension on Saturdays did not produce statistically significant changes
  in sales'

description: 'This stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial tested whether extending off-premises
  alcohol trading hours by 1 hour on Saturdays affected alcohol sales at Norwegian state monopoly outlets.
  The study found no statistically significant effect on monthly alcohol sales per trade district (average
  treatment effect: -185.5 litres, 95% CI = -1159.9, 788.9) or per outlet (-35.3 litres, 95% CI = -142.1,
  72.0). Results were consistent across estimation methods and model specifications.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This study examines a structural-level alcohol policy intervention (trading hours
    regulation) rather than individual behavior. The Norwegian alcohol monopoly system (Vinmonopolet)
    represents a population-level structural approach to alcohol control. The null findings suggest that
    small marginal changes to already restricted trading hours may not significantly impact purchasing
    patterns in a context of strong baseline alcohol control policies. This has implications for understanding
    the threshold effects of structural alcohol policies and suggests that incremental deregulation may
    not immediately increase consumption. The study design (RCT at policy level) represents strong causal
    evidence for structural determinants.
