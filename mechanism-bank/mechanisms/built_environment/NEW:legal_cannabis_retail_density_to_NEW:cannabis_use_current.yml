mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legalization enables establishment of licensed cannabis retail outlets in communities'
- 'Step 2: Higher density of retail outlets increases geographic proximity and convenience of access'
- 'Step 3: Reduced travel distance and time barriers lower transaction costs for obtaining cannabis'
- 'Step 4: Increased visibility and normalization of cannabis retail presence may reduce perceived risk'
- 'Step 5: Combined accessibility and normalization leads to increased cannabis consumption rates'

description: Systematic review of 13 studies (n=333,550 participants) found that increased availability
  of legal cannabis, measured by proximity or density of retail outlets, is consistently linked to increased
  current cannabis use in both adults and adolescents.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 333550
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: All studies were conducted in North America, with the majority from Western US states.
    Geographic variation in regulatory frameworks and baseline cannabis exposure likely influences effects.

  description: Groups who have been least exposed to cannabis before legalization are most susceptible
    to increased availability - the positive correlation is most pronounced among those less exposed before
    legalization

  description: Effects observed in both adults and adolescents, suggesting availability impacts multiple
    age groups
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how commercial environment and regulatory policy shape
    substance use patterns at the population level. The finding that previously less-exposed groups are
    most affected by increased availability suggests structural vulnerability - those without prior access
    networks become newly exposed through commercial infrastructure. Policy implications point to restricting
    retail density, especially in densely populated areas, as a structural intervention rather than individual
    behavior change.
