direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographic areas with poor environmental conditions expose children to
  higher levels of air pollution, allergens, and respiratory irritants'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure to environmental triggers causes airway inflammation,
  increased asthma symptom severity, and more frequent asthma exacerbations in pediatric
  populations'
- 'Step 3: Increased frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations leads to greater
  need for acute medical care, resulting in higher rates of emergency department visits
  and hospitalizations'

description: This systematic review of 40 US-based studies found consistent significant
  associations between environmental conditions and pediatric asthma healthcare utilization
  (ED visits and hospitalizations) when analyzed at the population level using geographic
  entities. Environmental conditions were among the most frequently studied social
  determinants of health and demonstrated reliable positive associations with acute
  asthma care utilization across multiple study designs and geographic scales.

  description: Limited healthcare and primary care access showed consistent associations
    with higher acute care utilization, suggesting lack of preventive care exacerbates
    environmental exposure impacts
