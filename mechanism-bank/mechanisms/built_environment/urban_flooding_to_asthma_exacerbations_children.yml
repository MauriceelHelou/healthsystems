mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban flooding creates moisture infiltration in housing structures'
- 'Step 2: Persistent moisture promotes mold and mildew growth in homes'
- 'Step 3: Mold spores and mycotoxins become airborne respiratory irritants'
- 'Step 4: Children with asthma experience allergic reactions and airway inflammation from mold exposure'
- 'Step 5: Increased frequency of asthma exacerbations following flood events'

description: Urban flooding creates indoor mold growth that triggers asthma exacerbations in children
  through respiratory allergen exposure.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects observed in specific flood-prone areas of South Side Chicago with inadequate
    drainage infrastructure
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural inequities in urban infrastructure investment.
    Low-income communities and communities of color often have inadequate stormwater management systems
    due to historical disinvestment. Flood vulnerability results from policy choices about infrastructure
    spending, not individual behaviors. Climate change compounds these structural inequities.
