mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing First programs provide rapid access to permanent housing without
  requiring sobriety or treatment compliance as preconditions'
- 'Step 2: Participants receive stable, non-abstinence-contingent housing along with
  supportive services tailored to their needs'
- 'Step 3: Housing stability is achieved as participants spend significantly more
  days housed compared to those receiving traditional services'
- 'Step 4: Sustained housing placement reduces the number of individuals experiencing
  homelessness at the population level'

description: Housing First interventions significantly reduce homelessness by providing
  immediate, unconditional access to permanent housing combined with supportive services.
  This systematic review of 4 RCTs found intervention participants were 2.46 times
  more likely to be housed at 18-24 months and spent substantially more days housed
  (SMD=1.24) compared to control groups receiving traditional services.
