mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Indoor tobacco smoke exposure occurs through smoking within home environments'
- 'Step 2: Poor ventilation in housing units allows smoke to accumulate and persist'
- 'Step 3: Tobacco smoke contains multiple respiratory irritants and carcinogens'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure triggers airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness'
- 'Step 5: Results in worsened asthma control and increased symptom frequency'

description: Second-hand tobacco smoke was identified as one of the most assessed indoor home environmental
  exposures affecting asthma patients.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Indoor tobacco smoke exposure reflects structural factors including housing density,
    ventilation quality, and smoking policy enforcement. Multi-unit housing with poor ventilation systems
    can expose non-smoking residents to neighbors' smoke. Tobacco use patterns also correlate with stress
    from economic hardship and limited cessation resources.
