direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hurricane/storm exposure causes direct physical damage to buildings, infrastructure,
  and the built environment through high winds, storm surge, and flooding'
- 'Step 2: Structural damage leads to building collapses, flying debris, and physical
  injuries causing immediate traumatic deaths'
- 'Step 3: Infrastructure destruction disrupts healthcare access, emergency services,
  power supply, and water/sanitation systems'
- 'Step 4: Displacement from damaged housing creates exposure to environmental hazards,
  inadequate shelter, and disrupted medication access'
- 'Step 5: Post-storm conditions including contaminated water, mold exposure, and
  compromised air quality contribute to delayed mortality from respiratory and infectious
  diseases'
- 'Step 6: Cumulative stress on vulnerable populations (elderly, those with chronic
  conditions) leads to excess mortality in weeks to months following exposure'

description: 'Hurricane and storm exposure significantly increases all-cause mortality
  through multiple built environment pathways. Meta-analysis of 71 studies found a
  statistically significant 9% increase in all-cause mortality (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.04-1.13)
  following cyclone exposure. The effect operates through direct trauma from structural
  damage, disruption of critical infrastructure including healthcare systems and utilities,
  and secondary health effects from damaged built environments including contaminated
  water and compromised housing. Evidence is strongest for high-intensity cyclones
  (Category 4-5) and shows consistent elevation in mortality risk across multiple
  geographic settings.'
