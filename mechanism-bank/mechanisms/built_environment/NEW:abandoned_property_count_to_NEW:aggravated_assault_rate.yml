- 'Step 1: Abandoned and vacant properties signal neighborhood disinvestment and reduced informal social
  control'
- 'Step 2: Physical disorder creates opportunities for criminal activity and reduces natural surveillance'
- 'Step 3: Abandoned properties may attract illicit activities including drug use and dealing'
- 'Step 4: Reduced collective efficacy and increased opportunity structures lead to higher rates of interpersonal
  violence'

description: Abandoned property count is positively associated with aggravated assault rates, with each
  additional abandoned property associated with a 28% increase in assault incidence. This reflects how
  physical disorder and neighborhood disinvestment create conditions conducive to violence.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Abandoned properties result from structural forces including redlining, deindustrialization,
    and housing market failures—not individual negligence. The concentration of abandonment in specific
    neighborhoods reflects racialized disinvestment. Addressing abandoned properties through housing policy
    represents a structural violence prevention strategy.
