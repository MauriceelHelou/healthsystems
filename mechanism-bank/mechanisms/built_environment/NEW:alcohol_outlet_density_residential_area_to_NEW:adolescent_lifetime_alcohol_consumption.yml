direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Residential proximity to alcohol outlets creates cumulative exposure during formative developmental
  years'
- 'Step 2: Environmental availability shapes social norms around alcohol use in the community'
- 'Step 3: Higher outlet density facilitates initial experimentation and onset of alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Family income levels (71% lived in families with income up to five minimum wages) may correlate
  with neighborhood outlet density patterns'

description: The study found a lifetime alcohol consumption prevalence of 57% among adolescents aged 14-17
  years. While the association between outlet density and lifetime consumption was explored, the significant
  findings were specific to current consumption. The high lifetime prevalence reflects the broader environmental
  context of alcohol availability.

  description: 71% of adolescents lived in families with income up to five minimum wages; analysis adjusted
    for family factors suggesting socioeconomic context matters
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The high prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption (57%) among this urban Brazilian
    adolescent population reflects structural factors including alcohol outlet distribution, economic
    contexts (majority low-income families), and regulatory environments. The study's adjustment for individual
    and family factors isolates the independent contribution of neighborhood-level alcohol availability,
    emphasizing the structural nature of this determinant.
