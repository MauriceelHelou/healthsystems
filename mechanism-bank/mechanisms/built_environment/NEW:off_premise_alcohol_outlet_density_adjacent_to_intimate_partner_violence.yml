direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-premise alcohol outlets in surrounding/adjacent block groups increase regional alcohol
  availability'
- 'Step 2: Spatial spillover effects allow residents to access alcohol from nearby areas even if local
  density is low'
- 'Step 3: Increased regional alcohol availability contributes to household alcohol consumption across
  neighborhood boundaries'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related domestic violence risk diffuses across spatial units'
- 'Step 5: Male-on-female domestic violence in focal neighborhoods is influenced by alcohol outlet density
  in surrounding areas'

description: A novel contribution of this study is demonstrating that off-premise alcohol outlet density
  in surrounding/adjacent block groups significantly predicts male-on-female domestic violence in focal
  neighborhoods. This spatial spillover effect indicates that alcohol availability operates across neighborhood
  boundaries to influence domestic violence risk.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 571
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Key finding of this study is the spatial spillover effect - alcohol availability in
    surrounding block groups significantly predicts MFDV in focal block groups. This demonstrates that
    domestic violence risk transcends immediate neighborhood boundaries.

  description: The study controlled for MFDV lag (spatial autocorrelation in violence), suggesting violence
    patterns in adjacent areas also matter
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This finding has important policy implications: interventions targeting only individual
    neighborhoods may be insufficient if surrounding areas maintain high alcohol availability. Regional
    approaches to alcohol outlet regulation may be necessary. This mechanism emphasizes structural/spatial
    determinants over individual-level explanations, recognizing that environmental exposures do not respect
    administrative boundaries.'
