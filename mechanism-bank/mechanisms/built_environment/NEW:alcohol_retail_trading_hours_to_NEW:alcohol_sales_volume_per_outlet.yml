direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended operating hours at individual retail outlets increase available shopping time'
- 'Step 2: Additional hour allows consumers who could not shop during previous hours to make purchases'
- 'Step 3: Per-outlet sales could increase if new purchasing occasions are created rather than shifted'
- 'Step 4: In this study, the 1-hour extension showed no significant effect on per-outlet sales'

description: Analysis at the outlet level found no statistically significant effect of the 1-hour Saturday
  trading extension on monthly alcohol sales (-35.3 litres pure alcohol, 95% CI = -142.1, 72.0). The study
  used 229 eligible state monopoly outlets clustered into 62 trade districts with staggered implementation
  across three time points.

  description: Norway's state alcohol monopoly system limits overall alcohol availability compared to
    private retail systems, potentially attenuating effects of marginal hour changes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The outlet-level analysis demonstrates how structural alcohol control policies
    (state monopoly, limited hours) operate through retail infrastructure. The null finding at outlet
    level suggests that temporal access restrictions within an already controlled environment may have
    reached a threshold where marginal relaxation does not change purchasing behavior. This highlights
    the importance of understanding policy contexts when evaluating structural interventions.
