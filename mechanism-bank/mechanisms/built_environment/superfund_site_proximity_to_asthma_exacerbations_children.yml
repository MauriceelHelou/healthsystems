category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Superfund sites release toxic pollutants into surrounding air, soil, and water'
- 'Step 2: Children living nearby experience chronic exposure to airborne toxins and particulates'
- 'Step 3: Toxic exposures cause respiratory tract irritation and systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Compromised respiratory function increases asthma symptom severity'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of asthma exacerbations in children near pollution sources'

description: Living near Superfund pollution sites exposes children to environmental toxins that exacerbate
  asthma through respiratory irritation and inflammation.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects observed in specific South Side Chicago neighborhoods with proximity to industrial
    pollution sources
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects environmental racism - the systematic placement of toxic
    facilities in communities of color and low-income areas. Superfund site locations result from decades
    of discriminatory zoning and environmental policy that treated Black and Latino neighborhoods as sacrifice
    zones. Children have no individual control over toxic exposure from industrial pollution.
