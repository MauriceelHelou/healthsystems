direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Air pollutants trigger oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades in developing airways'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation causes airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure sensitizes immune system to environmental triggers'
- 'Step 4: Airway structural changes become permanent, creating asthmatic phenotype'
- 'Step 5: Clinical asthma symptoms and diagnosis emerge'

description: Air pollution exposure triggers chronic inflammatory processes in children's developing airways,
  leading to permanent structural changes that manifest as clinical asthma.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Geographic variation depends on pollution source types, concentrations, and exposure
    duration patterns across different regions
moderators:
- name: child_physiological_susceptibility
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Children are particularly susceptible due to developing respiratory systems and higher
    breathing rates relative to body size
- name: behavioral_exposure_patterns
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Children's behavioral patterns (outdoor play, mouth breathing) increase pollution exposure
    compared to adults
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how environmental racism and residential segregation
    concentrate pollution exposure among marginalized communities. Children's asthma rates reflect structural
    decisions about industrial siting, transportation infrastructure, and housing policy that determine
    who lives near pollution sources. The 'behavioral factors' mentioned reflect children's normal developmental
    needs, not individual choices.
