description: Meta-analysis of 10 studies examining road traffic noise and diabetes incidence demonstrates
  a 7% increased risk per 10 dB increase in noise exposure. This effect size is consistent with the mortality
  findings, supporting a causal pathway from noise to diabetes development.

  equity_implications: The consistency between incidence and mortality associations strengthens the evidence
    for a causal relationship and supports policy action to reduce transportation noise exposure, particularly
    in communities with high chronic disease burden.
