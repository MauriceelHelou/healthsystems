mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended hours of alcohol sales increase the duration of alcohol availability at on-premises
  establishments'
- 'Step 2: Longer availability allows for extended drinking sessions resulting in higher levels of intoxication'
- 'Step 3: Intoxication reduces impulse control and increases aggressive responses to perceived provocations'
- 'Step 4: Concentration of intoxicated patrons exiting bars during late hours creates flashpoints for
  interpersonal aggression'
- 'Step 5: Policy restricting hours reduces assault incidents by limiting the window of elevated risk'

description: Assaults (including aggravated and common assault) showed similar reductions to all violent
  crime following the policy intervention. The study specifically measured crimes during nighttime hours
  (8 PM-4 AM) when alcohol-related violence is most likely to occur. The restriction of bar/tavern hours
  from closing at 2 AM to closing at 10 PM removed 4 hours of peak risk time.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism demonstrates that assault rates are responsive to structural environmental
    changes in alcohol policy. This framing shifts responsibility from individual 'violent offenders'
    to modifiable environmental conditions that create contexts for violence. Equity implications include
    the potential for such policies to reduce assault-related injury and trauma in communities with high
    bar/tavern concentration.
