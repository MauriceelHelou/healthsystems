- 'Step 1: Higher economic status neighborhoods have greater commercial activity and entertainment districts'
- 'Step 2: Bars locate in areas with higher disposable income and nightlife demand'
- 'Step 3: Zoning in affluent areas may permit more bars as part of commercial development'
- 'Step 4: Results in higher bar density in economically advantaged neighborhoods'

description: Bar density is higher in neighborhoods with higher economic status, contrasting with off-premise
  outlets which concentrate in lower economic status areas. This reveals differential patterns of alcohol
  availability by outlet type across the socioeconomic gradient.

  variation_notes: This pattern was observed in Valencia, Spain. The relationship between economic status
    and bar density may differ in other urban contexts.

  description: Bar density was also associated with higher spatially-lagged economic status, suggesting

  equity_implications: The differential distribution of bars (higher status areas) versus off-premise
    outlets (lower status areas) reflects how economic geography shapes alcohol environments. While both
    increase alcohol availability, they may have different implications for neighborhood safety and health.
    Zoning and economic factors create distinct alcohol landscapes across neighborhood types.
