category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of retail alcohol outlets within residential neighborhoods increases physical
  accessibility to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Increased accessibility facilitates higher frequency and volume of alcohol consumption among
  residents'
- 'Step 3: Chronic heavy alcohol use leads to physiological dependence and neuroadaptation'
- 'Step 4: When alcohol consumption is reduced or ceased, dependent individuals experience alcohol withdrawal
  syndrome requiring hospitalization'

description: Higher density of alcohol retail outlets, particularly off-sale outlets within one-quarter
  mile of residence, is associated with increased risk of hospital admission for alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
  This structural environmental factor shapes alcohol-related health outcomes through increased accessibility.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately identifies the built environment (alcohol outlet density)
    as a structural determinant rather than blaming individual drinking behavior. The concentration of
    alcohol outlets in neighborhoods represents a policy-modifiable factor that differentially affects
    communities. Zoning and licensing policies create unequal exposure to alcohol availability, often
    concentrated in lower-income and minority neighborhoods, perpetuating health inequities. Regulatory
    interventions targeting outlet density represent structural solutions.
