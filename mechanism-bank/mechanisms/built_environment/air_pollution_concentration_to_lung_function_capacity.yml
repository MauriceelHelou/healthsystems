mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Air pollutants cause direct toxic damage to developing lung tissue'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation disrupts normal alveolar development and growth'
- 'Step 3: Impaired lung growth reduces maximum achievable lung capacity'
- 'Step 4: Structural lung damage becomes permanent during critical developmental windows'
- 'Step 5: Decreased lung function capacity persists into adulthood'

  of lung growth and capacity in children through direct toxic damage and inflammatory disruption of normal
  lung development.

  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how environmental injustice creates lifelong health disparities.
    Children's lung development reflects the quality of air in their neighborhoods, which is determined
    by zoning policies, industrial regulations, and residential segregation patterns. Reduced lung function
    represents a form of structural violence that permanently diminishes life opportunities.
