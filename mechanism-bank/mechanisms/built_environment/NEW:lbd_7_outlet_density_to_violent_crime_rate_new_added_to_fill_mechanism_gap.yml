mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: LBD-7 outlets hold combined licenses permitting both off-premise and on-premise alcohol sales'
- 'Step 2: These hybrid outlets combine the crime-generating features of both outlet types'
- 'Step 3: Customers may consume on-site or purchase for off-site consumption in unregulated settings'
- 'Step 4: The combined access increases opportunities for alcohol-facilitated violent crime similar to
  pure off-premise outlets'

description: A 10% increase in access to LBD-7 outlets (combined off- and on-premise license) was associated
  with a 4.2% increase in violent crime exposure, similar to pure off-premise outlets.

  variation_notes: LBD-7 is a Baltimore-specific license category; findings apply to similar combined
    license types in other jurisdictions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The similar effect size for LBD-7 and off-premise outlets suggests that licensing
    policies permitting off-site alcohol sales are the key structural driver. This supports policies that
    restrict combined licenses or require additional security measures for establishments selling alcohol
    for off-site consumption.
