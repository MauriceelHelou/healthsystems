description: Experimental studies in barroom settings have demonstrated that when alcohol prices decrease
  (such as during happy hour promotions), consumption increases, and when prices increase, consumption
  decreases. This provides causal evidence for the price-consumption relationship in real-world drinking
  environments.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how commercial practices and business pricing strategies
    in drinking establishments create structural incentives for increased alcohol consumption. Policies
    restricting happy hour promotions or drink specials represent structural interventions that can reduce
    binge drinking without requiring individual-level behavior change.
