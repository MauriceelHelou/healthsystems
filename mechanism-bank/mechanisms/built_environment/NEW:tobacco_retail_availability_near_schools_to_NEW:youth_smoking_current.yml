direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco retailers located near schools expose students to tobacco products during daily school
  commutes'
- 'Step 2: Point-of-sale advertising and product displays target youth during developmentally sensitive
  periods'
- 'Step 3: Proximity facilitates peer-influenced purchasing before or after school'
- 'Step 4: School-area tobacco retail creates environmental cues that prompt smoking among current youth
  smokers'

description: Mixed measures of tobacco retail availability near schools show a small but consistent positive
  association with current youth smoking (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05) with no heterogeneity, suggesting
  a reliable effect.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 1.03
    type: odds_ratio
    ci_lower: 1.01
    ci_upper: 1.05
  heterogeneity_i_squared: 0.0
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: School neighborhood zoning and retail policies vary geographically, creating differential
    youth exposure
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Schools represent a critical environment where policy can protect vulnerable youth.
    The small effect size reflects the importance of school-specific zoning policies as a targeted intervention.
    This mechanism supports tobacco-free school zone policies as structural rather than individual-level
    interventions.
