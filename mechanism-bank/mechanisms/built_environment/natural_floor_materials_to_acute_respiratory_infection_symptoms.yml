direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Natural floor materials (earth, sand, dung) create porous surfaces that retain moisture'
- 'Step 2: Moisture retention enables dust accumulation and microbial growth'
- 'Step 3: Increased particulate matter and bioaerosols become airborne through daily activities'
- 'Step 4: Children''s developing respiratory systems and ground-level activities increase exposure'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced respiratory irritation and infection susceptibility'

description: Natural flooring materials increase children's respiratory infection symptoms through enhanced
  household air pollution and particulate matter exposure, particularly affecting children who spend time
  at floor level.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects observed specifically in Punjab province, with children in western regions
    at higher risk

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Western regions of Punjab show higher ARI risk, potentially due to environmental or socioeconomic
    factors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural inequities in housing policy and construction
    standards. Natural floor materials indicate poverty and lack of access to quality building materials,
    which is determined by economic policies, rural development investments, and housing standards enforcement.
    Children bear disproportionate health burden from structural housing inadequacy.
