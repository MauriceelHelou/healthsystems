mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of bars/pubs in neighborhoods increases physical availability of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Weekend evening hours see peak alcohol consumption at these establishments'
- 'Step 3: Intoxication reduces inhibition and increases aggressive behavior among patrons'
- 'Step 4: Concentration of intoxicated individuals in geographic areas increases interpersonal conflict'
- 'Step 5: Assault incidents increase in Census block groups with greater bar/pub concentrations'

description: Areas with greater densities of bars/pubs experience more assault incidents, particularly
  during weekend evening hours when alcohol sales and consumption are greatest. The spatiotemporal signature
  suggests bars/pubs are a critical source of these crimes across neighbourhoods.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies alcohol outlet density as a structural environmental
    factor that shapes crime patterns at the neighborhood level. Rather than blaming individual behavior,
    it demonstrates how the built environment's configuration of alcohol retail creates conditions for
    violence. Policy implications focus on zoning, licensing, and outlet-specific interventions rather
    than individual responsibility. Equity implications exist as bar/pub density often varies by neighborhood
    socioeconomic status.
