mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Products with substandard packaging may be mistaken for beverages or other consumables'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate child-resistant packaging increases access by children'
- 'Step 3: Lack of warning labels reduces awareness of toxicity risks'
- 'Step 4: Accidental ingestion occurs more frequently with improperly packaged products'
- 'Step 5: Health Canada advisories and recalls occur after products are already in consumers'' homes'

description: Relaxed packaging standards for alcohol-based hand rubs during the pandemic allowed products
  that could be mistaken for beverages or were not child-resistant, increasing risks of unintentional
  poisoning particularly among children.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how regulatory infrastructure protects population health
    through packaging standards. The shift to reactive rather than proactive regulation during the pandemic
    created structural conditions for increased poisoning risk. The burden falls disproportionately on
    families with young children and those with limited resources to monitor product recalls.
