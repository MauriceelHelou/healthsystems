mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Indoor dampness creates ideal conditions for mold growth and dust mite proliferation'
- 'Step 2: Damp conditions promote release of mycotoxins and allergens into indoor air'
- 'Step 3: Inhalation of these biological irritants triggers inflammatory responses in airways'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure leads to persistent airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness'
- 'Step 5: Results in increased frequency and severity of asthma symptoms'

description: Indoor dampness was the exposure most associated with adverse asthma outcomes (79% of studies),
  representing the strongest identified mechanism linking housing conditions to respiratory health outcomes.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural housing inequities - dampness often results
    from poor building maintenance, inadequate ventilation systems, and substandard housing construction
    that disproportionately affects low-income residents. Housing quality is determined by policy decisions
    around building codes, landlord accountability, and housing assistance programs.
