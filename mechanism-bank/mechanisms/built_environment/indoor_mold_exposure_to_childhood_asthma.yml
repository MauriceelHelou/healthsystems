mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing conditions enable mold growth in indoor environments'
- 'Step 2: Children spend significant time in home environments with sustained mold exposure'
- 'Step 3: Developing respiratory systems are more vulnerable to mold allergens and toxins'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure triggers allergic sensitization and airway inflammation'
- 'Step 5: Leads to development and exacerbation of childhood asthma'

description: Biological exposures including mold were among the most assessed indoor environmental factors,
  with childhood asthma being the most examined outcome (54% of studies).

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Mold exposure reflects structural inequities in housing quality and maintenance.
    Low-income families are more likely to live in housing with moisture problems due to limited housing
    options, weak tenant protections, and landlord neglect. This creates differential exposure risks based
    on economic position rather than individual choices.
