direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extreme heat exposure creates acute physiological stress including elevated body temperature
  and hormonal changes'
- 'Step 2: Heat stress impairs executive function and emotional regulation'
- 'Step 3: Impaired cognitive control reduces ability to manage interpersonal conflicts non-violently'
- 'Step 4: Increased outdoor congregation during heat events creates more opportunities for violent encounters'
- 'Step 5: Escalation of conflicts results in serious violence including homicide'

description: The study analyzed homicide as part of Offences against the Person, finding correlations
  with temperature patterns. The relationship between climate stressors and specific crime types shows
  non-linear associations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Climate change and urban design decisions create differential heat exposure across
    neighborhoods. Lower-income areas often experience higher heat island effects due to less green space
    and more impervious surfaces, structurally producing higher violence exposure for marginalized communities.
