direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients lack awareness that FDA-approved medications (naltrexone, disulfiram, acamprosate)
  exist for treating alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Misunderstanding about medication effectiveness and mechanisms of action persists due to inadequate
  patient education'
- 'Step 3: Without accurate knowledge, patients do not request or accept MAUD when offered'
- 'Step 4: Low awareness translates to reduced initiation and retention on medication-assisted treatment
  for AUD'

description: Lack of patient awareness and misunderstanding about the effectiveness and effects of medications
  for alcohol use disorder (MAUD) serves as a significant barrier to treatment uptake. When patients do
  not know that effective medications exist or misunderstand how they work, they are less likely to initiate
  or remain on treatment.

  description: Person-centered discussions with providers about MAUD can increase patient knowledge and
    understanding
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects a healthcare system failure to adequately educate patients
    about available treatment options rather than individual patient deficiency. The burden falls on healthcare
    systems to provide accessible, culturally appropriate information about MAUD. Inequities in health
    literacy, language access, and provider communication practices may exacerbate this barrier for marginalized
    populations.
