mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OBOT settings vary in their delivery of patient-centered care including shared decision-making
  with providers'
- 'Step 2: Lack of patient-centered approaches reduces patient engagement and satisfaction with treatment'
- 'Step 3: Poor therapeutic alliance and limited shared decision-making decrease treatment retention'
- 'Step 4: Patients disengage from care, reducing medication treatment rates for OUD'

  description: Shared decision-making with providers was identified as an important element of patient-centered
    care that facilitates treatment engagement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies healthcare system quality factors rather than patient
    characteristics as determinants of treatment success. The burden is placed on healthcare systems to
    provide patient-centered care rather than on patients to comply with provider directives.
