- 'Step 1: Adult pineoblastoma patients receive radiotherapy as part of multimodal
  treatment following surgical resection'
- 'Step 2: Radiotherapy targets residual tumor cells and micrometastatic disease in
  the central nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Radiation-induced tumor cell death reduces disease burden and prevents
  recurrence'
- 'Step 4: Multivariate COX analysis demonstrates radiotherapy as an independent prognostic
  factor for improved survival (P<0.001)'

description: Systematic review of 108 adult pineoblastoma cases from 32 articles demonstrates
  that radiotherapy is an independent factor in beneficial prognosis. Kaplan-Meier
  survival analysis showed treatment modality including radiotherapy was significantly
  beneficial for survival. The 5-year survival rate was 49.5% and 10-year survival
  rate was 33.9%. Multivariate COX analysis confirmed radiotherapy as independently
  associated with improved outcomes.
