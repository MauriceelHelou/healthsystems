mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Harm reduction interventions (e.g., managed alcohol programs, needle exchanges) provide safer
  use alternatives and reduce chaotic substance use patterns'
- 'Step 2: Low-barrier services meet people experiencing homelessness where they are, reducing structural
  barriers to engagement'
- 'Step 3: Reduced acute harms from substance use may stabilize health and housing situations'
- 'Step 4: However, meta-analysis shows harm reduction approaches produce similar outcomes to treatment
  as usual for this population'

  intervention effectiveness varies

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural reality that people experiencing homelessness
    face unique barriers to substance use treatment. Harm reduction approaches attempt to address these
    structural barriers by providing low-threshold services. The finding that neither harm reduction nor
    abstinence approaches significantly outperform treatment as usual suggests deeper structural factors
    (housing instability, trauma, poverty) may need to be addressed alongside substance use treatment.
    The disproportionate rates of substance use in homeless populations stem from trauma, adverse childhood
    experiences, and using substances to cope with street living conditions.
