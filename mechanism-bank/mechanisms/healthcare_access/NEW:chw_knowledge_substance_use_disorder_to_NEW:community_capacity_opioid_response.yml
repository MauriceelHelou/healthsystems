- 'Step 1: CHWs gain knowledge on substance use disorder with focus on behavioral health integration'
- 'Step 2: Trained CHWs return to practice in local communities with enhanced skills'
- 'Step 3: Local community capacity to address opioid prescription misuse increases'
- 'Step 4: Medically underserved areas gain improved ability to respond to opioid epidemic'

description: Increased CHW knowledge translates to enhanced community-level capacity to address opioid
  use disorder in medically underserved areas, as trained CHWs return to practice in their local communities
  with behavioral health integration skills.

  description: Areas with fewer existing resources for opioid treatment may benefit more from CHW capacity
    building
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that community-level capacity to respond to the opioid
    epidemic is structurally determined by the presence of trained healthcare workers. Medically underserved
    areas lack specialists, creating a structural barrier to care. Building capacity at the community
    level through CHW training addresses this structural gap rather than expecting individuals to travel
    to distant treatment centers. This approach acknowledges that healthcare workforce distribution is
    a systemic issue requiring systemic solutions.
