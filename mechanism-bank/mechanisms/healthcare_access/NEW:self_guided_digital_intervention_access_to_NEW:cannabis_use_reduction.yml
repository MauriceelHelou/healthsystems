mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Online self-guided interventions reduce barriers to accessing substance use treatment by eliminating
  need for formal treatment settings'
- 'Step 2: Evidence-based behavior change approaches (SMART goals, mental contrasting with implementation
  intentions) are delivered remotely'
- 'Step 3: Individuals set personalized reduction or quit goals with structured support'
- 'Step 4: Goal achievement and cannabis use reduction occur through accessible, low-threshold intervention'

description: A two-week self-guided online intervention combining SMART goals with mental contrasting
  and implementation intentions (MCII) enabled adults with severe cannabis use disorder to achieve personal
  reduction goals, with 69% (MCII) and 60% (MCII + Cue-control) meeting objective targets compared to
  49% in control. Reductions were maintained at 3-month follow-up.
quantitative_effects:

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: International online study; geographic variation in cannabis use patterns and treatment-seeking
    behaviors may affect generalizability
moderators:
- name: intervention_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: MCII condition showed 69% objective goal achievement vs 49% in minimal control; adding
    cue-control did not enhance outcomes
- name: baseline_severity
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Participants experienced severe cannabis use disorder on average, yet still showed improvement
    suggesting intervention works across severity levels
- name: motivation_level
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Participants were pre-selected as motivated to reduce or quit use
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to treatment access. Many individuals
    prefer self-guided interventions over formal treatment due to stigma, cost, availability, and accessibility
    barriers. Digital interventions can democratize access to evidence-based care, particularly for populations
    underserved by traditional treatment systems. However, digital divide issues (broadband access, digital
    literacy) may create differential access by socioeconomic status.
