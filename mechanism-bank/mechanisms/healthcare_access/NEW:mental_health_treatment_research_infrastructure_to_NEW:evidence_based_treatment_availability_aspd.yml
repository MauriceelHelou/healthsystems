direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited research investment in personality disorder pharmacotherapy results in small, unreplicated
  studies'
- 'Step 2: Only 11 studies over decades, with data available from only 4 studies (274 participants)'
- 'Step 3: Insufficient evidence base prevents development of clinical guidelines'
- 'Step 4: Clinicians lack evidence-based pharmacological treatment options for AsPD'

description: 'The systematic review reveals profound structural gaps in mental health research: only 11
  RCTs exist for pharmacological treatment of AsPD, with extractable data from only 4 studies involving
  274 participants. All findings come from unreplicated single reports of mostly older medications, preventing
  evidence-based clinical recommendations.'

  description: Only three drug classes studied (antiepileptic, antidepressant, dopamine agonist) with
    mostly older medications, limiting therapeutic options
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exposes how structural underinvestment in mental health research
    perpetuates health inequities. AsPD is associated with criminality, unemployment, relationship difficulties,
    and premature death, yet receives minimal research attention compared to other psychiatric conditions.
    The population affected disproportionately includes those already marginalized by criminal justice
    involvement, substance use disorders, and socioeconomic disadvantage. The lack of evidence-based treatments
    represents a failure of healthcare systems to address a condition with significant public health burden
    and equity implications.
