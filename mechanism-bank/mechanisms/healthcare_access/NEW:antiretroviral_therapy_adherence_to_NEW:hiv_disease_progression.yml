mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adequate antiretroviral therapy adherence maintains drug levels to suppress viral replication'
- 'Step 2: Viral suppression prevents ongoing destruction of CD4+ T cells'
- 'Step 3: Preserved immune function prevents opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining conditions'
- 'Step 4: Disease progression to advanced HIV/AIDS stages is slowed or prevented'

description: The meta-analysis establishes that optimal ART adherence slows HIV disease progression. With
  only 70% adherence observed across the region, many patients may experience accelerated disease progression
  due to suboptimal viral suppression.

  description: Variable healthcare system capacity across Latin American and Caribbean countries affects
    ability to support adherence
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Disease progression in HIV is directly tied to healthcare system capacity to support
    medication adherence. Structural factors including healthcare access, medication supply chains, and
    social determinants unique to Latin American and Caribbean settings create differential vulnerability
    to disease progression that cannot be attributed to individual behavior alone.
