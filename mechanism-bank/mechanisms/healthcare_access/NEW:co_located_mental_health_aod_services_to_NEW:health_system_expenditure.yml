description: Integrated care with co-located mental health and AOD services is associated with reduced
  health system expenditure through decreased acute care utilization.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cost savings from integrated care represent efficiency gains from addressing systemic
    fragmentation. Current separate funding streams and regulatory silos create structural barriers to
    integrated service delivery that disadvantage complex patients.
