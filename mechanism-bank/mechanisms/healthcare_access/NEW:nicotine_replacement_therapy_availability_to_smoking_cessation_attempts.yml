description: NRT serves as a comparator showing lower effectiveness than nicotine EC for smoking cessation.
  The inverse of the primary finding (RR 1.55 favoring EC) indicates NRT is approximately 35% less effective
  than EC for achieving smoking abstinence at 6+ months.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: NRT access is mediated by healthcare system coverage, pharmacy availability, and
    affordability. Insurance coverage policies for NRT vs EC vary substantially and create differential
    access. Low-income smokers may have limited access to either cessation aid depending on Medicaid coverage
    and local policies.
