- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis receive evidence-based pharmacological treatment
  for AUD'
- 'Step 2: MAUD promotes alcohol abstinence (32% increase compared to placebo/standard care)'
- 'Step 3: Sustained abstinence halts ongoing alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and allows hepatic regeneration'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of further liver damage reduces progression to decompensated cirrhosis and liver
  failure'
- 'Step 5: Reduced liver disease progression decreases liver-related mortality'

description: By promoting alcohol abstinence through pharmacological intervention, MAUD indirectly reduces
  liver disease progression and mortality in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis. Alcohol abstinence
  is the cornerstone of treatment for alcohol-related liver disease, and this study demonstrates that
  MAUD provides an effective tool to achieve this goal in a population where treatment options have been
  historically limited.

  description: Patients with more advanced liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis) may have less hepatic
    regenerative capacity, potentially weakening the mortality benefit of abstinence
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural inequities in treatment access for patients
    with concurrent AUD and liver disease. Historically, these patients have been undertreated due to
    concerns about hepatotoxicity of AUD medications and exclusion from clinical trials. The good safety
    profile demonstrated (only 5 of 165 serious adverse events possibly medication-related) supports expanding
    access to these treatments. Structural barriers to address include provider education, insurance coverage
    for MAUD in liver disease settings, and integration of addiction medicine into hepatology care pathways.
