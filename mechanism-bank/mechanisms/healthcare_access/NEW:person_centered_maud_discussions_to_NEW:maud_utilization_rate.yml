- 'Step 1: Healthcare providers engage patients in individualized discussions about MAUD options'
- 'Step 2: Patient-specific perspectives, concerns, and preferences are elicited and addressed'
- 'Step 3: Education addresses knowledge gaps and misconceptions about medication effectiveness'
- 'Step 4: Stigma is reduced through non-judgmental, medically-framed conversations'
- 'Step 5: Shared decision-making increases patient buy-in for MAUD initiation and adherence'

description: The review identifies person-centered clinical discussions as a key strategy for improving
  MAUD uptake. Incorporating unique patient perspectives about MAUD into clinical conversations can increase
  patient knowledge, reduce stigma, and ultimately improve medication initiation and retention.

  equity_implications: Person-centered care is a healthcare system-level approach that requires structural
    supports including adequate appointment time, provider training, culturally competent communication
    resources, and clinical workflows that facilitate shared decision-making. Implementing this approach
    at scale requires systemic changes rather than relying on individual provider effort.
