mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with multiple SDoH risk factors face compounded barriers to healthcare access'
- 'Step 2: Reduced likelihood of referral for advanced heart failure therapies due to implicit bias'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of pre-transplant optimization and device candidacy evaluation'
- 'Step 4: Poorer post-operative follow-up due to transportation, housing, and economic barriers'
- 'Step 5: Decreased success rates of cardiac devices and transplantation'

description: Eight studies examined how SDoH affect success of medical devices and cardiac transplantation,
  with studies using multiple SDoH variables to capture cumulative disadvantage
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies used 1-9 SDoH as primary independent variables with 0-7 as controls, creating
    substantial heterogeneity

  description: Greater number of SDoH exposures compounds negative effects on outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural barriers compound to create disparities
    in access to life-saving advanced therapies. The review notes that transplant and device candidacy
    decisions may be influenced by SDoH factors, raising equity concerns about whether these decisions
    reflect true clinical criteria or structural bias. Interventions must address systemic barriers to
    transplant access.
