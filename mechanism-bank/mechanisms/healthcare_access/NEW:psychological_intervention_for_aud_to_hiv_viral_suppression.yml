description: The systematic review examined whether psychological interventions for AUDs could improve
  secondary HIV-related outcomes including viral load and CD4 count. The review found lack of evidence
  for sustained intervention effects on these HIV-related outcomes, mirroring the limited effects on primary
  alcohol use outcomes.

    platforms also used
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of sustained effects may reflect structural limitations of individual-level
    interventions that do not address broader social determinants. Healthcare system barriers, including
    access to integrated HIV and substance use treatment, may limit effectiveness. The review calls for
    methodological improvements but does not explicitly address structural barriers to care.
