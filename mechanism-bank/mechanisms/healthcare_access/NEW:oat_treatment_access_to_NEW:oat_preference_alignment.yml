mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Expanded access to diverse OAT options enables treatment matching'
- 'Step 2: Patients receiving preferred medication type show higher satisfaction'
- 'Step 3: Higher proportion of buprenorphine recipients (92%) preferred their current medication compared
  to methadone recipients (77%)'
- 'Step 4: Preference-aligned treatment may improve retention and outcomes'

description: Among those receiving OAT, a significantly higher proportion of buprenorphine recipients
  (92%) preferred their current medication compared to methadone recipients (77%), suggesting differential
  satisfaction and potential need for expanded treatment options.

  description: 92% of current buprenorphine recipients preferred their medication vs 77% of methadone
    recipients
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers to patient-centered care in OAT.
    When healthcare systems limit medication options, patients may receive treatments that do not align
    with their preferences, potentially affecting engagement and outcomes. The study calls for expanded
    take-home options and treatment variety as structural solutions.
