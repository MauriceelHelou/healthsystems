mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief alcohol interventions provide structured screening and early intervention before alcohol
  misuse progresses to disorder'
- 'Step 2: Interventions address both high-risk heavy drinkers and general population through universal
  prevention approaches'
- 'Step 3: Reduced drinking quantity (8% reduction) decreases cumulative alcohol exposure and associated
  neurobiological adaptations'
- 'Step 4: Early intervention during critical developmental periods (college years) may interrupt progression
  to alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 5: However, effect decay by 9-12 months suggests sustained intervention or booster sessions needed
  to prevent AUD development'

description: Brief alcohol interventions reduce mean alcohol consumption through 6 months, which may interrupt
  the pathway to alcohol use disorder development. The 8% reduction in drinks, while modest, represents
  a meaningful public health impact at population level. The decay of effects by 9-12 months highlights
  structural need for sustained intervention delivery systems.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that effects decay over time points to structural limitations of one-time
    interventions and the need for sustained environmental and policy supports. Alcohol use disorder development
    is influenced by broader structural factors including alcohol marketing, pricing policies, outlet
    density, and social environments that are not addressed by individual-level brief interventions. The
    predominantly White, college-attending sample reflects structural inequities in who receives preventive
    interventions.
