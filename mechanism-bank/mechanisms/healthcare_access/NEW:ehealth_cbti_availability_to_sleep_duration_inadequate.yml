mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: eHealth delivery of CBTI (eCBTI) expands access beyond traditional in-person therapy through
  telephone, videoconference, web-based programs, and mobile apps'
- 'Step 2: Expanded access reduces barriers related to geographic distance, scheduling constraints, and
  healthcare provider shortages'
- 'Step 3: Patients receive evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy addressing dysfunctional sleep
  beliefs, sleep restriction, and stimulus control'
- 'Step 4: Treatment leads to improvements in sleep quality and duration equivalent to in-person delivery'
- 'Step 5: Statistically significant reductions in insomnia severity and inadequate sleep duration'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 RCTs (N=1083) found that electronically delivered
  CBTI (via telephone, videoconference, web-based programs, or mobile apps) was statistically equivalent
  to in-person CBTI for most sleep and nonsleep outcomes. While conventional comparisons showed small
  effect sizes favoring in-person delivery, equivalence testing demonstrated clinical equivalence, supporting
  eHealth as a viable alternative to expand access to insomnia treatment.
quantitative_effects:
  p_value: 0.05
  sample_size: 1083
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The study specifically addresses limited accessibility to in-person CBTI as a rationale
    for eHealth alternatives, suggesting geographic variation in access to traditional insomnia treatment
moderators:
- name: treatment_duration
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Heterogeneity analyses identified treatment duration as a potential moderator of differences
    in treatment efficacy between delivery formats
- name: dropout_rates
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher dropout rates identified as potential moderator that may impact comparative efficacy
    between eCBTI and ipCBTI
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses a critical structural barrier to mental health treatment
    - geographic and logistical access to specialized therapists. By demonstrating equivalence of eHealth
    delivery, the study provides evidence supporting policy and healthcare system changes that could reduce
    disparities in insomnia treatment access. Populations in rural areas, those with transportation barriers,
    or those with scheduling constraints due to work or caregiving could benefit from expanded eHealth
    options. The structural focus is on healthcare delivery systems rather than individual behavior change.
