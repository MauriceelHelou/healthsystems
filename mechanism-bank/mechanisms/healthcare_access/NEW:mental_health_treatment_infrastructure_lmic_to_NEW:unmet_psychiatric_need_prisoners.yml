mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate mental health funding and workforce in LMICs creates severe treatment gaps'
- 'Step 2: Community mental health services are unavailable or inaccessible to marginalized populations'
- 'Step 3: Untreated mental illness increases vulnerability to incarceration through criminal justice
  contact'
- 'Step 4: Prison mental health services remain severely under-resourced, perpetuating unmet need'
- 'Step 5: High prevalence of psychiatric disorders in prisons reflects system failure rather than individual
  pathology'

description: The authors conclude that high psychiatric disorder prevalence 'likely reflects unmet needs'
  and call for 'development of scalable interventions' as 'a public health priority in resource-poor settings.'
  This frames the prison mental health crisis as a healthcare access and infrastructure problem.

  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly locates the problem in structural underinvestment in
    mental health systems, not in individual prisoners. The call for 'scalable interventions' acknowledges
    that solutions must be systemic. The concentration of psychiatric morbidity in prisons represents
    a failure of the healthcare system that gets addressed through incarceration - a form of structural
    violence against people with mental illness.
