mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: STRIVE intervention provides hospitals with Infection Control Assessment
  and Response (ICAR) and Practice Change Assessment (PCA) tools to self-identify
  gaps in infection control and CAUTI-specific prevention practices'
- 'Step 2: Web-based educational modules deliver training on foundational infection
  control practices and HAI-specific prevention strategies, including appropriate
  catheter use criteria'
- 'Step 3: State-level partners provide external facilitation, technical assistance,
  and coaching to support implementation of evidence-based catheter reduction practices'
- 'Step 4: Culture change components address staff engagement, competency-based training,
  audits, and feedback to sustain behavioral changes around catheter insertion decisions'
- 'Step 5: Targeted Assessment for Prevention (TAP) strategy resources help hospitals
  prioritize and focus interventions on units with highest catheter utilization burden'
- 'Step 6: Combined multimodal approach leads to reduced inappropriate urinary catheter
  insertions and earlier catheter removal, decreasing overall utilization rates'

description: The CDC STRIVE initiative is a multimodal hospital-level intervention
  externally facilitated by state-level partners that targets hospitals with elevated
  healthcare-associated infection rates. The intervention combines self-assessment
  tools (ICAR/PCA), web-based educational modules on infection control and CAUTI prevention,
  technical implementation assistance, and culture change strategies to reduce unnecessary
  urinary catheter use. A meta-analysis of similar multifaceted interventions demonstrated
  a pooled CAUTI incidence rate ratio of 0.54 compared with standard care, indicating
  substantial reduction in catheter-associated infections and utilization.

- name: Hospital setting (ICU vs non-ICU)
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Non-ICU settings showed more consistent progress in catheter utilization
    reduction compared to ICU settings during 2009-2014, though both improved between
    2013-2014
- name: Hospital type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: weak
  description: Intervention targeted acute care, long-term acute care, and critical
    access hospitals; effectiveness may vary by hospital type due to different baseline
    practices and resources
- name: Baseline HAI burden
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Hospitals with higher baseline HAI burden (cumulative attributable
    difference above first tertile) were specifically targeted, potentially showing
    greater room for improvement
