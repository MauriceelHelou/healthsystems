mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychiatric patients receive pharmacological treatments (antidepressants,
  mood stabilizers, antipsychotics) as part of clinical care'
- 'Step 2: Medications reduce symptom severity of underlying psychiatric disorders
  (depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced symptom severity decreases acute suicidal ideation and impulsivity
  associated with untreated mental illness'
- 'Step 4: Ongoing pharmacological treatment provides continued mood stabilization
  and reduces risk of suicidal crisis episodes'
- 'Step 5: Machine learning models identify pharmacological treatment status as a
  predictive feature associated with lower suicide risk, indicating protective effect'

description: This systematic review of 81 machine learning studies in psychiatric
  populations identified pharmacological treatments as one of the key features predicting
  suicide risk. The review found that ML models achieved 70% or greater accuracy using
  features including previous attempts, severity of disorder, and pharmacological
  treatments. The inclusion of pharmacological treatment status as a predictive feature
  in successful ML models suggests that treatment engagement and medication adherence
  are associated with reduced suicide risk in psychiatric populations.
