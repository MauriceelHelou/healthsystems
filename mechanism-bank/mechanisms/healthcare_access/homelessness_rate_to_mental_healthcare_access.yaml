- 'Step 1: Persons experiencing homelessness face systemic barriers to accessing healthcare
  services including lack of stable address, identification documents, and insurance
  coverage'
- 'Step 2: Shelter closures, social distancing requirements, and service disruptions
  reduce availability of walk-in and outreach mental health services that homeless
  populations rely upon'
- 'Step 3: Competing survival priorities (food, shelter, safety) take precedence over
  seeking mental healthcare, further reducing engagement with available services'
- 'Step 4: Stigma, distrust of healthcare systems, and lack of culturally competent
  services create additional barriers to mental healthcare utilization among homeless
  individuals'
- 'Step 5: Gaps in mental health support services for homeless populations persist
  and widen, resulting in unmet mental health needs and deteriorating mental health
  outcomes'

description: Higher homelessness rates are associated with reduced access to mental
  healthcare services. Persons experiencing homelessness face multiple structural
  barriers to mental healthcare including lack of stable address, insurance, transportation,
  and competing survival needs. The scoping review identified gaps in access to mental
  health support as a key concern, with pandemic conditions exacerbating existing
  disparities in service availability and utilization.
