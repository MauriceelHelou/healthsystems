mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited detoxification facility capacity creates shortage of treatment entry points'
- 'Step 2: Waivered NPs/PAs identify detoxification access as a key barrier to buprenorphine prescribing'
- 'Step 3: Patients requiring medically supervised withdrawal may not be able to access care'
- 'Step 4: Lack of detox access prevents seamless transition to buprenorphine maintenance'
- 'Step 5: Healthcare infrastructure gaps reduce overall OUD medication treatment rates'

description: Limited detoxification facility access is identified by waivered NPs/PAs as a key structural
  barrier to buprenorphine prescribing, representing healthcare infrastructure gaps that limit OUD treatment
  capacity
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 240
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Detoxification access likely varies significantly by geography, contributing to rural-urban
    disparities in OUD treatment
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Detoxification capacity is a healthcare infrastructure issue determined by funding,
    policy, and regional planning decisions. This structural barrier affects entire communities regardless
    of individual characteristics. Investment in treatment infrastructure addresses this root cause.
