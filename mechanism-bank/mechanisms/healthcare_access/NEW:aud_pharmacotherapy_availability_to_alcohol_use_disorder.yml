description: 'The review identified that 8 pharmacotherapies demonstrated small-to-medium effects (Cohen''s
  d range: |0.24 - 0.64|) on reducing cue-induced craving compared to placebo across 28 randomized trials.
  These laboratory findings inform the medications development pipeline for AUD treatment, with the upper
  effect size of 0.64 representing the strongest medication effects observed.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The pathway from medication development to AUD treatment involves multiple structural
    factors including research funding allocation, pharmaceutical development incentives, FDA approval
    processes, insurance coverage decisions, and healthcare system capacity for addiction treatment. Inequities
    in access to AUD pharmacotherapy reflect broader disparities in substance use treatment access, with
    underserved populations facing greater barriers to medication-assisted treatment. The review's focus
    on standardizing methodology aims to accelerate medication development, which could ultimately improve
    treatment access.
