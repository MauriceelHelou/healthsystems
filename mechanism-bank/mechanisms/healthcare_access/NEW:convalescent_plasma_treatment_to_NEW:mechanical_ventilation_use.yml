- 'Step 1: Convalescent plasma provides passive antibody therapy'
- 'Step 2: Antibodies may modulate immune response and viral replication'
- 'Step 3: Theoretical prevention of respiratory deterioration requiring ventilation'
- 'Step 4: Meta-analysis showed non-significant trend toward reduced ventilation (RR 0.76)'

description: Among peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary RR for mechanical ventilation use was 0.76 (95% CI
  0.20-2.87), with an absolute risk difference of -2.56% (95% CI -13.16% to 8.05%). The wide confidence
  intervals and low certainty of evidence indicate no significant benefit was demonstrated.

  equity_implications: Mechanical ventilation represents a critical healthcare resource that was severely
    strained during COVID-19 surges. Access to ventilators and ICU beds varied substantially by geographic
    region, hospital capacity, and healthcare system funding—structural factors that affected COVID-19
    outcomes inequitably.
