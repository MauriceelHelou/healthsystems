mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of standardized diagnostic criteria creates inconsistent case definitions across healthcare
  systems'
- 'Step 2: Different diagnostic frameworks (GINA vs ERS/ATS) capture different populations'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare providers apply varying thresholds for severe asthma diagnosis'
- 'Step 4: Systematic under- or over-diagnosis occurs based on institutional protocols'
- 'Step 5: True prevalence remains masked, preventing appropriate resource allocation'

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism reveals how healthcare system organization and clinical guideline
    governance affect disease recognition. Inconsistent diagnostic criteria may systematically disadvantage
    populations with less access to specialist care who might receive delayed or missed diagnoses. Equity
    implication: Children in under-resourced healthcare settings may be systematically under-diagnosed
    if providers lack training in standardized criteria.'
