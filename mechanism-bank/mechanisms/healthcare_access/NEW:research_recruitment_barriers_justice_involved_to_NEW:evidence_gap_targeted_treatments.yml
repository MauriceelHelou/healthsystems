direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Justice-involved young adults face unique challenges being recruited into clinical research
  due to mobility, contact information instability, and system distrust'
- 'Step 2: Difficulty recruiting this population limits development and testing of targeted interventions'
- 'Step 3: Lack of targeted treatments perpetuates worse outcomes for justice-involved young adults compared
  to other age groups'
- 'Step 4: Social media recruitment methods can address these structural barriers at low cost ($0.47-$0.66/click)'

description: Structural barriers to research recruitment among justice-involved young adults contribute
  to a gap in evidence-based treatments for this population. Social media recruitment provides a feasible,
  cost-effective solution to overcome these barriers and enable development of targeted interventions.

  description: Successfully recruited racially diverse sample (37.4% White, 20.6% Asian, 17.6% Black,
    19.8% Latinx, 6.1% American Indian, 6.1% Pacific Islander) suggesting method reduces selection bias
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how research infrastructure itself creates health inequities
    by systematically excluding hard-to-reach populations from clinical trials. The result is fewer evidence-based
    treatments developed for populations with the highest need. The solution (social media recruitment)
    represents a structural intervention to address systemic exclusion from research participation.
