direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher uninsured rates create financial barriers to healthcare access,
  preventing or delaying initial cancer screening and diagnostic services'
- 'Step 2: Lack of insurance coverage limits access to timely oncology care, appropriate
  treatment regimens, and supportive services for patients diagnosed with metastatic
  breast cancer'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to comprehensive cancer treatment (chemotherapy, targeted
  therapy, hormonal therapy, radiation) leads to suboptimal disease management'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate follow-up care and symptom management results in increased disease
  progression and complications'
- 'Step 5: These barriers culminate in higher mortality rates among metastatic breast
  cancer patients, with disproportionate impact on racial/ethnic minorities and low-income
  populations'

description: Higher uninsured rates are associated with increased mortality among
  patients with metastatic (de novo stage IV) breast cancer. Evidence from the National
  Cancer Database demonstrates that prior to Medicaid expansion, uninsured and racial/ethnic
  minority patients had significantly worse survival outcomes. The 2-year mortality
  rate decreased from 45.6% to 35.8% among minority patients following expansion,
  with mortality disparities between racial groups eliminated after insurance coverage
  was expanded. This indicates that lack of insurance coverage directly contributes
  to excess mortality in metastatic breast cancer through reduced access to appropriate
  oncologic care.
