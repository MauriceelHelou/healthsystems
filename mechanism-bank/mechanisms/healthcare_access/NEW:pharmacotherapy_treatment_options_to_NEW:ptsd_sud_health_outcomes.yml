mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Expanding pharmacological treatment options provides alternatives when psychosocial therapy
  barriers exist'
- 'Step 2: Pharmacotherapy can be delivered through primary care and general medical settings, improving
  geographic access'
- 'Step 3: Medication-based treatment may reduce time and travel burden compared to intensive psychotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Combined pharmacological and psychosocial approaches may improve outcomes beyond either alone'

description: The systematic review identified 16 pharmacotherapies across 29 studies as potential treatment
  options to enhance outcomes for co-occurring PTSD and SUD, addressing barriers present with psychosocial
  therapy-only approaches.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism addresses healthcare system structure as a determinant of outcomes.
    By identifying pharmacological options, the review aims to reduce structural barriers (geography,
    time, specialist availability) that limit access to psychosocial therapies. However, the review notes
    limitations: inconsistent dosing, populations, and outcome measures across studies prevented meta-analysis,
    indicating the need for more standardized research infrastructure.'
