mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cochlear implantation restores functional hearing in adults with severe-to-profound
  hearing loss'
- 'Step 2: Improved hearing ability reduces communication barriers and enhances self-management
  of health conditions'
- 'Step 3: Better hearing leads to reduced need for prescription medications (particularly
  for comorbid conditions like depression/anxiety associated with hearing loss)'
- 'Step 4: Improved health status and self-efficacy decrease frequency of surgical
  interventions and audiological visits'
- 'Step 5: Overall reduction in healthcare service utilization including hospital
  admissions, emergency department presentations, and GP visits'

description: Cochlear implantation in adults with hearing loss leads to reduced health
  service utilization. A systematic review of 9 studies examining health service utilization
  found that 5 out of 9 studies (55.6%) demonstrated benefits including reduced prescription
  medication use, fewer surgical interventions, and decreased audiological visits.
  The mechanism operates through restored hearing function enabling better self-management,
  reduced comorbidity burden, and decreased need for ongoing medical interventions.
