direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Residential treatment programs develop organizational cultures that prioritize psychosocial
  interventions over pharmacological approaches'
- 'Step 2: Cultural norms and treatment philosophy shape prescriber attitudes and willingness to recommend
  AUD medications'
- 'Step 3: Staff members communicate skepticism about pharmacotherapy to patients, reducing patient acceptance'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prescription and utilization of evidence-based AUD medications (naltrexone, acamprosate)'

description: Cultural norms and treatment philosophy against prescribing medications within residential
  treatment programs act as barriers to evidence-based AUD pharmacotherapy, contributing to underutilization
  of naltrexone and acamprosate
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The study notes wide variation in pharmacotherapy receipt across VA residential treatment
    programs, suggesting geographic and institutional variation

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies organizational culture and institutional philosophy as
    structural barriers rather than blaming individual patients or providers. The variation across programs
    indicates systemic rather than individual factors drive treatment disparities. Veterans who access
    certain programs face structural disadvantages in receiving evidence-based care.
