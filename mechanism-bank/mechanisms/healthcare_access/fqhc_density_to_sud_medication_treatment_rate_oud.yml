- 'Step 1: Greater availability of primary care facilities increases geographic access to potential OAT
  delivery points'
- 'Step 2: Primary care clinics may offer OAT with reduced stigma compared to specialty settings'
- 'Step 3: Co-location with primary care facilitates management of medical comorbidities'
- 'Step 4: Improved access may increase treatment uptake among underserved populations'
- 'Step 5: Evidence shows OAT reduces mortality by 50% when employed'

description: Expanding OAT delivery to primary care settings could address the gap between the proportion
  of people with OUD who could benefit from OAT (with 50% mortality reduction) and those currently receiving
  treatment. Primary care clinics are more numerous and may reduce stigma barriers to treatment.
quantitative_effects:

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Primary care access varies substantially by geography; rural areas often have fewer
    options for both primary and specialty care

  description: Effectiveness depends on primary care provider training and comfort with OUD treatment

  strength: moderate
  description: Primary care clinics with connections to specialty OUD clinics showed positive outcomes;
    isolated primary care may differ
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The low proportion of people with OUD receiving OAT despite strong evidence of
    benefit represents a structural failure of healthcare system design. Concentration of OUD treatment
    in specialty settings creates geographic and stigma barriers that disproportionately affect rural
    communities, low-income populations, and those lacking transportation. Expanding to primary care is
    a structural intervention addressing healthcare system design rather than individual behavior change.
