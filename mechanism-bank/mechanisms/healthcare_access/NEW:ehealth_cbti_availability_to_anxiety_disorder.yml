mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: eHealth CBTI expands access to evidence-based insomnia treatment through digital platforms'
- 'Step 2: Treatment addresses insomnia, which shares bidirectional relationships with anxiety disorders'
- 'Step 3: Both eCBTI and ipCBTI demonstrate statistically significant improvements in anxiety as a secondary
  outcome'
- 'Step 4: Improved sleep quality and reduced insomnia severity contribute to decreased anxiety symptoms'

description: The meta-analysis found that both eHealth and in-person CBTI led to statistically significant
  improvements in anxiety as a secondary outcome. This supports eHealth delivery as a means to expand
  access to treatment that addresses both insomnia and comorbid anxiety symptoms.
quantitative_effects:
  p_value: 0.05

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Access to mental health treatment varies geographically, making eHealth alternatives
    particularly relevant for underserved areas

  description: Treatment duration may moderate the comparative efficacy of delivery formats
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Anxiety disorders are more prevalent in populations facing socioeconomic stressors
    and with limited access to mental healthcare. By demonstrating that eHealth CBTI can address anxiety
    symptoms equivalently to in-person care, this finding supports structural interventions that could
    reduce treatment disparities for populations with limited access to in-person mental health services.
