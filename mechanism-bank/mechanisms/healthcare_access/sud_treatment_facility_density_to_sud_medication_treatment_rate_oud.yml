description: A public health demonstration project in Los Angeles County expanded access to extended-release
  naltrexone (XR-NTX) through collaboration between the Department of Public Health and UCLA. Implementation
  across multiple Service Planning Areas increased medication availability for patients with opioid and
  alcohol use disorders, with 609 patients receiving treatment over 3 years.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 609
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: XR-NTX was accessed by providers in 6 of 8 Service Planning Areas of Los Angeles County,
    indicating geographic variation in implementation and access across the county
moderators:
- name: substance_use_severity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: XR-NTX recipients reported more severe substance use histories compared to general LA County
    SUD patients, suggesting the intervention reached higher-need populations
- name: criminal_justice_involvement
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Study showed higher cessation rates and lower average doses compared to similar projects
    with parolees/probationers, suggesting non-justice-involved populations may have different retention
    patterns
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how public health infrastructure and inter-agency collaboration
    can expand access to evidence-based addiction treatment. The geographic variation (6 of 8 Service
    Planning Areas reached) highlights structural disparities in treatment availability. The focus on
    system-level implementation rather than individual patient factors appropriately frames addiction
    treatment as a healthcare access issue requiring structural solutions.
