direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited geographic availability of OBOT programs in underserved neighborhoods and suburban
  settings creates structural barriers to care'
- 'Step 2: Patients face transportation, scheduling, and practical challenges accessing distant treatment
  facilities'
- 'Step 3: Reduced OBOT access leads to suboptimal follow-up with referrals and lower treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Decreased retention in medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder'

description: Geographic maldistribution of office-based opioid treatment programs creates structural barriers
  to medication-assisted treatment, particularly affecting underserved and suburban communities

  variation_notes: Study specifically identified limited access to OBOT programs in underserved neighborhoods
    and suburban settings as a barrier

  description: Suburban settings also face limited OBOT access compared to urban centers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system infrastructure and geographic distribution
    of treatment resources create inequitable access to evidence-based OUD treatment. The barrier is structural
    (location of services) rather than individual (patient motivation or compliance).
