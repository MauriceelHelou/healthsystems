direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical
  intervention'
- 'Step 2: Mastectomy removes entire breast tissue including areas that may harbor residual cancer cells
  after chemotherapy'
- 'Step 3: More complete tissue removal reduces likelihood of local recurrence and microscopic residual
  disease'
- 'Step 4: Lower recurrence rates translate to longer disease-free survival periods'
- 'Step 5: Extended disease-free intervals improve overall prognosis and quality of life'

description: Meta-analysis of 10 studies (n=5018) demonstrated that mastectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  was associated with significantly better 5-year disease-free survival compared to breast-conserving
  surgery (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.80-5.38, p<0.0001) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment decisions regarding surgical approach are influenced by structural factors
    including healthcare system protocols, provider training and preferences, patient education and informed
    consent processes, and access to reconstructive surgery. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in breast
    cancer treatment patterns are well-documented, potentially leading to differential access to optimal
    surgical approaches and subsequent survival disparities.
