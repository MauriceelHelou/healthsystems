mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SBIRT education and training programs build provider knowledge and skills'
- 'Step 2: Access to high-quality SBIRT resources supports implementation in practice'
- 'Step 3: Clear guidelines and policies provide institutional support for screening activities'
- 'Step 4: Trained providers are more likely to screen patients for alcohol problems systematically'

  rates of alcohol screening practice, with lack of training identified as a major barrier to implementation.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses workforce development as a structural determinant of preventive
    care delivery. The gap between provider willingness (most believe SBIRT is appropriate) and practice
    (fewer actually screen) indicates systemic training deficits rather than individual resistance. Investment
    in healthcare workforce capacity is a policy lever for improving alcohol prevention.
