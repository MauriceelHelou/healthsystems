mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Harm reduction services including drug checking capacity identify dangerous adulterants in
  drug supply'
- 'Step 2: Drug checking information enables people who use drugs to make informed decisions about dosing
  and use'
- 'Step 3: Naloxone distribution through harm reduction services increases overdose reversal capability'
- 'Step 4: Regular contact with harm reduction services facilitates rapid response to contaminated supply
  emergencies'

description: Integration of harm reduction services including drug checking within housing environments
  may reduce overdose mortality by providing information about drug supply and facilitating access to
  naloxone and emergency response.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 106
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Drug supply composition varies by region; study leverages existing drug checking infrastructure
    in Boston area
moderators:
- name: drug_supply_contamination
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Study explicitly examines drug supply as outcome, recognizing that fentanyl contamination
    increases importance of harm reduction
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses overdose as a consequence of unregulated drug supply and
    lack of safe consumption infrastructure rather than individual drug use choices. Drug checking represents
    a structural public health response to poisoning crisis.
