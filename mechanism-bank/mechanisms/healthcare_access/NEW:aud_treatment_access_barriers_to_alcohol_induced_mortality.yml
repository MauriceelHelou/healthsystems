- 'Step 1: Limited access to treatment (few approved medications, provider shortages, stigma) leaves AUD
  under-treated'
- 'Step 2: Continued heavy alcohol use leads to liver disease, cardiovascular complications, and other
  organ damage'
- 'Step 3: Lack of pharmacological support for reducing drinking accelerates health decline'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol-induced mortality from untreated AUD'

description: The paper's emphasis on AUD being 'severely under-treated' implies structural healthcare
  access barriers contribute to ongoing alcohol-related harms including mortality. Expanding pharmacotherapy
  options is positioned as a structural intervention to reduce these harms.

  description: Presence of comorbid mental health or medical conditions may accelerate mortality in untreated
    AUD
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Under-treatment of AUD is a healthcare system failure, not individual non-compliance.
    The paper advocates for expanding approved medications and improving access as structural solutions
    to reduce alcohol-related mortality.
