description: Fecal microbial transplant interventions show the most promise among microbiome interventions
  for treating alcohol-associated liver disease, suggesting potential for microbiome-targeted therapies.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to emerging microbiome interventions like FMT will likely be limited by
    healthcare system barriers including insurance coverage, geographic availability, and provider knowledge.
    Without policy attention to equitable access, these interventions may widen health disparities.
