mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems and researchers apply diverse implementation strategies
  based on local barriers and contexts'
- 'Step 2: Variation in strategy selection leads to differences in which structural
  barriers are addressed'
- 'Step 3: No universal strategy was used across all studies, suggesting context-specific
  approaches'
- 'Step 4: Effectiveness of increasing medication receipt varies based on match between
  strategies deployed and actual barriers present'
