mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD compromises immune system function, reducing capacity to fight TB infection'
- 'Step 2: Hepatotoxicity from both alcohol and TB medications creates treatment complications'
- 'Step 3: Poor adherence to treatment leads to drug resistance development'
- 'Step 4: Social marginalization of individuals with dual diagnosis limits healthcare engagement'
- 'Step 5: Treatment failure, relapse, and increased mortality result from untreated comorbid AUD'

description: The systematic review identifies that AUD is associated with poor tuberculosis treatment
  outcomes. With 30% of TB patients having AUD, this represents a major structural challenge for TB control
  programs globally.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism illustrates how siloed healthcare systems fail patients with comorbid
    conditions. Structural factors include: lack of integrated screening protocols, insufficient training
    of TB program staff in AUD identification, absence of linkage to SUD treatment services, and systemic
    barriers to addressing social determinants (housing, food security) that affect both conditions. The
    geographic variation in prevalence suggests structural healthcare capacity differences across regions.
    Equity implications include disproportionate burden on marginalized populations who face barriers
    to accessing integrated care.'
