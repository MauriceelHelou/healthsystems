- 'Step 1: Workforce shortages in mental health and addiction treatment limit availability of trained
  CBT therapists'
- 'Step 2: Limited therapist availability creates geographic and appointment accessibility barriers'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with AUD face delays or inability to access evidence-based psychotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Treatment capacity shortage results in unmet need for AUD treatment'

description: Workforce shortages in mental health and addiction treatment create structural barriers to
  accessing evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy for AUD, contributing to treatment capacity shortages.
  This structural barrier motivated the development of internet-based CBT as an alternative delivery mechanism.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Workforce shortages and access barriers vary geographically, creating differential
    access to AUD treatment across regions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural healthcare system factor (workforce shortage)
    rather than individual-level barriers. The shortage of trained providers is a systemic issue related
    to training pipelines, reimbursement structures, and healthcare policy. This creates inequitable access
    that disproportionately affects rural and underserved communities.
