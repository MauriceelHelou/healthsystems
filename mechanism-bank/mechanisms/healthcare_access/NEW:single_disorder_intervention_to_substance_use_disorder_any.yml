description: Subgroup analysis revealed that the most promising effect sizes for integrated CBI were observed
  when compared to single-disorder interventions (typically AOD-only treatments) rather than when added
  to usual care. This suggests integrated approaches provide added value beyond standard single-disorder
  treatment.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that single-disorder interventions are less effective for individuals
    with co-occurring conditions reflects structural failures in healthcare organization. Policy and reimbursement
    structures that incentivize siloed care create systemic disadvantages for complex patients. This represents
    a structural determinant of treatment effectiveness and equity.
