description: Negative attitudes and stigma among probation practitioners toward medication-assisted treatment
  creates barriers to OUD treatment access for supervised individuals, with particular stigma against
  methadone compared to other FDA-approved medications.

  description: Probation leaders knew less about methadone and its administration compared to buprenorphine
    and naltrexone, contributing to differential referral patterns
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Practitioner stigma reflects broader societal stigmatization of people with substance
    use disorders and of medication-based treatment approaches. This institutional stigma within the criminal
    justice system compounds the marginalization of justice-involved individuals with OUD, creating compounding
    disadvantages for an already vulnerable population.
