- 'Step 1: Primary health care settings implement systematic alcohol use screening programs (SBIRT)'
- 'Step 2: Higher screening coverage identifies greater proportion of risky drinkers in the population'
- 'Step 3: Identified risky drinkers receive brief intervention (BI) or referral to treatment (RT)'
- 'Step 4: Brief interventions provide motivational counseling and feedback on drinking patterns'
- 'Step 5: Population-level alcohol consumption decreases as more individuals reduce drinking following
  intervention'

description: Simulation modeling demonstrates that increasing SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and
  Referral to Treatment) coverage in German primary health care from the current 2.9% to 50% of patients
  would result in 21% of adult residents receiving intervention over 10 years, leading to 12% lower population-level
  alcohol consumption. The model uses effect sizes from meta-analyses to estimate intervention impact
  on individual drinking behavior.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system infrastructure as a structural determinant
    of population health. The current low screening rate (2.9%) represents a system-level failure rather
    than individual behavior. The intervention works through healthcare access and delivery systems, emphasizing
    that reducing alcohol harm requires structural changes in how primary care is delivered. The model
    accounts for socioeconomic factors (education) that influence both access to care and drinking patterns.
    High coverage may only be achievable long-term, requiring complementary policy approaches for immediate
    impact.
