- 'Step 4: Treatment retention allows for addressing co-occurring conditions and social determinants'

description: The paper references strong existing evidence that opioid agonist treatment is effective
  in reducing overdose deaths. This establishes the clinical pathway by which restricted access to OAT
  in criminal justice populations translates to preventable mortality. When justice-involved individuals
  are denied access to OAT, they face elevated overdose risk.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The well-established effectiveness of OAT in reducing overdose mortality makes
    the structural barrier created by the criminal justice system particularly egregious from an equity
    standpoint. Justice-involved populations, who already face elevated mortality risk upon release from
    incarceration, are systematically denied the most effective treatment available. This represents a
    structural determinant of health inequity that operates through policy and institutional arrangements
    rather than individual behavior.
