mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited research and development of tobacco cessation interventions for pregnant women with
  co-occurring substance use'
- 'Step 2: Treatment programs lack integrated approaches addressing both tobacco and other substance use
  simultaneously'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare providers have insufficient evidence-based protocols for this population'
- 'Step 4: Pregnant women with substance use disorders have reduced access to effective smoking cessation
  support'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of successful smoking cessation attempts and outcomes in this population'

description: The shortage of specialized treatment capacity and evidence-based interventions for pregnant
  women with co-occurring substance use disorders creates a structural barrier to successful tobacco cessation,
  as existing treatment systems are not designed to address the complex needs of this population.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how healthcare system design and research priorities create
    structural inequities. The lack of targeted interventions for pregnant women with polysubstance use
    reflects systemic underinvestment in marginalized populations. Research and treatment systems have
    historically separated tobacco from other substances, failing to recognize the interconnected nature
    of addiction in disadvantaged populations. This represents a structural failure requiring policy-level
    solutions including research funding, integrated treatment models, and workforce training.
