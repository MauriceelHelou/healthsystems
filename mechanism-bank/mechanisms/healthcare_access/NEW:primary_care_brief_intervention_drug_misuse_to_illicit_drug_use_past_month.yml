mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care facilities integrate drug misuse screening into routine care delivery'
- 'Step 2: Screening identifies individuals with at-risk or problematic drug use patterns'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention provides structured counseling focused on reducing drug use'
- 'Step 4: Patient receives motivational feedback and personalized strategies for behavior change'
- 'Step 5: Drug use frequency and severity decrease following intervention'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol aims to determine whether brief interventions
  delivered in primary care settings can effectively reduce drug misuse, as measured by drug use frequency
  scores and severity scores at 4-8 months follow-up. The review will synthesize evidence from randomized
  controlled trials comparing brief intervention to no intervention, minimal screening/assessment, or
  usual care.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare system capacity to integrate substance use
    screening and intervention into primary care, which represents a structural approach to drug misuse
    prevention. Primary care integration reduces barriers to substance use services by embedding them
    in settings with broad population reach. Equity implications are explicitly addressed through planned
    subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity and insurance status, recognizing that access to quality primary
    care varies significantly by social position. The approach shifts burden from individual help-seeking
    to system-level screening, reducing stigma barriers.
