category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hospitalization provides opportunity for OUD treatment initiation in controlled environment'
- 'Step 2: Rapid titration achieves therapeutic dose during hospital stay rather than over weeks in outpatient
  setting'
- 'Step 3: Therapeutic dosing reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings while patient is still hospitalized'
- 'Step 4: Symptom control reduces patient-directed discharge (leaving against medical advice)'
- 'Step 5: Retained patients can be linked to outpatient methadone continuation at discharge'

description: Only 1 of 25 patients (4%) had a patient-directed discharge during rapid inpatient methadone
  initiation, suggesting this protocol may help retain patients in the hospital setting and facilitate
  linkage to ongoing OUD treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment dropout is often framed as patient non-compliance, but this mechanism
    highlights how healthcare system structures (slow titration protocols) may inadvertently drive patients
    away from treatment. By adapting protocols to the inpatient setting's monitoring capabilities, the
    healthcare system can better serve patients with OUD who might otherwise leave before achieving therapeutic
    benefit. This is particularly relevant for marginalized populations who may have fewer opportunities
    for consistent outpatient follow-up.
