- 'Step 1: High population-level ART adherence leads to widespread viral suppression'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexual transmission (U=U)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced community viral load decreases probability of transmission during potential exposure
  events'
- 'Step 4: New HIV infection rates decline at the population level'

description: The abstract explicitly states that optimal ART adherence decreases HIV transmission rates.
  With regional adherence at 70%, suboptimal adherence at the population level may limit the effectiveness
  of treatment as prevention strategies in Latin America and Caribbean.

  description: Treatment as prevention effectiveness depends on proportion of PLWH on ART achieving adherence
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: HIV transmission prevention through treatment adherence requires structural investment
    in healthcare systems, not just individual behavior change. The 70% adherence rate reflects healthcare
    system capacity and socioeconomic conditions that create barriers to optimal treatment outcomes, perpetuating
    transmission in structurally disadvantaged communities.
