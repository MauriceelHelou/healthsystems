direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ACA Medicaid expansion increases eligibility for low-income adults regardless
  of pregnancy or parental status'
- 'Step 2: Expansion increases preconception and postpartum Medicaid coverage with
  corresponding declines in uninsurance and insurance churn'
- 'Step 3: Improved insurance continuity enables better access to prenatal care, postpartum
  visits, and ongoing maternal health services'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced maternal healthcare access contributes to reduced rates of low
  birthweight and preterm births, particularly among minority populations'
- 'Step 5: Improvements in birth outcomes and maternal health lead to reductions in
  infant mortality, especially through reduced racial and ethnic disparities'

description: Systematic review of 24 studies found that ACA Medicaid expansion increased
  preconception and postpartum Medicaid coverage while reducing uninsurance and insurance
  churn. While overall evidence for improved infant birth outcomes was limited, some
  studies reported reduced racial and ethnic disparities in low birthweight and preterm
  births, which are key contributors to infant mortality.
