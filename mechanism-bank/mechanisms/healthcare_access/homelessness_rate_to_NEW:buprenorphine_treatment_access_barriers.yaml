direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates physical constraints including lack of stable address,
  transportation limitations, and inability to reliably store medications, preventing
  access to traditional brick-and-mortar buprenorphine clinics'
- 'Step 2: Homeless individuals face discrimination and logistical barriers at pharmacies,
  including requirements for photo identification that they may lack'
- 'Step 3: Strict clinic inclusion criteria (urinary toxicology requirements, scheduled
  appointments, insurance documentation) systematically exclude homeless populations
  from standard buprenorphine treatment protocols'
- 'Step 4: Lack of reliable communication methods (phone, address) prevents follow-up
  care essential for buprenorphine treatment compliance'
- 'Step 5: Financial barriers including lack of insurance and inability to navigate
  insurance activation processes compound access difficulties'

description: Homelessness creates multiple, compounding barriers to buprenorphine
  treatment access including physical constraints (lack of address, transportation),
  administrative requirements (photo ID, insurance, toxicology screens), discrimination
  at pharmacies, and inability to maintain reliable communication for follow-up. These
  barriers result from traditional clinic-based treatment models that assume stable
  housing and resources.
