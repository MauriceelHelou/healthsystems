description: The multicomponent CARE intervention targets treatment retention as a high-priority quality
  indicator, using systematic quality improvement processes and data-driven decision making to enhance
  6-month retention in opioid use disorder treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment retention is framed as a system-level quality indicator rather than individual
    client compliance. The intervention recognizes that structural factors in treatment delivery (workforce
    capacity, quality improvement infrastructure, measurement systems) determine retention outcomes, shifting
    responsibility from clients to treatment systems.
