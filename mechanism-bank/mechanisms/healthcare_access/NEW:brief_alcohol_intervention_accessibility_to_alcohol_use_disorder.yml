direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Interventions are immediately accessible without referral in online, community, or health settings'
- 'Step 2: Removal of structural barriers (no formal treatment-seeking required) enables early intervention'
- 'Step 3: Hazardous and harmful drinkers receive intervention before developing more severe disorder'
- 'Step 4: Both practitioner and digital interventions achieve small but population-level significant
  reductions'
- 'Step 5: Reduced progression from hazardous drinking to alcohol use disorder at population level'

description: Accessible alcohol interventions delivered without requiring formal treatment-seeking can
  achieve population-level impact on hazardous drinking, even with small individual effect sizes, due
  to high prevalence of the risk behavior

  description: Impact is greater in populations with higher prevalence of hazardous/harmful drinking
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes that structural accessibility (no referral required,
    multiple settings) is key to reaching non-treatment-seeking populations who comprise the majority
    of hazardous drinkers. Traditional treatment models that require identification and referral miss
    most at-risk individuals. Health systems and policies that integrate brief interventions into routine
    settings can achieve greater equity by reaching populations who face barriers to formal treatment.
    The public health impact depends on structural factors like healthcare integration, insurance coverage,
    and community infrastructure.
