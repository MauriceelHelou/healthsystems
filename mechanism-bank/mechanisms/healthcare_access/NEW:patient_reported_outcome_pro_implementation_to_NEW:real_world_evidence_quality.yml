- 'Step 1: Standardized PRO instrument selection enables consistent measurement of patient experiences
  across healthcare settings'
- 'Step 2: Stakeholder collaboration and education/training improve PRO data collection fidelity and completeness'
- 'Step 3: Proper PRO implementation processes reduce burden on healthcare professionals and patients,
  increasing participation'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced data collection and management protocols improve data quality and reliability'
- 'Step 5: Higher quality real-world evidence informs regulatory, reimbursement, and health policy decisions'

description: 'This systematic review identifies eight categories of PRO-specific recommendations for RWE
  generation: instrument selection, participation/engagement, burden management, stakeholder collaboration,
  education/training, implementation processes, data collection/management, and data analysis/presentation.
  Proper implementation of PROs enhances RWE quality for regulatory and policy decision-making.'

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers in healthcare evidence systems -
    the lack of standardized international guidance creates inequities in how patient perspectives inform
    policy. Different stakeholder groups (patients, providers, regulators, industry) have varying access
    to influence PRO guidance development. The paper explicitly calls for considering needs of various
    stakeholder groups to reduce structural barriers in evidence generation for health policy.
