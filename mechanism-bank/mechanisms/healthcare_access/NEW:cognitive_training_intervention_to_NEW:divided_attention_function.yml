description: Cognitive training improves divided attention (Hedges' g = 0.38) in older adults with MCI,
  though with wider confidence intervals indicating more variability in this domain. Divided attention
  is essential for safe driving and multitasking.

  equity_implications: Divided attention deficits are directly linked to risky driving mentioned in the
    abstract. Access to cognitive training as secondary prevention could reduce transportation-related
    injuries in aging populations, but such programs may not be available or affordable in all communities.
