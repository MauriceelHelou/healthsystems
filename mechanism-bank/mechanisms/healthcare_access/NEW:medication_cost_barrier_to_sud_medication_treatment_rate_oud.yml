  node_id: sud_medication_treatment_rate_oud
  node_name: SUD Medication Treatment Rate
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High prices of alcohol dependence medications create financial barriers for patients seeking
  treatment'
- 'Step 2: Patients unable to afford medications may forego or discontinue pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 3: Reduced medication uptake leads to lower overall utilization rates of evidence-based pharmacological
  treatments'
- 'Step 4: Lower treatment rates result in poorer outcomes for individuals with alcohol use disorder'

description: High medication costs serve as a structural barrier preventing patients with alcohol dependence
  from accessing pharmacotherapy, contributing to widespread underutilization of evidence-based treatments.

  variation_notes: Study found higher medication use in Italy compared to other countries, attributed
    to free medication access

  description: When medications are provided free of charge, utilization rates increase substantially
    compared to settings where cost barriers exist
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies cost as a systemic barrier rather than blaming individuals
    for non-adherence. The study demonstrates that when structural barriers (cost) are removed, medication
    uptake improves, suggesting policy interventions around medication affordability could improve treatment
    rates.
