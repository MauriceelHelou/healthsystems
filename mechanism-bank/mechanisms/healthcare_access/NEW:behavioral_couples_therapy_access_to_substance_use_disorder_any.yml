mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Behavioral couples therapy (BCT) engages both the patient with substance use disorder and their
  intimate partner in treatment'
- 'Step 2: Couple-based intervention addresses relationship dynamics that may perpetuate substance use
  patterns'
- 'Step 3: Partner involvement provides additional monitoring, support, and accountability for recovery'
- 'Step 4: Improved relationship satisfaction reinforces abstinence and reduces triggers for substance
  use'
- 'Step 5: Reduced frequency of substance use leads to better long-term recovery outcomes'

  with effects maintained at 12-month follow-up (g=0.32). The intervention addresses substance use within
  the context of intimate relationships, leveraging partner support as a structural resource for recovery.

  description: BCT showed larger effect size (g=0.23) when compared to individual-based treatment versus
    control conditions (g=0.17)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how treatment modality structure (couple-based vs individual)
    creates differential recovery outcomes. Access to BCT may be limited by relationship status, partner
    willingness, availability of trained providers, and insurance coverage - creating potential inequities
    in who can benefit from this more effective treatment approach.
