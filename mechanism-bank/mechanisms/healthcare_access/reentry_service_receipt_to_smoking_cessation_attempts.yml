mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-release and post-release interventions are delivered to individuals exiting smoke-free
  prisons'
- 'Step 2: These interventions strengthen intention to remain abstinent from tobacco'
- 'Step 3: Integrated services connect smoking cessation with other substance use treatment'
- 'Step 4: Social support networks for quitting are facilitated through reentry services'
- 'Step 5: Increased likelihood of quit attempts and sustained abstinence following release'

description: The review identifies that structured reentry services incorporating smoking cessation support
  can improve quit attempts and sustained abstinence among formerly incarcerated individuals. The combination
  of pre-release preparation and post-release support appears critical for success.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Geographic variation likely exists in availability of reentry services and smoking
    cessation support across different jurisdictions

  description: Interventions delivered both pre- and post-release appear more effective than single-timepoint
    interventions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately centers structural interventions (reentry services,
    integrated treatment systems, social support facilitation) rather than individual willpower. It recognizes
    that formerly incarcerated populations face systematic barriers to health-promoting behaviors and
    require coordinated system-level support. The equity implications are significant given the disproportionate
    incarceration of marginalized communities and the health disparities associated with smoking.
