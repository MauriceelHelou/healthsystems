  alcohol interventions in emergency settings, even when providers believe such interventions are appropriate
  and needed.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies healthcare workforce policy as a structural determinant
    of preventive care access. The paper explicitly notes that implementation challenges exist 'in the
    context of global workforce shortages.' UEC workers advocate for 'increased staff capacity and/or
    dedicated health promotion teams onsite' as structural solutions rather than expecting individual
    providers to do more with less.
