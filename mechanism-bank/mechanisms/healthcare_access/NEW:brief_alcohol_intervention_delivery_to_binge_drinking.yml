- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems implement brief alcohol interventions (ABIs) in clinical settings'
- 'Step 2: Trained practitioners deliver screening, advice, and motivational support to patients'
- 'Step 3: Patients receive personalized feedback on alcohol consumption and associated risks'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness and motivation leads to behavioral modification'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption'

description: Brief alcohol interventions delivered in healthcare settings produce small but statistically
  significant reductions in alcohol consumption quantity. The pooled effect size of 0.15 standard deviations
  represents a meaningful population-level impact when scaled across healthcare systems.

    showed strongest evidence base
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system capacity and workforce configuration
    (particularly nursing staff) can address population alcohol consumption. The finding that setting
    does not significantly moderate effectiveness suggests potential for expanding ABIs beyond primary
    care to reach populations with limited primary care access. The structural implication is that healthcare
    workforce investment in training nurses for ABI delivery could maximize population health impact.
