mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of multicomponent quality improvement intervention (CARE) provides clinical
  training and tools to treatment staff'
- 'Step 2: External facilitation supports clinics in adopting evidence-based practices and quality improvement
  processes'
- 'Step 3: Electronic client-reported treatment progress tools enable data-driven decision making'
- 'Step 4: Systematic organizational changes tied to quality metrics improve medication prescribing practices'
- 'Step 5: Increased utilization of medications for opioid use disorder among clients'

description: The CARE intervention provides systematic quality improvement support to substance use disorder
  treatment clinics, hypothesized to improve medication utilization for opioid use disorder through staff
  training, external facilitation, and data-driven decision-making tools.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers in the treatment system including
    workforce capacity limitations and lack of systematic quality improvement processes. The intervention
    targets organizational/system-level change rather than individual client behavior, recognizing that
    treatment quality is shaped by structural factors like resource availability and staff training infrastructure.
