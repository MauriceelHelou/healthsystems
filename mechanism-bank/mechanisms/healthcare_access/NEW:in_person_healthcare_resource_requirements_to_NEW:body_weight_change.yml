- 'Step 1: Traditional in-person lifestyle counseling programs require significant healthcare system resources
  and infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Resource-intensive requirements create access barriers for patients in underserved areas or
  those facing time and transportation constraints'
- 'Step 3: Limited access results in inability of most patients to achieve clinically significant weight
  loss'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers to in-person care perpetuate weight-related health conditions at population
  level'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly identifies structural healthcare system factors as barriers
    to health improvement. The paper frames the failure of traditional approaches not as individual patient
    non-compliance but as inherent structural limitations of resource-intensive care models. This structural
    competency perspective recognizes that healthcare delivery systems themselves can perpetuate health
    inequities when they require resources (time, transportation, provider availability) that are inequitably
    distributed across populations.
