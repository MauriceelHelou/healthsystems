- 'Step 1: Abstinence-based interventions require complete cessation of substance use as treatment goal'
- 'Step 2: These interventions may include residential treatment, 12-step programs, or contingency management
  requiring abstinence'
- 'Step 3: For homeless populations, abstinence requirements may create barriers to treatment engagement
  and retention'
- 'Step 4: Meta-analysis shows abstinence-based approaches produce similar outcomes to treatment as usual
  for this population'

  equity_implications: The lack of differential effectiveness between abstinence and harm reduction approaches
    for homeless populations points to the need for structural interventions addressing root causes. The
    abstract notes that homeless individuals use substances to cope with street living stress, stay warm,
    and block traumatic memories - suggesting that substance use is a structural symptom of housing instability,
    trauma, and social disadvantage rather than simply an individual behavior problem. Treatment approaches
    that don't address these structural factors may have limited effectiveness.
