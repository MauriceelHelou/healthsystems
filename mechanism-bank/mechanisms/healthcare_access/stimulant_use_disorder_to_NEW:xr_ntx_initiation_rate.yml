category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: XR-NTX requires complete opioid detoxification before initiation, creating a structural barrier'
- 'Step 2: Active stimulant use may complicate or destabilize the detoxification process'
- 'Step 3: Withdrawal management is more difficult to complete with ongoing stimulant use'
- 'Step 4: Substantially reduced likelihood of successfully initiating XR-NTX treatment'

description: Among rural people who inject drugs, stimulant use reduced the likelihood of initiating extended-release
  naltrexone by 76%. XR-NTX requires complete detoxification before administration, creating a structural
  barrier that is particularly difficult to overcome for individuals with concurrent stimulant use.

  description: Rural people who inject drugs showed a 76% reduction in XR-NTX initiation associated with
    stimulant use, the largest effect observed across all populations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding reveals how medication requirements (detoxification before XR-NTX)
    interact with polysubstance use patterns to create treatment barriers. Rural populations already face
    limited access to MOUD providers and detoxification services. The combination of geographic isolation,
    polysubstance use, and medication-specific requirements creates compounded structural barriers to
    evidence-based treatment. Equity implications include the need for expanded low-barrier treatment
    options and integrated services addressing both stimulant and opioid use disorders.
