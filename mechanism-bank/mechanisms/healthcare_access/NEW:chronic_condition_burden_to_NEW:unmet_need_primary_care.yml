direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic conditions increase frequency of healthcare needs and complexity of care'
- 'Step 2: Multiple conditions require coordination across specialists, increasing system navigation burden'
- 'Step 3: Higher healthcare utilization needs strain individual capacity and resources'
- 'Step 4: Complex care needs may exceed available appointment availability and provider capacity'
- 'Step 5: Gap between care needs and system capacity manifests as unmet primary care needs'

description: Individuals with chronic conditions have higher rates of unmet primary care needs, reflecting
  a mismatch between complex healthcare needs and system capacity to deliver accessible, coordinated care.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Heterogeneous findings across studies suggest variation may depend on local healthcare
    system capacity and organization

  description: Having a family physician was negatively associated with unmet need, potentially providing
    better care coordination for chronic conditions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding reveals how healthcare system design fails to adequately serve those
    with the greatest needs. The association between chronic conditions and unmet need reflects structural
    inadequacies in care coordination, appointment availability, and system navigation support rather
    than individual failure to seek care.
