mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Supervised consumption facilities provide sterile, monitored environments
  where people who use drugs can consume pre-obtained substances under clinical supervision'
- 'Step 2: Trained staff monitor for signs of overdose and can immediately intervene
  with naloxone administration, oxygen, and other emergency responses'
- 'Step 3: Rapid on-site intervention prevents fatal overdose outcomes that would
  occur in unsupervised settings where help may not be available'
- 'Step 4: Facilities also connect clients to addiction treatment services and healthcare,
  potentially reducing long-term overdose risk through treatment engagement'

description: Supervised consumption facilities significantly decrease lethal overdoses
  by providing immediate medical intervention during overdose events and connecting
  clients to care. Evidence from a systematic review of systematic reviews (30 reviews,
  442 primary studies) demonstrates that these facilities reduce fatal overdose outcomes
  and other high-risk behaviors without significant harms.
