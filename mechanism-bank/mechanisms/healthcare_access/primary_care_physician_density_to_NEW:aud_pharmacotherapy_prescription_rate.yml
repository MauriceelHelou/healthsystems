direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care serves as the main point of contact for individuals with alcohol use disorders,
  with less than 20% seeking any treatment'
- 'Step 2: Greater primary care access increases opportunities for AUD identification and management'
- 'Step 3: GPs can prescribe anti-craving medications (Disulfiram, Acamprosate, Naltrexone) for withdrawal
  and craving management'
- 'Step 4: Increased pharmacotherapy prescriptions support AUD treatment outcomes'

description: Primary care is a strategic setting for AUD identification and management, yet pharmacotherapy
  knowledge and prescription rates remain insufficient. The review found that despite international recommendations
  for AUD pharmacotherapy, very few studies examine AUD management in primary care settings.

  variation_notes: Studies conducted across multiple regions (Europe, North America, Australia, South
    Africa) suggesting geographic variation in primary care AUD management practices

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers in healthcare systems that prevent
    adequate AUD treatment. The low treatment uptake (<20%) reflects systemic failures in healthcare organization
    rather than individual patient choices. Lack of adapted guidelines for primary care practice represents
    a structural gap that perpetuates treatment inequities.
