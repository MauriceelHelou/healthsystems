direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gross total resection (GTR) achieves complete surgical removal of the pineoblastoma
  tumor mass from the pineal region'
- 'Step 2: Complete tumor removal eliminates the primary source of malignant cells,
  reducing tumor burden and potential for local progression'
- 'Step 3: GTR provides better conditions for adjuvant therapies (radiotherapy and
  chemotherapy) by minimizing residual disease that could serve as a nidus for recurrence'
- 'Step 4: Reduced tumor burden translates to improved survival outcomes compared
  to subtotal resection or no surgery, particularly within the first five years post-diagnosis'

description: Gross total resection of adult pineoblastoma is associated with improved
  survival compared to subtotal resection or no surgery. Kaplan-Meier analysis across
  108 cases from 32 studies demonstrated significant survival benefit (P=0.018) over
  a 10-year follow-up period. While multivariate COX analysis showed GTR tends to
  improve survival within five years (P=0.079), the combination of GTR with radiotherapy
  and chemotherapy provides the best prognostic outcomes for this rare CNS malignancy.
