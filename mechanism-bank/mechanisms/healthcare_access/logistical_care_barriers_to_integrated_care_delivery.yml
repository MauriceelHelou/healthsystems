category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fragmented healthcare delivery systems require multiple appointments across different providers'
- 'Step 2: Transportation, work schedule, and childcare barriers limit ability to attend frequent appointments'
- 'Step 3: Complex prior authorization and referral processes delay specialized care'
- 'Step 4: Poor care coordination between addiction specialists, hepatologists, and primary care'
- 'Step 5: Reduced implementation of integrated care models needed for effective ALD management'

description: Structural barriers in healthcare delivery systems prevent implementation of integrated care
  models essential for effective ALD management, particularly affecting populations with limited resources
  for navigating complex systems.

  variation_notes: Rural areas face greater logistical barriers due to provider shortages and longer travel
    distances to specialized care

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights how healthcare system organization creates differential
    access to care. The problem is system design, not patient compliance. Integrated care models represent
    a structural solution that addresses root causes rather than expecting individuals to navigate fragmented
    systems. Equity implication: Populations with fewer resources (time, transportation, flexible work)
    are disproportionately affected by care fragmentation.'
