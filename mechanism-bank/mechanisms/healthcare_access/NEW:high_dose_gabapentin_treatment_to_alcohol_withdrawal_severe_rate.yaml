direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-dose gabapentin (≥1800 mg/day) is administered to patients hospitalized
  with alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS)'
- 'Step 2: Gabapentin modulates GABAergic neurotransmission and voltage-gated calcium
  channels, counteracting the neuronal hyperexcitability characteristic of alcohol
  withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: This pharmacological action reduces the severity of alcohol withdrawal
  symptoms including anxiety, tremor, and autonomic instability'
- 'Step 4: Reduced symptom severity leads to decreased benzodiazepine requirements
  and potentially shorter hospital length of stay'
