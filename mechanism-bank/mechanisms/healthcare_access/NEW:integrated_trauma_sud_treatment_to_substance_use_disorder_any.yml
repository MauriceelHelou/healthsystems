  use'

description: Integrated psychological interventions showed no consistent evidence of effect on SUD outcomes.
  Two studies showed small positive effects while two showed small negative effects, indicating current
  treatments may not adequately address substance use in this population.

    moderator

  equity_implications: The lack of consistent treatment effects on SUD highlights how current healthcare
    models may inadequately address the structural roots of substance use in trauma survivors. Treatment
    models may need to address social determinants (housing, employment, social support) alongside psychological
    symptoms. High attrition reflects structural barriers to sustained treatment engagement.
