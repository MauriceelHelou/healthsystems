direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural populations historically had inferior insurance coverage compared to urban residents'
- 'Step 2: Insurance integration policy equalizes benefits and reimbursement rates across rural/urban
  populations'
- 'Step 3: Rural residents gain improved access to diagnostic services and chronic disease management'
- 'Step 4: Increased healthcare utilization leads to better disease control and prevention'
- 'Step 5: Rural chronic disease prevalence drops from 67.09% to 43.66%'

description: 'Rural participants showed an 84% reduction in chronic disease risk after URRBMI policy implementation
  (OR=0.16, 95% CI: 0.14-0.19). Prior to the policy, rural participants had 30% lower risk compared to
  urban participants (OR=0.70, 95% CI: 0.60-0.82), but this relationship shifted dramatically post-implementation.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural health policy reform can address historically
    embedded geographic inequities. The urban-rural divide in China's healthcare system reflects deeper
    structural inequalities tied to economic development policies, migration restrictions, and resource
    allocation decisions. By targeting the insurance system structure rather than individual behaviors,
    this policy addresses root causes of health disparities. The findings highlight how universal health
    coverage advances health equity for marginalized rural populations.
