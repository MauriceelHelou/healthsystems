- 'Step 1: Voucher-based contingency management carries symbolic value beyond monetary worth'
- 'Step 2: Symbolic recognition of patient efforts enhances perceived provider support'
- 'Step 3: Strengthened therapeutic alliance increases patient trust in treatment process'
- 'Step 4: Improved alliance promotes sustained engagement and reduces treatment discontinuation'
- 'Step 5: Lower dropout rates improve treatment completion and outcomes'

description: The symbolic value of contingency management vouchers extends beyond their monetary worth
  to strengthen therapeutic alliance between patients and healthcare providers, which reduces treatment
  dropout rates for alcohol use disorder.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare delivery structures and provider-patient
    relationship quality mediate treatment outcomes. Rather than attributing treatment dropout to patient
    characteristics, it identifies modifiable features of treatment delivery that can be structurally
    enhanced. The therapeutic alliance represents a healthcare system quality factor that can be systematically
    improved through intervention design. This shifts focus from individual patient blame for poor engagement
    to system-level opportunities for improvement.
