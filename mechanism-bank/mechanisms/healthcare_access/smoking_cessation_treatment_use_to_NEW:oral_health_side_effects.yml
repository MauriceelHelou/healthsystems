category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) deliver nicotine through oral routes (gum, lozenges)
  or other delivery systems'
- 'Step 2: Oral NRT formulations involve direct contact with oral mucosa and sustained nicotine exposure'
- 'Step 3: Local tissue exposure may cause oral side effects including irritation, ulceration, and xerostomia'
- 'Step 4: These effects must be weighed against cessation benefits in clinical and public health decision-making'

description: Nicotine replacement therapies are included as a category of NCNPs in this planned systematic
  review. The comparative oral health effects of FDA-approved NRTs versus other NCNPs and versus continued
  smoking will be assessed.

  description: Different NRT delivery methods (gum, lozenge, patch, inhaler) have varying levels of direct
    oral exposure
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to nicotine replacement therapy is shaped by healthcare system factors including
    insurance coverage, pharmacy access, and clinical recommendation patterns. Understanding oral side
    effects of NRTs can inform clinical counseling and may affect adherence to cessation treatment, particularly
    among populations with existing oral health disparities or limited dental care access.
