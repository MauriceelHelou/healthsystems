direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Scaling and root planing (SRP) removes subgingival bacterial biofilm and
  calculus, reducing chronic periodontal infection and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Reduction of periodontal inflammation decreases systemic inflammatory mediators
  (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, CRP) that contribute to insulin resistance'
- 'Step 3: Decreased systemic inflammation improves insulin sensitivity and glucose
  metabolism'
- 'Step 4: Adjuvant therapies (antibiotics, photodynamic therapy, laser) enhance bacterial
  reduction and anti-inflammatory effects, amplifying glycemic improvements'
- 'Step 5: Improved glycemic control is reflected in reduced HbA1c levels over 3+
  months follow-up'

description: Non-surgical periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing with or without
  adjuvants) improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
  chronic periodontitis. A Bayesian network meta-analysis of 14 RCTs demonstrated
  that SRP reduces HbA1c levels compared to no treatment (MD -0.399%), with adjuvant
  therapies (particularly photodynamic therapy with doxycycline) providing additional
  benefits. The mechanism operates through reduction of chronic oral infection and
  systemic inflammation, which improves insulin sensitivity.
