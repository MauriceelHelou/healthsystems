direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural place of residence is associated with greater geographic distance to pediatric trauma
  centers'
- 'Step 2: Increased distance leads to longer emergency medical transport times'
- 'Step 3: Delayed access to specialized pediatric trauma care after injury occurs'
- 'Step 4: Potential for worse health outcomes due to delayed definitive treatment'

description: Place of residence affects children's access to trauma care after injury, with rural residents
  potentially facing greater barriers to accessing specialized pediatric trauma services.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Rural vs urban residence is explicitly identified as a PROGRESS-Plus factor; geographic
    variation in trauma care access is a core focus of the review

  description: Well-organized regional trauma systems may mitigate rural-urban disparities
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on structural geographic factors rather than individual
    choices. Health system organization and resource distribution create disparities in trauma care access
    that disproportionately affect rural populations.
