mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minority of TB trials report key acceptability measures: 35% report study
  withdrawal, 20% report temporary discontinuation, 40% report permanent discontinuation,
  27.5% report adherence'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate reporting prevents understanding of real-world treatment tolerability
  and factors driving discontinuation'
- 'Step 3: Lack of patient-reported outcomes and standardized definitions limits comparability
  across trials'
- 'Step 4: Clinicians and patients lack information to make informed treatment decisions
  based on acceptability profiles'
- 'Step 5: Treatment recommendations inadequately account for tolerability, potentially
  leading to poor adherence and worse outcomes'
