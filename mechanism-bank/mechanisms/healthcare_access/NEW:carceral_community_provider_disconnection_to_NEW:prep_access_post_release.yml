direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carceral institutions and community healthcare providers operate in separate systems with limited
  communication'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare records and treatment plans are not effectively transferred during release'
- 'Step 3: Organizations must balance protecting confidentiality while attempting to coordinate care'
- 'Step 4: Lack of warm handoffs and established referral pathways creates gaps in care continuity'
- 'Step 5: Reduced access to PrEP and HIV prevention services during the critical post-release period'

description: The disconnection between carceral institutions and community healthcare providers limits
  linkage to care post-release. This structural gap is identified as one of five key implementation barriers,
  compounded by the challenge of balancing confidentiality protection with care coordination.

  description: Organizations face tension between protecting confidentiality and coordinating care, which
    can impede information sharing needed for care linkage
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a systems-level failure in healthcare coordination that
    creates barriers independent of individual behavior. The structural separation between carceral and
    community health systems reflects historical siloing of services and lack of investment in transition
    care infrastructure. This disproportionately harms populations cycling through incarceration who face
    fragmented care systems.
