mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mental health diagnoses create additional barriers to navigating healthcare systems'
- 'Step 2: Stigma in healthcare settings may deter individuals from seeking primary care'
- 'Step 3: Mental health conditions may affect ability to maintain appointments and follow through on
  care'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system fragmentation separates mental health from primary care services'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative barriers result in higher rates of unmet primary care needs'

description: Individuals with mental health diagnoses experience higher rates of unmet need for primary
  care, reflecting healthcare system fragmentation and structural barriers that disproportionately affect
  this population.

  description: Integration of mental health and primary care services may reduce barriers for those with
    mental health diagnoses
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system organization creates differential
    access for vulnerable populations. Rather than attributing unmet needs to individual mental health
    symptoms, this finding points to structural issues including system fragmentation, provider bias,
    and inadequate integration of services. Addressing this requires system-level changes rather than
    individual-level interventions.
