mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bridge clinics provide same-day access to medications for SUD including buprenorphine'
- 'Step 2: Removal of prior authorization and waiting period barriers enables immediate medication initiation'
- 'Step 3: Transition to community-based providers maintains medication continuity'
- 'Step 4: 68% of follow-up participants continued taking SUD medications, with 46% on buprenorphine'

description: Bridge clinic model facilitates medication-assisted treatment for SUD, with 68% of patients
  continuing medications at follow-up and 46% specifically on buprenorphine, demonstrating that low-barrier
  access to medications improves ongoing pharmacotherapy utilization.

  equity_implications: The traditional barriers to medication-assisted treatment (X-waiver requirements,
    prior authorizations, limited prescribers) create structural inequities in accessing evidence-based
    OUD treatment. This model demonstrates that structural interventions removing these barriers improve
    medication treatment rates.
