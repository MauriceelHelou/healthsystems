direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system fails to universally implement SBIRT protocols for patients with alcohol-associated
  liver disease (only 51.7% of AAH, 23.7% of DARLC patients received intervention)'
- 'Step 2: Patients discharged without addiction treatment referral lack connection to outpatient alcohol
  use disorder services'
- 'Step 3: Absence of treatment continuity results in return to pre-hospitalization drinking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Continued alcohol use causes ongoing hepatic injury and disease progression'
- 'Step 5: Progressive liver damage leads to recurrent decompensation requiring rehospitalization'

description: 'The study documents a major implementation gap: less than half of actively drinking patients
  hospitalized for alcohol-associated hepatitis received SBIRT intervention, and less than a quarter of
  those with decompensated cirrhosis received it. This structural failure in healthcare delivery perpetuates
  cycles of hospitalization by missing critical opportunities for addiction treatment linkage.'

  description: Patients with more advanced disease (DARLC vs AAH) received SBIRT at even lower rates (23.7%
    vs 51.7%), potentially reflecting provider nihilism about addiction treatment benefit in advanced
    disease
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism exemplifies structural determinants of health through healthcare
    system organization. The implementation gap is a system-level failure, not a patient-level one. Structural
    factors that may contribute include: lack of addiction medicine consultation services, absence of
    standardized SBIRT protocols, provider training gaps, stigma toward addiction within hepatology/gastroenterology,
    and resource constraints. The disparity in SBIRT rates between AAH and DARLC patients (51.7% vs 23.7%)
    may reflect implicit biases about treatment futility in advanced disease, representing a form of structural
    discrimination against patients with more severe presentations.'
