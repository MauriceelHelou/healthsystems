  outcome'

description: Both eHealth and in-person CBTI resulted in statistically significant improvements in fatigue
  as a secondary outcome. This supports the role of accessible insomnia treatment in addressing the broader
  health impacts of sleep disorders.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Fatigue disproportionately affects workers in physically demanding occupations
    and those with limited access to healthcare. Expanding eHealth access to effective insomnia treatment
    could reduce health disparities related to occupational and socioeconomic factors.
