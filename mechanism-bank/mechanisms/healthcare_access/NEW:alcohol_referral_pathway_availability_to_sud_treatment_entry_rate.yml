mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Timely referral pathways enable emergency department providers to connect patients with alcohol
  treatment'
- 'Step 2: Well-funded treatment services increase capacity to accept referrals from emergency settings'
- 'Step 3: Streamlined referral processes reduce patient loss during care transitions'
- 'Step 4: Increased treatment entry rates improve population-level alcohol use disorder outcomes'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system infrastructure rather than patient
    compliance. The study identifies lack of timely referral pathways as a structural barrier that prevents
    care continuity. Inadequate funding for treatment services is a policy failure that creates systemic
    gaps in the alcohol care continuum.
