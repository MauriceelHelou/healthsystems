mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: XR-NTX administered to criminal justice-involved individuals with OUD upon release'
- 'Step 2: Medication blocks opioid effects but does not provide comprehensive reentry support'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers (housing instability, unemployment, lack of social support) remain unaddressed'
- 'Step 4: No significant difference in time to first arrest between treatment groups'

description: Time to first arrest did not significantly differ between XR-NTX and TAU groups (adjusted
  HR 1.35, CI 0.96-1.89), indicating that medication treatment for OUD does not delay recidivism without
  addressing broader structural determinants of criminal justice involvement.

  equity_implications: The lack of effect on time to arrest further supports the conclusion that addressing
    opioid use alone through pharmacotherapy is insufficient. Criminal justice involvement is driven by
    multiple structural factors including poverty, lack of opportunity, and systemic marginalization that
    persist regardless of medication status.
