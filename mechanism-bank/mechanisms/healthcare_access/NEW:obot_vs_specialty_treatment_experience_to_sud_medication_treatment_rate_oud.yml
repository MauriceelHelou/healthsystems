- 'Step 1: OBOT settings offer integrated primary care-based treatment with generally favorable patient
  experiences'
- 'Step 2: Specialty addiction treatment settings may have different structures, requirements, and patient
  experiences'
- 'Step 3: Differential experiences influence patient preferences for treatment setting'
- 'Step 4: Favorable OBOT experiences support treatment retention and medication adherence'

description: Patient responses were generally favorable towards OBOT with buprenorphine compared to specialty
  addiction treatment, suggesting that treatment setting characteristics influence engagement and retention
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 23
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare delivery models (integrated primary care
    vs. specialty siloed care) create different patient experiences that affect treatment outcomes. This
    is a structural characteristic of healthcare organization rather than patient preference.
