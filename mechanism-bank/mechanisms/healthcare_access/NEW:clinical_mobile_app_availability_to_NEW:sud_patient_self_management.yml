description: Mobile applications for SUD patients (primarily pain medication diaries and trackers) can
  support self-management, though current apps lack clinical integration necessary for adequate healthcare
  standards in the opioid crisis.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals a structural gap in healthcare technology development where
    market-driven app development occurs without clinical integration or quality standards. The finding
    that 36 apps exist but none meet clinical standards reflects healthcare system fragmentation and inadequate
    regulatory frameworks for digital health tools. This creates potential for health inequities as patients
    may rely on inadequate tools without clinical guidance.
