description: Health system capacity for virtual training delivery enabled continuation of alcohol SBI
  implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This unplanned adaptation demonstrates the importance of
  flexible implementation infrastructure.

    during dynamic circumstances
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare infrastructure and organizational flexibility
    function as structural determinants of service delivery. The pandemic exposed structural vulnerabilities
    in implementation approaches that relied solely on in-person modalities. Systems with greater adaptive
    capacity could maintain prevention services, while those without such capacity may have experienced
    gaps in service delivery.
