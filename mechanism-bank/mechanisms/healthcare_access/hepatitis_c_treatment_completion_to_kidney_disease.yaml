- 'Step 1: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receive direct-acting antiviral
  (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, achieving viral eradication
  rates greater than 95%'
- 'Step 2: Successful HCV treatment eliminates ongoing viral-mediated inflammatory
  processes and immune complex deposition that contribute to glomerulonephritis and
  other HCV-associated kidney diseases'
- 'Step 3: Eradication of HCV infection removes the independent risk factor for faster
  CKD progression, resulting in slower decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
  after treatment compared to before treatment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced kidney inflammation and improved metabolic parameters slow the
  progression of chronic kidney disease toward end-stage renal disease'

description: Direct-acting antiviral treatment for hepatitis C virus achieves viral
  eradication in over 95% of patients with chronic kidney disease. HCV infection has
  been identified as an independent risk factor for faster CKD progression, related
  in part to HCV-associated glomerulonephritides but also independent of this connection.
  Studies show that successful HCV treatment results in slower decline in glomerular
  filtration rate after treatment compared to before treatment in patients with eGFR
  less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2, suggesting that viral eradication slows CKD progression.
