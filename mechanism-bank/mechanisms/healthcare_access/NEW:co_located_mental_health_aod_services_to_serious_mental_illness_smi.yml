mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Co-location eliminates need for patients to travel between separate service locations'
- 'Step 2: Integrated treatment teams can address bidirectional relationship between substance use and
  mental illness'
- 'Step 3: Simultaneous treatment of both conditions prevents each from exacerbating the other'
- 'Step 4: Improved mental health symptom severity through coordinated pharmacological and psychosocial
  interventions'

  equity_implications: Healthcare system fragmentation is a structural barrier that particularly impacts
    marginalized populations who face multiple barriers to accessing care. Siloed service delivery reflects
    policy and funding structures rather than patient needs or preferences.
