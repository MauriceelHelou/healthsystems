mechanism_pathway:
  - 'Step 1: Integration of behavioral health into primary care enables routine alcohol screening (AUDIT, CAGE) identifying AUD early'
  - 'Step 2: Co-located or embedded addiction counselors reduce fragmentation and "no-show" rates from referral to separate specialty care'
  - 'Step 3: Primary care-based medication for alcohol use disorder (MAT) prescribing increases treatment access in familiar, low-stigma setting'
  - 'Step 4: Warm handoffs and care coordination between primary care and BH specialists improve treatment engagement'
  - 'Step 5: Ongoing primary care touchpoints provide continuous engagement and retention in addiction treatment, reducing dropout'

  equity_implications: Fragmented care separating medical and addiction treatment is not natural but reflects historical stigma and discriminatory insurance practices. Carve-out behavioral health systems were deliberately designed to limit costs by creating access barriers. Integrated care remains rare because fee-for-service payment doesn't support care coordination. Safety-net health centers serving marginalized populations pioneered integration out of necessity but face inadequate reimbursement. Communities of color and rural populations benefit most from integration but have least access. The fragmentation-retention gradient reflects policy choices about payment models, parity enforcement, and whether addiction care is treated as legitimate healthcare. High treatment dropout from fragmented systems represents institutional discrimination making addiction care deliberately difficult to access. Addressing this requires: value-based payment supporting integration, robust parity enforcement, technical assistance and funding for safety-net integration, medical education reform, and challenging stigma separating addiction from "real" medicine.
assumptions:
  - 'Integration includes co-location of BH providers in primary care and/or primary care-based MAT prescribing'
  - 'Mechanism operates through reduced access barriers and improved care coordination'
  - 'Assumes primary care as usual source of care; doesn't apply to uninsured without access'
limitations:
  - 'Integration model and quality varies widely across practices'
  - 'Requires adequate staffing and training which is resource-intensive'
  - 'May not address severe AUD requiring residential or intensive specialty care'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Integrated care availability varies by practice resources, payment models, and state policies

    - 'Rural areas with provider shortages benefit most from primary care-based MAT but have least capacity'
    - 'Academic medical centers and integrated delivery systems (Kaiser) show advanced integration models'
