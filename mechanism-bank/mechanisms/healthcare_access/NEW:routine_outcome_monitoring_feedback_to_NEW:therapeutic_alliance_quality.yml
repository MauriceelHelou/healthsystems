  description: Feedback to both clients and clinicians may have stronger effects on therapeutic alliance
    than feedback to one party alone
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Therapeutic alliance is influenced by healthcare system practices and protocols,
    not solely individual provider characteristics. ROM represents a structural intervention that standardizes
    quality improvement processes and creates conditions for better provider-client relationships.
