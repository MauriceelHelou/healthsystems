direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural regions have limited access to MOUD providers and treatment facilities'
- 'Step 2: People who inject drugs in rural areas face geographic barriers to treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Limited healthcare infrastructure compounds the negative effects of stimulant use on treatment
  initiation'
- 'Step 4: Reduced rates of MOUD initiation compared to urban populations'

description: Rural populations with high rates of injection drug use experience limited access to MOUD
  treatment. When combined with stimulant use, these structural barriers result in a 39% reduction in
  likelihood of initiating MOUD treatment. The effect is more pronounced than in other populations studied.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights geographic inequities in substance use treatment access.
    Rural communities face systematic underinvestment in addiction treatment infrastructure, creating
    structural barriers to evidence-based care. The finding that stimulant use effects are amplified in
    rural settings reflects how place-based disadvantages compound individual-level risk factors. Addressing
    this requires policy interventions expanding MOUD availability in rural areas, including telehealth
    services and hub-and-spoke treatment models.
