mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Veteran status confers eligibility for VA healthcare system with specialized trauma services'
- 'Step 2: Military service experiences create specific trauma profiles and help-seeking patterns'
- 'Step 3: VA system culture and peer veteran presence may enhance treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Veterans demonstrate stronger response to trauma-focused psychotherapy for alcohol outcomes
  compared to civilians receiving similar treatments'

description: Veteran status serves as a causal moderator of treatment effectiveness for co-occurring PTSD
  and SUD. Veterans showed stronger beneficial effects from trauma-focused psychotherapy (both PTSD-focused
  and integrated PTSD+SUD) compared to treatment as usual for alcohol use severity outcomes. This moderation
  effect was specific to alcohol outcomes and was not observed for PTSD symptoms or drug use severity.

  description: Veteran status moderation effect was specific to alcohol use outcomes when receiving trauma-focused
    treatments vs treatment as usual; no differential effect found for PTSD or drug use outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies veteran status as a structural factor influencing treatment
    response, likely reflecting differences in healthcare system access, trauma type, military culture,
    and treatment context. Rather than individual-level differences, this points to how social and institutional
    structures (military service, VA healthcare system) shape treatment outcomes. Equity implications
    include recognizing that civilians with similar co-occurring conditions may lack access to the integrated,
    trauma-informed care systems available to veterans, potentially explaining differential outcomes.
    Policy should focus on extending veteran-level trauma services to civilian populations.
