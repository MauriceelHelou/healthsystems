description: The integrated telemedicine AUD intervention produced significant reductions in anxiety symptom
  severity (t[22]=2.87, p<0.01), with symptoms decreasing from the moderately severe range at baseline
  to the mild range at treatment-end.
quantitative_effects:
  p_value: 0.01
  sample_size: 23
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Anxiety disorders often co-occur with AUD and may result from self-medication patterns
    or physiological effects of alcohol. Structural barriers to integrated treatment perpetuate both conditions.
    This intervention demonstrates that accessible, integrated care can address multiple mental health
    conditions simultaneously.
