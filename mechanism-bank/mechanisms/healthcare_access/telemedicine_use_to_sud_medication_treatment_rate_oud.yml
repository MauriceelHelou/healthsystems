direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic accelerated shift toward telemedicine and online counseling for substance
  use treatment'
- 'Step 2: Telemedicine expands geographic reach and reduces transportation barriers to treatment access'
- 'Step 3: Virtual visits may reduce stigma barriers associated with in-person treatment facility attendance'
- 'Step 4: Increased convenience and accessibility promotes treatment initiation and retention'
- 'Step 5: However, this benefit is conditional on having adequate digital access and skills'

description: The shift toward telemedicine for substance use treatment during COVID-19 created both opportunities
  and barriers, with benefits accruing primarily to those with adequate digital access while potentially
  widening disparities for digitally excluded populations
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Telemedicine benefit varies by geography, with greater potential impact in rural areas
    but also greater digital access barriers

  description: The benefit of telemedicine expansion is contingent on having digital access, creating
    a digital divide in who benefits from this treatment modality
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system adaptations can inadvertently exacerbate
    inequities when implemented without attention to underlying structural barriers. Policy solutions
    require both expanding telemedicine AND addressing digital access disparities simultaneously.
