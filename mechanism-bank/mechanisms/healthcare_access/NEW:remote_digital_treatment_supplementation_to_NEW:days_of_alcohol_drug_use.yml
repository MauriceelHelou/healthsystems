mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Remote/digital interventions supplement existing in-person alcohol/drug treatment'
- 'Step 2: Increased frequency of therapeutic contact through accessible technology-based platforms'
- 'Step 3: More consistent monitoring and support reduces periods of unmonitored vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced self-management skills and real-time coping support during high-risk situations'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in total days of substance use during treatment and recovery period'

description: Remote/digital interventions supplementing in-person alcohol/drug treatment reduce days of
  substance use. The meta-analysis used standardized mean differences to pool effects across diverse measurement
  approaches for substance use frequency.

  description: Both telephone and computer-based delivery were evaluated; supplementation of in-person
    care shows clearer benefits than replacement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Reducing days of use through enhanced treatment accessibility addresses structural
    barriers that prevent consistent engagement with traditional treatment models. This approach can particularly
    benefit populations facing transportation barriers, rural isolation, or inflexible work schedules
    that make in-person appointments difficult.
