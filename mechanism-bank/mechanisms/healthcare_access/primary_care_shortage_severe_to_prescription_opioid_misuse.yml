- 'Step 4: Opioid prescription misuse becomes growing public health concern in underserved areas'

description: The paper contextualizes opioid use disorder as a growing public health concern in medically
  underserved areas of South Texas, implying a structural relationship between healthcare access deficits
  and the opioid epidemic in these communities.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights how geographic maldistribution of healthcare resources
    creates structural vulnerability to opioid misuse. Rather than attributing opioid misuse to individual
    moral failings, this framing recognizes that limited access to appropriate pain management, mental
    health services, and early intervention creates conditions where opioid misuse can proliferate. The
    decision to implement the ECHO program in these areas acknowledges this structural etiology. Equity
    implications: Border communities and rural areas in South Texas face intersecting disadvantages including
    poverty, limited insurance coverage, and language barriers that compound healthcare access problems.'
