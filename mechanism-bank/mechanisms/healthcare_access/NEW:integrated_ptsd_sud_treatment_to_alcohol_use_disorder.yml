- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems provide integrated treatment addressing both PTSD and SUD simultaneously'

  between conditions'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience reductions in alcohol use severity compared to standard treatment approaches'

description: Integrated trauma-focused psychotherapy targeting both PTSD and SUD simultaneously demonstrated
  superiority over treatment as usual for alcohol use severity. The study used causally moderated comparative
  effectiveness methodology to identify that veterans particularly benefit from this integrated approach.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding has structural implications for healthcare system design. Traditional
    treatment systems often separate mental health and substance use services, creating barriers for patients
    with co-occurring conditions. The study supports structural changes toward integrated care models.
    Veterans may benefit more due to VA system integration and familiarity with addressing trauma. Equity
    implications include the need to extend integrated care models beyond VA systems to civilian healthcare
    settings where such integration is less common.
