mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community pharmacy-based model expands geographic and temporal access to injectable opioid
  agonist treatment (iOAT)'
- 'Step 2: Flexible dosing times and co-location with other pharmacy services reduces structural barriers
  to treatment engagement'
- 'Step 3: Regular supervised injection of prescribed opioids satisfies opioid dependence without requiring
  illicit drug acquisition'
- 'Step 4: Participants report 76% reduction in illicit opioid use and 45% reduction in other illicit
  substance use'

description: Community pharmacy-based injectable opioid agonist treatment provides a novel, lower-barrier
  model for delivering evidence-based OUD treatment, resulting in substantial self-reported reductions
  in illicit opioid use among individuals who inject opioids and have not responded to oral treatment
  options.

  description: Program specifically targets individuals who have not responded to or do not prefer oral
    OAT, suggesting greater benefit for treatment-resistant populations

  strength: moderate
  description: Most participants had multiple previous overdoses, indicating high-risk population with
    greater potential for harm reduction benefit
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to OUD treatment including limited
    treatment availability, rigid dosing schedules, and fragmented healthcare services. By embedding iOAT
    in community pharmacies, the model reduces geographic and temporal access barriers that disproportionately
    affect marginalized populations. The approach avoids individual blame by recognizing that treatment
    non-response to oral OAT reflects medication-patient mismatch rather than personal failure.
