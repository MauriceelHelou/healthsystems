mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief interventions in healthcare settings identify individuals with substance use issues who
  may not be engaged in specialized treatment'
- 'Step 2: Intervention increases awareness of personal substance use severity and available treatment
  options'
- 'Step 3: Motivational techniques enhance readiness for change and treatment-seeking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Referral pathways and linkages facilitate entry into formal substance use treatment programs'
- 'Step 5: Increased utilization of specialized substance use treatment services'

  equity_implications: This finding has important structural implications. Treatment utilization depends
    on multiple structural factors including treatment availability, insurance coverage, geographic access,
    and social support. The strong effect on treatment utilization suggests that brief interventions can
    serve as a critical bridge between general healthcare and specialized treatment systems. For populations
    facing structural barriers to seeking treatment directly, healthcare-based brief interventions may
    provide an essential pathway to care.
