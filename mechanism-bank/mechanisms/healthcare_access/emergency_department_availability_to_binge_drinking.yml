- 'Step 1: Emergency department visits provide a ''teachable moment'' for individuals with alcohol-related
  presentations'
- 'Step 2: ED-based screening identifies hazardous and harmful drinkers during acute care episodes'
- 'Step 3: Brief interventions delivered in ED settings reduce subsequent alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Even single-session brief interventions can initiate behavior change'
- 'Step 5: Reduced binge drinking frequency following ED-based intervention'

description: Emergency department availability creates an additional structural access point for alcohol
  screening and brief intervention, particularly for populations who may not regularly access primary
  care. ED-based brief interventions reduce drinking days per week and overall consumption patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how emergency healthcare infrastructure can serve as
    a safety net intervention point for alcohol-related harm reduction. However, populations relying primarily
    on ED care (often due to lack of primary care access) may receive less consistent follow-up. Rural
    hospital closures and ED deserts may disproportionately affect communities' access to this intervention
    pathway, creating structural inequities in alcohol harm reduction opportunities.
