- 'Step 1: Insufficient clinician knowledge about AUD creates functional shortage of treatment providers'
- 'Step 2: Clinician discomfort leads to avoidance of AUD assessment and treatment in hepatology settings'
- 'Step 3: Patients with cirrhosis face barriers accessing AUD treatment from their existing providers'
- 'Step 4: De facto treatment capacity shortage despite potential provider availability'

description: The paper establishes that insufficient clinician knowledge and comfort managing AUD impacts
  access to treatment for patients with cirrhosis. This creates a structural barrier where patients cannot
  access needed AUD treatment through their hepatology providers.

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural root cause of treatment access disparities
    - the failure of medical education systems to adequately prepare hepatology and primary care clinicians
    to manage AUD. This is a system-level failure that creates inequitable access to evidence-based treatment,
    particularly affecting populations with high rates of AUD-related liver disease.
