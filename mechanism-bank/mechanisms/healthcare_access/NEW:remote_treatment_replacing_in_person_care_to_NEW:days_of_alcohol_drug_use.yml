mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Remote/digital interventions partially or fully replace traditional in-person alcohol/drug
  treatment'
- 'Step 2: Treatment accessibility maintained despite reduced in-person contact'
- 'Step 3: Some therapeutic elements may be less effective without face-to-face interaction'
- 'Step 4: Evidence base for replacement model is smaller and shows greater uncertainty'
- 'Step 5: Effects on days of substance use remain unclear due to limited evidence'

description: Remote interventions that replace or partially replace in-person alcohol/drug treatment show
  less conclusive evidence for reducing days of substance use compared to supplemental models. The smaller
  evidence base and greater uncertainty suggest caution in relying solely on remote modalities.

  description: Partial vs. full replacement of in-person care may yield different outcomes; evidence uncertain
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While remote-only treatment could address access barriers for underserved populations,
    the uncertain evidence suggests potential quality-equity tradeoffs. Populations with limited access
    to in-person care should not receive inferior treatment simply due to structural barriers. Policy
    should prioritize hybrid models where possible.
