mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adolescents presenting to emergency departments for any reason are offered
  a brief self-completed alcohol screening questionnaire (AUDIT-C)'
- 'Step 2: The AUDIT-C screening tool with an optimal cut-off point of ≥3 effectively
  identifies adolescents who are at risk of alcohol-related problems'
- 'Step 3: ED-based screening captures a population with high prevalence of at-risk
  alcohol consumption (15% prevalence), including those not accessing other healthcare
  settings'
- 'Step 4: Systematic screening in EDs enables identification of at-risk drinking
  patterns before progression to more severe alcohol use disorders'

description: Emergency department-based screening using the AUDIT-C questionnaire
  effectively identifies at-risk alcohol use among adolescents. A prevalence study
  of 5,376 adolescents (mean age 13.0 years) found that 15% met criteria for at-risk
  alcohol consumption using an AUDIT-C cut-off of ≥3. The ED setting provides a unique
  opportunity to reach adolescents who may not be engaged with other healthcare services,
  enabling early identification of risky drinking patterns.
