category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Methamphetamine cessation produces characteristic withdrawal syndrome with psychological and
  physical symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Access to effective pharmacotherapy could reduce withdrawal symptom burden including craving'
- 'Step 3: Current evidence shows no medication improves withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo'
- 'Step 4: Absence of effective treatments means patients must endure full withdrawal severity without
  pharmacological support'
- 'Step 5: This structural treatment gap perpetuates barriers to successful recovery from methamphetamine
  use disorder'

description: The meta-analysis found no medications improved withdrawal symptoms or craving compared to
  placebo. The evidence base is severely limited by small sample sizes (mean n=27) and low quality of
  evidence on GRADE assessments. This represents a structural failure in clinical research investment
  for stimulant use disorders, leaving patients without evidence-based pharmacological options for managing
  withdrawal.

  equity_implications: The lack of effective pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine withdrawal reflects systemic
    underinvestment in stimulant use disorder research compared to opioid use disorder. This creates a
    two-tiered treatment system where patients with OUD have access to multiple FDA-approved medications
    while those with stimulant use disorder have none. The call for 'better powered, high-quality trials'
    highlights the need for structural investment in research infrastructure. The absence of safety profile
    data due to poor reporting also reflects inadequate regulatory and research standards for this population.
