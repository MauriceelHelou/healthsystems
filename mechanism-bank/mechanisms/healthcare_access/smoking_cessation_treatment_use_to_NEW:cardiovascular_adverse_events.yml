description: The protocol includes cardiovascular safety as a secondary outcome. The review will assess
  whether smoking cessation medicines carry differential cardiovascular risks, informing both individual
  prescribing and population-level policy.

  equity_implications: Cardiovascular risk assessment requires adequate healthcare system capacity for
    screening and monitoring. Populations with limited access to preventive care may face greater risks
    from both continued smoking and inadequately monitored cessation attempts.
