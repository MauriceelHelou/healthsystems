direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Educational session specifically covers prescribing pharmacotherapy for AUD'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians learn about FDA-approved medications for AUD treatment in context of liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Improved knowledge increases comfort with prescribing pharmacological treatments'
- 'Step 4: However, intention to actually prescribe did not significantly change post-intervention'

description: While the educational intervention improved clinician comfort with prescribing pharmacotherapy
  for AUD, it did not significantly change intention to prescribe. This suggests additional structural
  barriers beyond knowledge and comfort that prevent treatment provision.

  equity_implications: This finding highlights that education alone is insufficient to change practice
    when structural barriers remain. The gap between improved comfort and unchanged prescribing intention
    points to system-level factors (formulary restrictions, time constraints, referral patterns, institutional
    culture) that must be addressed alongside education. This is a key insight for health equity - structural
    interventions at multiple levels are needed.
