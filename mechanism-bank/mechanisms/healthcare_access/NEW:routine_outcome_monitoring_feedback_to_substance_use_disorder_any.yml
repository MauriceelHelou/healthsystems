- 'Step 1: ROM systems track substance use outcomes during AOD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Feedback identifies clients who are off-track in their recovery trajectory'
- 'Step 3: Clinicians can intensify or modify treatment for off-track clients based on objective data'
- 'Step 4: Early intervention for deteriorating clients prevents treatment failure'
- 'Step 5: Substance use outcomes improve, particularly among off-track clients'

description: ROM feedback may reduce substance use outcomes in AOD treatment, though evidence is limited.
  Only one of six high-quality studies found significant reductions in substance use, specifically among
  off-track clients.

  description: Only 1 of 6 good/fair quality studies found significant substance use reductions, and this
    effect was limited to off-track clients
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The limited evidence for substance use outcomes highlights the complexity of addiction
    treatment and the need for systems-level quality improvement. The finding that off-track clients benefit
    most suggests ROM can help address healthcare system gaps in identifying and responding to clients
    at risk of treatment failure.
