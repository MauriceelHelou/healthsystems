  description: Adjunctive pharmacotherapy selection impacts ICU length of stay in severe AWS
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Severe alcohol withdrawal requiring ICU care represents a failure of upstream prevention,
    including lack of accessible alcohol use disorder treatment, harm reduction services, and community-based
    withdrawal management. Populations with limited access to outpatient AUD treatment are more likely
    to present in severe withdrawal crisis. The healthcare costs of ICU stays for severe AWS disproportionately
    burden safety-net hospitals serving marginalized communities.
