direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher prison incarceration rates increase the population exposed to congregate
  prison settings where risk factors for HCV transmission are concentrated'
- 'Step 2: Prison environments have elevated prevalence of injection drug use, with
  approximately 20% of German prisoners using heroin, creating conditions for bloodborne
  pathogen transmission'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate harm reduction programs (needle exchange programs discontinued
  in most facilities) and limited access to prevention services allow HCV transmission
  to continue within prisons'
- 'Step 4: Deficient provision of HCV treatment to incarcerated persons allows infected
  individuals to remain untreated and potentially transmit infection'
- 'Step 5: Upon release, formerly incarcerated individuals with untreated HCV return
  to communities, increasing overall population prevalence (prisoners are 48-69 times
  more likely to have HCV than general population)'

description: Prison incarceration is positively associated with hepatitis C prevalence
  through multiple interconnected pathways. Incarcerated populations have dramatically
  elevated HCV prevalence (48-69 times higher than general population in Germany)
  due to concentration of high-risk behaviors including injection drug use, inadequate
  harm reduction measures, and deficient treatment provision within penal facilities.
  The discontinuation of needle exchange programs in most prisons removes a key preventive
  intervention, while limited healthcare access prevents treatment of existing infections.
