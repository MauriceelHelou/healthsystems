- 'Step 1: Health education programs and prenatal care provide information about alcohol''s harmful effects
  on fetal development'
- 'Step 2: Women who access prenatal care receive counseling about alcohol risks'
- 'Step 3: Knowledge acquisition leads to informed decision-making about alcohol avoidance'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness results in reduced alcohol consumption during pregnancy'

  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural factors like health education systems,
    prenatal care accessibility, and public health messaging infrastructure determine whether pregnant
    women receive critical information. The burden of knowledge gaps falls disproportionately on women
    with limited healthcare access, reflecting structural inequities in health education delivery.
