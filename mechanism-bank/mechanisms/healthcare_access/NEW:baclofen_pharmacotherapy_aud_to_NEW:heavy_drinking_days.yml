description: Baclofen up to 50-60 mg/day did not significantly affect heavy drinking days in this meta-analysis,
  indicating that the medication's benefits may be specific to abstinence maintenance and craving reduction
  rather than harm reduction in ongoing drinkers.

  equity_implications: This null finding has implications for treatment guidelines and healthcare policy.
    Different AUD treatment goals (abstinence vs. harm reduction) may require different pharmacological
    approaches. Healthcare systems should ensure access to multiple evidence-based options to address
    diverse patient needs and treatment goals.
