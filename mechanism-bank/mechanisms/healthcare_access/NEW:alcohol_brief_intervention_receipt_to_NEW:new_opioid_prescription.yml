- 'Step 1: Primary care screening identifies patients with unhealthy alcohol use via AUDIT-C'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention delivered during primary care visit addresses alcohol use and related health
  behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Intervention may reduce pain-related alcohol use and improve engagement with non-opioid pain
  management'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare providers may exercise more caution in prescribing opioids to patients who have
  received alcohol counseling'
- 'Step 5: Reduced likelihood of new opioid prescription initiation'

description: Veterans with positive AUDIT-C screen results who did NOT receive an alcohol-related brief
  intervention had 10% higher odds of receiving a new opioid prescription in the following year compared
  to those who received the intervention. This suggests the brief intervention has a protective effect
  against new opioid prescribing.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system delivery of preventive interventions
    (brief interventions for alcohol) can interrupt downstream cascades of opioid-related outcomes. The
    VA system's routine screening and intervention protocol represents a structural approach to addressing
    polysubstance risk. Equity implications include ensuring all positive screens receive intervention
    regardless of patient demographics or provider characteristics.
