- 'Step 1: Criminal justice-involved individuals with OUD receive extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX)
  as medication for opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 2: XR-NTX reduces opioid use through opioid receptor antagonism but does not address underlying
  social determinants'
- 'Step 3: Structural factors including stigma, lack of employment, housing instability, and criminal
  record barriers persist despite medication treatment'
- 'Step 4: These unaddressed structural determinants continue to drive criminal justice involvement regardless
  of medication status'
- 'Step 5: No significant difference in arrest incidence between XR-NTX and treatment as usual groups'

description: This randomized trial found no significant difference in arrest incidence between criminal
  justice-involved individuals with OUD who received extended-release naltrexone (47.6%) versus treatment
  as usual (42.5%). Despite XR-NTX's efficacy in reducing opioid use, it alone was insufficient to reduce
  criminal recidivism, highlighting that medication treatment without addressing structural determinants
  (employment, housing, stigma, criminal record barriers) does not reduce justice involvement.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This study demonstrates that biomedical interventions alone (medication for OUD)
    are insufficient to address complex social outcomes like criminal recidivism. The finding that XR-NTX
    reduces opioid use but not arrests points to the critical role of structural determinants beyond substance
    use in driving criminal justice involvement. The paper notes that stigma and concerns about diversion
    limit treatment access in CJS populations, reflecting systemic barriers. Addressing recidivism requires
    comprehensive reentry support including housing, employment, and addressing the collateral consequences
    of criminal records - not just medication.
