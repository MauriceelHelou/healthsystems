mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structured cognitive training programs are provided to older adults with mild cognitive impairment
  (MCI) or mild dementia'
- 'Step 2: Training exercises target neural pathways involved in attention processing'
- 'Step 3: Repeated practice strengthens cognitive reserves and compensatory neural mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Overall attention function improves, reducing deficits associated with cognitive decline'

description: Cognitive training interventions improve overall attention function in older adults with
  mild cognitive impairment, with a small to moderate effect size (Hedges' g = 0.41). This has implications
  for maintaining functional independence and reducing accident risk.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to cognitive training programs is a structural determinant - availability
    depends on healthcare system resources, insurance coverage, and geographic access to specialized services.
    Older adults in under-resourced communities may lack access to these evidence-based interventions,
    creating inequities in cognitive health outcomes.
