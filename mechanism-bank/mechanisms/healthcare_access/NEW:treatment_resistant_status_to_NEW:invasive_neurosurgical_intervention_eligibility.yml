mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients fail multiple conventional AUD treatments (medications, behavioral therapies)'
- 'Step 2: Treatment resistance designation makes patients eligible for experimental interventions'
- 'Step 3: Inpatient status provides controlled environment for surgical intervention and monitoring'
- 'Step 4: DBS offered as last-resort option after exhausting standard treatment approaches'

description: The study enrolled inpatients with treatment-resistant AUD, indicating that DBS is positioned
  as an intervention for those who have not responded to conventional treatments. This creates a pathway
  where treatment failure paradoxically becomes a criterion for accessing advanced interventions.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 12
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'The concept of ''treatment resistance'' in AUD is partly constructed by structural
    factors: inadequate treatment duration, lack of integrated care, insurance limitations on treatment
    episodes, and absence of wrap-around services (housing, employment support) that are necessary for
    recovery. Many patients labeled ''treatment-resistant'' may actually be experiencing ''system-resistant''
    recovery due to structural barriers. The availability of DBS only at specialized centers further stratifies
    access based on geography and socioeconomic status.'
