mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrating leprosy care into general health services removes visible segregation of affected
  patients'
- 'Step 2: Treatment in mainstream facilities normalizes leprosy as a routine health condition'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare workers trained in integrated settings develop less stigmatizing attitudes'
- 'Step 4: Reduced institutional segregation decreases community perception of leprosy as requiring isolation'

description: Integration of leprosy services within the general health system reduces stigma by normalizing
  treatment and eliminating institutional structures that reinforce segregation and othering of affected
  persons.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Evidence from Nepal, India, and Indonesia; health system structures vary significantly
    across endemic regions.

  strength: moderate
  description: Integration effectiveness depends on general health system capacity to absorb specialized
    services while maintaining quality
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism targets health system structures that institutionalize stigma through
    segregated care. Addresses how healthcare delivery organization itself can perpetuate discrimination,
    requiring structural rather than attitudinal interventions.
