mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief interventions (1-2 sessions) delivered primarily in-person reach non-treatment-seeking
  emerging adults'
- 'Step 2: Motivational interviewing techniques enhance intrinsic motivation for behavior change'
- 'Step 3: Single-session format reduces barriers to engagement (time, cost, stigma)'
- 'Step 4: Targeted cannabis-specific content addresses use patterns and consequences'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in symptoms of cannabis use disorder at 1-3 months post-intervention'

description: Brief interventions (1-2 sessions) focusing exclusively on cannabis use among non-treatment-seeking
  emerging adults (ages 15-30) result in small but significant reductions in cannabis use disorder symptoms
  at 1-3 months post-intervention compared to passive controls.

    compared to treatment-seeking populations

  description: Most interventions were motivational, single sessions, and delivered in person - format
    consistency may affect generalizability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects healthcare system accessibility - brief interventions reduce
    structural barriers to care (time, multiple appointments, cost) for emerging adults who may not otherwise
    seek treatment. The finding that effects occur in non-treatment-seeking populations highlights how
    lowering structural barriers to intervention access can reach underserved populations. However, evidence
    quality is low, and few studies addressed concurrent psychiatric conditions, which may reflect healthcare
    system fragmentation.
