direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AOD services designed with narrow biomedical focus fail to address social
  determinants and holistic wellbeing needs of Indigenous Australians'
- 'Step 2: Single-issue treatment approaches ignore interconnected factors including
  historical trauma, social connection, family systems, and spiritual wellbeing central
  to Indigenous health'
- 'Step 3: Fragmented services create barriers to comprehensive care, requiring Indigenous
  peoples to navigate multiple disconnected systems'
- 'Step 4: Failure to address holistic needs results in incomplete treatment, higher
  relapse rates, and poorer long-term substance use outcomes'
