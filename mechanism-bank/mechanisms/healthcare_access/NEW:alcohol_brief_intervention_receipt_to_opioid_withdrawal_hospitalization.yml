mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systematic alcohol screening in primary care identifies patients at elevated polysubstance
  risk'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention creates opportunity for health behavior discussion and referral to additional
  services'
- 'Step 3: Reduced opioid prescribing and OUD incidence among those receiving intervention'
- 'Step 4: Lower overall opioid exposure reduces risk of opioid-related medical emergencies'
- 'Step 5: Decreased opioid-related hospitalizations including overdose and withdrawal complications'

description: Veterans with positive AUDIT-C screens who did NOT receive an alcohol-related brief intervention
  showed 19% higher odds of opioid-related hospitalization, though this finding was not statistically
  significant (95% CI included 1.0). The direction of effect is consistent with the cascade model from
  prescriptions through OUD to hospitalizations.

  equity_implications: The cascade from unhealthy alcohol use through opioid prescription to hospitalization
    reflects how healthcare system contact points can either perpetuate or interrupt cycles of substance-related
    harm. The VA's systematic screening approach represents a structural intervention that, when fully
    implemented, may reduce downstream acute care utilization and associated costs. The non-significant
    finding for hospitalization may reflect lower statistical power due to rare outcome (0.8% incidence).
