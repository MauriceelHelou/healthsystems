description: The cost analysis reveals that labor investment is the primary driver of MOUD implementation
  costs. Pre-implementation activities averaged $1,031 per site while implementation activities averaged
  $17,816 per site. At approximately $48 per patient with OUD, the intervention may be affordable depending
  on payer budget constraints, suggesting that resource allocation decisions at the system level are key
  determinants of treatment access expansion.

    wages in the VHA system compared to general labor market estimates.

  description: Implementation activities ($17,816) cost substantially more than pre-implementation activities
    ($1,031), indicating that the active implementation phase drives most costs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare financing and workforce allocation structures
    determine whether evidence-based OUD treatments reach patients. The opioid epidemic has disproportionately
    affected rural and economically disadvantaged communities where healthcare resources are limited.
    By quantifying implementation costs, this research provides actionable information for health system
    decision makers to address structural barriers to MOUD access. The finding that costs are relatively
    modest ($48 per patient) compared to the burden of untreated OUD suggests that resource allocation
    decisions, not treatment efficacy, are the limiting factor in addressing the epidemic.
