mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital CBT platforms remove geographic and transportation barriers to evidence-based AUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Online delivery allows flexible scheduling, reducing conflicts with work and caregiving responsibilities'
- 'Step 3: Reduced stigma of accessing treatment privately at home increases treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: CBT techniques (cognitive restructuring, coping skills) are delivered to address maladaptive
  drinking patterns'
- 'Step 5: Sustained engagement with CBT leads to reduction in alcohol consumption and AUD symptoms'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 RCTs evaluated the comparative effectiveness
  of digital versus face-to-face CBT for adults with alcohol use disorder. Digital CBT has gained prominence
  due to access barriers and user preferences, offering a structural solution to treatment access disparities.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to AUD treatment including geographic
    isolation, transportation limitations, work schedule conflicts, and stigma. Digital CBT represents
    a policy-amenable intervention that can reduce inequities in treatment access. However, effectiveness
    may be limited by digital divide issues affecting low-income populations and rural communities with
    poor broadband infrastructure. Equity implications include both potential to reach underserved populations
    and risk of excluding those without digital access.
