- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates barriers to accessing specialized cardiac care
  facilities that perform alcohol septal ablation (ASA)'
- 'Step 2: Systemic inequities in referral patterns and healthcare system navigation
  reduce Black patients'' access to advanced interventional cardiology services'
- 'Step 3: Implicit bias and discrimination in clinical decision-making lead to differential
  treatment recommendations for Black versus White patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy'
- 'Step 4: Geographic segregation concentrates Black patients in areas with fewer
  tertiary care centers offering advanced procedures like ASA'
