  description: Effects may be stronger in settings with greater shortages of professional mental health
    providers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Depression burden is higher in low-resource settings partly due to structural inequities
    in healthcare access. This intervention addresses the structural determinant of healthcare workforce
    distribution, which creates systematic disparities in mental health care availability between high-income
    and low/middle-income countries.
