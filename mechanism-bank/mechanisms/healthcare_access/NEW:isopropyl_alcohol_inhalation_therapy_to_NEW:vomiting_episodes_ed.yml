description: Only one study assessed vomiting as a secondary outcome and did not find a significant difference
  between IPA intervention and control groups for vomiting episodes during ED stay. This suggests IPA
  may be more effective for nausea symptom relief than prevention of vomiting.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This null finding is important for understanding the limitations of IPA as an ED
    intervention. While nausea is reduced, vomiting prevention may require different or additional interventions.
    From an equity perspective, understanding what IPA can and cannot effectively treat helps inform appropriate
    resource allocation in emergency settings serving diverse populations.
