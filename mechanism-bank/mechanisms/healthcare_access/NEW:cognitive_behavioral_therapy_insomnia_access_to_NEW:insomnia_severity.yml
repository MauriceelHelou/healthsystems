direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with alcohol use disorder frequently experience comorbid insomnia as a prevalent condition'
- 'Step 2: Access to CBT-I provides structured cognitive and behavioral interventions targeting sleep
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: CBT-I addresses maladaptive sleep behaviors and cognitions that perpetuate insomnia'
- 'Step 4: Improved sleep architecture and reduced insomnia severity result from treatment'
- 'Step 5: Effects are maintained at 1-3 month and 6-month follow-up periods'

description: CBT-I produces large and sustained reductions in insomnia severity among patients across
  the spectrum of alcohol use disorder, with effects maintained through 6-month follow-up. This represents
  a non-pharmacological intervention that addresses a key comorbidity in AUD populations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of healthcare system capacity to provide
    evidence-based behavioral treatments for sleep disorders in AUD populations. Structural barriers to
    CBT-I access (availability of trained providers, insurance coverage, integration into AUD treatment
    settings) create inequities in who can benefit from this effective intervention. The finding supports
    wide implementation in AUD prevention and treatment settings, which requires structural investment
    in treatment infrastructure.
