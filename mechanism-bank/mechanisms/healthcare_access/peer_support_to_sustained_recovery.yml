  - 'Step 3: Regular peer contact provides accountability, encouragement, and early identification of relapse warning signs'
  - 'Step 4: Peer-led recovery activities create substance-free social connections and purposeful engagement replacing drinking relationships'
  - 'Step 5: Sustained peer support engagement increases treatment retention, reduces relapse, and promotes long-term recovery maintenance'

  equity_implications: While peer support is evidence-based and cost-effective, systematic barriers limit access. Most states don't reimburse peer services through Medicaid, relegating them to grant-funded pilots. Professional hierarchies devalue peer expertise compared to clinical credentials. Peer specialists, disproportionately from marginalized communities, face low wages and poor working conditions. The paradox is that peer support works precisely because peers share lived experience of structural conditions generating addiction—yet these same structures undervalue and underpay peer work. Limited peer support access particularly harms communities of color and low-income populations who benefit most from culturally concordant peer services. Addressing this requires: universal Medicaid peer service coverage, living wages for peer specialists, career ladders, integration into all treatment settings, and recognizing lived experience as valuable expertise deserving compensation and respect.
assumptions:
  - 'Peer support includes both formal certified peer specialists and informal mutual aid participation'
  - 'Mechanism operates through multiple pathways: social support, practical assistance, modeling, hope'
  - 'Voluntary utilization rather than coerced participation'
limitations:
  - 'Individual variation in response to peer support based on preferences and readiness'
  - 'Quality and training of peer services varies widely across programs'
  - 'Peer support complements but does not replace clinical treatment for severe AUD'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Peer support availability and reimbursement vary dramatically by state Medicaid policies and local infrastructure
  relevant_geographies:
    - 'States with Medicaid peer support benefits (e.g., Georgia, Arizona) show broader access'
    - 'Urban areas have more formal peer support organizations and training programs'
    - 'Rural areas rely heavily on volunteer mutual aid with limited professional peer services'
    - 'Treatment systems that integrate peers show better geographic coverage of support services'
