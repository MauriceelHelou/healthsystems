- 'Step 1: Pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin combination therapy is administered
  for acute hepatitis C infection treatment'
- 'Step 2: The combination of pegylated interferon-alpha (an immunomodulator) and
  ribavirin (a nucleoside analogue) produces additive or synergistic side effects
  including hematologic toxicity, neuropsychiatric effects, and systemic inflammatory
  responses'
- 'Step 3: The dual-drug regimen increases the rate of serious adverse events compared
  to pegylated interferon-alpha monotherapy, with rate ratio of 2.74 (95% CI 1.40-5.33)'

description: Pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin combination therapy for acute
  hepatitis C infection is associated with a significantly higher rate of serious
  adverse events compared to pegylated interferon-alpha monotherapy. This Cochrane
  systematic review of 2 randomized controlled trials (237 participants) found that
  the combination therapy increased serious adverse events with a rate ratio of 2.74
  (95% CI 1.40-5.33). The evidence was rated as very low quality due to high risk
  of bias in the included trials.
