description: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a shift to virtual care for AUD/PAU treatment services.
  However, the abstract explicitly notes that 'accessibility was not universal,' indicating structural
  barriers to telehealth access that differentially affect certain populations.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the digital divide creates inequitable access to
    care during public health emergencies. The shift to virtual care, while necessary, may have exacerbated
    existing inequities for populations without reliable internet, digital devices, or digital literacy
    skills. This is a structural barrier rooted in infrastructure and economic inequities.
