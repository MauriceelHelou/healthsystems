mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-resourced primary care clinics in underserved areas have limited workforce capacity for
  implementing screening programs'
- 'Step 2: Without systematic SBIRT implementation, unhealthy alcohol use goes undetected in routine primary
  care visits'
- 'Step 3: Lack of early identification means patients miss opportunities for brief intervention when
  alcohol problems are developing'
- 'Step 4: Untreated unhealthy alcohol use progresses to alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 5: Treatment gaps perpetuate cycles of AUD-related health consequences and healthcare utilization'

description: Structural healthcare access barriers in low-resourced primary care settings contribute to
  persistently low SBIRT and MAUD implementation rates, leaving unhealthy alcohol use undetected and untreated
  in populations served by these clinics.

  description: 27% attrition (18 of 66 clinics did not complete) suggests that most resource-constrained

  description: Access to practice facilitation, expert consultation, and peer learning partially mitigates
    resource constraints, as demonstrated by intervention effectiveness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism explicitly traces alcohol-related health inequities to structural
    healthcare system deficits rather than individual patient characteristics. Low-resourced clinics serving
    diverse populations face compounding structural disadvantages: workforce shortages, limited training
    infrastructure, inadequate health IT, and competing clinical demands. These structural factors create
    systematic gaps in alcohol screening and treatment that disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
    The study''s focus on providing external implementation support acknowledges that clinic-level behavior
    change requires addressing structural resource constraints.'
