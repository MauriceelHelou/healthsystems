mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: System-wide implementation of alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment
  (SBIRT) in primary care settings identifies patients with unhealthy alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention provides counseling and education about alcohol-related health risks within
  routine care visits'
- 'Step 3: Patients with hypertension who receive brief intervention reduce their drinks per drinking
  day and drinks per week'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption leads to decreased heavy drinking episodes'

description: Among patients with hypertension who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use, those who
  received alcohol brief intervention had a modest but significant additional reduction of 0.06 drinks
  per drinking day compared to those who did not receive the intervention.

    suggesting condition-specific responsiveness to brief intervention
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the structural importance of healthcare system-level
    implementation of alcohol screening and intervention. The system-wide SBIRT program represents a structural
    approach that embeds intervention into routine care rather than relying on individual initiative.
    The differential effects by condition type (hypertension vs. diabetes) point to the need for tailored
    structural approaches across diverse patient populations.
