description: People receiving OAT face elevated cardiovascular risk; integrating exercise programs into
  OAT may help reduce health disparities by improving cardiovascular fitness through accessible, clinic-based
  interventions.

    attendance limits impact
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural inequity of elevated cardiovascular risk
    in OAT populations by proposing system-level integration of exercise into existing healthcare infrastructure.
    It recognizes that individual-level exercise recommendations are insufficient without structural support
    systems that make participation accessible and feasible for this marginalized population.
