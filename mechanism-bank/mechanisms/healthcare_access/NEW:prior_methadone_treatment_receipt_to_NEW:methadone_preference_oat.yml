direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior exposure to methadone treatment creates familiarity with medication effects and dosing
  protocols'
- 'Step 2: Positive treatment experiences reinforce preference for known medication'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare system structures that limit initial OAT options constrain future preferences'
- 'Step 4: Patient preference for methadone perpetuated through treatment history shapes future treatment-seeking
  behavior'

description: Prior receipt of methadone treatment was the strongest independent correlate of preferring
  methadone over buprenorphine for opioid agonist therapy, with over 6-fold increased odds. This reflects
  how initial healthcare system treatment pathways shape long-term patient preferences.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system structures that determine initial
    OAT access shape patient preferences long-term. If methadone is more accessible or more commonly prescribed
    initially, it creates path dependency in treatment preferences. The study emphasizes need for expanded
    access to diverse OAT options to align treatment with patient preferences rather than system constraints.
