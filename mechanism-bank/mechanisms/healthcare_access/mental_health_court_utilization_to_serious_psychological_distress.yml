structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how structural barriers to mental healthcare for justice-involved
    individuals can be addressed through court-based diversion programs. The high prevalence of depression
    (91%) reflects the mental health burden among incarcerated populations, which is often undertreated
    in correctional settings. By creating structural pathways to care outside incarceration, mental health
    courts address systemic failures in providing adequate mental healthcare to justice-involved populations.
