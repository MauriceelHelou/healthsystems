mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Harm reduction housing provides stable environment for consistent harm reduction service access'
- 'Step 2: On-site or easily accessible syringe exchange reduces needle sharing and injection-related
  HIV transmission risk'
- 'Step 3: Housing stability enables regular HIV testing and early diagnosis'
- 'Step 4: Stable housing facilitates antiretroviral therapy initiation and adherence, reducing community
  viral load'

description: Harm reduction housing models that integrate services for people who use drugs may reduce
  HIV risk through improved access to sterile injection equipment, HIV testing, and treatment adherence
  support.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 106
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study focused on Boston's Mass and Cass area which has experienced concentrated HIV
    risk among people who inject drugs
moderators:
- name: harm_reduction_service_availability
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The study specifically inventories harm reduction services to measure exposure, indicating
    service availability is key moderator
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that HIV risk among people who inject drugs is driven
    by structural factors including homelessness, criminalization, and lack of harm reduction services
    rather than individual behavior choices.
