mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Disadvantaged adolescents in low SES or geographically remote areas face barriers to traditional
  health services including stigma, access, and affordability'
- 'Step 2: eHealth interventions provide accessible, affordable, and stigma-reducing delivery of health
  promotion content'
- 'Step 3: Digital platforms deliver tailored dietary education and behavioral prompts regardless of geographic
  location'
- 'Step 4: Increased exposure to nutrition information leads to improved fruit and vegetable intake and
  reduced consumption of nutrient-poor foods'

description: eHealth interventions can overcome structural barriers to health services (stigma, access,
  affordability) faced by disadvantaged adolescents, resulting in significant improvements in dietary
  behaviors including increased fruit and vegetable intake, increased percentage energy from nutrient-rich
  foods, and decreased sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and nutrient-poor food intake

  variation_notes: Study specifically targeted geographically remote populations (33% of participants),
    suggesting effects may be particularly relevant for populations with limited access to in-person health
    services

  description: Remote populations benefit more from digital delivery due to lack of local health services
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural inequities in healthcare access. Rather than
    blaming adolescents for poor diet, it recognizes that social, structural, and economic barriers uniquely
    affect low SES and geographically remote youth. eHealth represents a policy-amenable intervention
    that can reduce disparities in health service access. The equity implication is that digital health
    delivery can democratize access to prevention services.
