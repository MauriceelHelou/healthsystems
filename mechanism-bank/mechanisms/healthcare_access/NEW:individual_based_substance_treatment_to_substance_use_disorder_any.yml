- 'Step 1: Individual-based treatment (IBT) focuses on the person with substance use disorder alone'
- 'Step 2: Patient develops coping skills and motivation for change'
- 'Step 3: Treatment does not directly address relationship dynamics or partner involvement'
- 'Step 4: Recovery depends primarily on individual resources and willpower'
- 'Step 5: Less robust effect on substance use frequency compared to couple-based approaches'

description: When BCT is directly compared to individual-based treatment (IBT), BCT shows superior effectiveness
  in reducing substance use frequency (g=0.23). This suggests that treatment modality structure - specifically
  the inclusion of intimate partners - is an important factor in treatment effectiveness.

  equity_implications: The inferiority of individual-based treatment highlights a structural critique
    of healthcare systems that default to individual-level interventions. Treatment systems that fail
    to offer couple-based options may inadvertently limit recovery outcomes. Access to BCT may be systematically
    limited for marginalized populations, creating treatment inequities.
