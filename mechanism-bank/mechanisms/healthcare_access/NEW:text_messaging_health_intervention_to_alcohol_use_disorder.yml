mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Text messaging interventions provide low-barrier digital access to alcohol reduction support'
- 'Step 2: Regular text-based prompts and information reduce weekly alcohol consumption among harmful
  drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Sustained reduction in alcohol consumption decreases risk of progression to alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Mobile technology enables continuous engagement outside traditional clinical settings'

description: The planned systematic review aims to determine whether text messaging interventions can
  reduce weekly alcohol consumption, a primary outcome measure. Reducing consumption among harmful and
  hazardous drinkers may prevent progression to clinical alcohol use disorder.

    or unrelated health information
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to alcohol treatment access. Traditional
    alcohol interventions often require in-person visits, transportation, time off work, and may carry
    stigma. Text-based interventions can reach individuals who face these structural barriers. The review
    protocol acknowledges that prior reviews focused on web-based interventions, suggesting a gap in evidence
    for more accessible mobile-based approaches. Policy implications include potential for scalable, low-cost
    public health interventions that don't require healthcare system infrastructure.
