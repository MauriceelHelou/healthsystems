mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systematic alcohol screening identifies patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) who may otherwise
  go undetected'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions provide patients with information about their alcohol use and motivate
  behavior change consideration'
- 'Step 3: Clinicians trained in SBIRT recognize indications for medication-assisted treatment for AUD
  (MAUD)'
- 'Step 4: Referral to treatment pathways connect patients with AUD to appropriate pharmacotherapy options'
- 'Step 5: Increased MAUD prescribing addresses the treatment gap for alcohol use disorder in primary
  care settings'

description: SBIRT implementation creates a cascade linking systematic screening to identification of
  AUD, enabling referral to and provision of medication-assisted treatment. The study showed improved
  performance data among clinics able to track outcomes, though barriers to MAUD implementation remained.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 17
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Only subset of completing clinics (n=17) able to produce EHR performance data; data
    infrastructure varies significantly across low-resourced clinic settings
moderators:
- name: data_extraction_capability
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Only clinics with adequate EHR data infrastructure could demonstrate performance improvements;
    this represents structural variation in clinic capacity
- name: expert_consultation_access
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: 19% of clinics accessed expert consultation which may include guidance on MAUD prescribing
    protocols
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Low MAUD utilization in primary care represents a structural treatment gap, not
    individual patient resistance. Barriers include inadequate clinician training, DEA waiver requirements
    (at time of study), stigma within healthcare systems, and lack of integrated treatment pathways. The
    intervention addresses these structural barriers through expert consultation and workflow support.
    Health equity implications are significant as diverse, low-resourced clinics serve populations disproportionately
    affected by alcohol-related harms but with least access to evidence-based treatment.
