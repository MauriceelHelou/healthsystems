direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare policy determines catheter replacement timing'
- 'Step 2: Longer catheter dwell time with clinically-indicated approach may increase vessel irritation
  exposure'
- 'Step 3: Endothelial damage and inflammatory response can lead to thrombophlebitis'
- 'Step 4: No significant difference in thrombophlebitis rates observed between replacement strategies'

description: No clear difference in thrombophlebitis rates between clinically-indicated (317/3590) and
  routine replacement (307/3733) groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.25). When analyzed by device days (32,709
  total), results remained non-significant (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76-1.08)

  equity_implications: This healthcare protocol-level policy affects all hospitalized patients requiring
    IV access. The finding of no difference challenges routine replacement guidelines that create unnecessary
    healthcare utilization and patient burden.
