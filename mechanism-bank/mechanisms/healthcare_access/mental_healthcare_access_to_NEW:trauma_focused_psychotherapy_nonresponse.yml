mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited mental healthcare access delays PTSD treatment initiation'
- 'Step 2: Delayed treatment allows trauma symptoms to become more entrenched and chronic'
- 'Step 3: Chronic PTSD associated with neurobiological changes that reduce treatment responsiveness'
- 'Step 4: Access barriers may force treatment discontinuation before adequate dose received'
- 'Step 5: Inadequate treatment exposure leads to incomplete symptom resolution'

description: Healthcare access barriers influence PTSD treatment outcomes by affecting treatment timing,
  continuity, and completion. The finding that up to half of patients do not respond to trauma-focused
  psychotherapy may partly reflect structural barriers to optimal treatment delivery.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Mental healthcare access varies significantly by geography, with rural areas and underserved
    urban communities having fewer trauma-trained providers

  description: Severe provider shortages in mental health professional shortage areas exacerbate access
    barriers and treatment delays
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Mental healthcare access is structurally determined by insurance coverage, provider
    distribution, transportation infrastructure, and workplace policies allowing time off for treatment.
    Rural and low-income communities face systematic disadvantage in accessing evidence-based PTSD treatment.
    The 50% non-response rate cannot be separated from healthcare system failures in providing adequate,
    accessible, and culturally appropriate care.
