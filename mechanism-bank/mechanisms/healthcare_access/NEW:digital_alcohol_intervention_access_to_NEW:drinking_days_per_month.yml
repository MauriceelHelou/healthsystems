direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital platforms deliver alcohol interventions directly to individuals without requiring healthcare
  appointments'
- 'Step 2: Behavior change techniques including goal setting and problem solving help users plan alcohol-free
  days'
- 'Step 3: Accessibility of digital interventions allows for repeated engagement and reinforcement'
- 'Step 4: Users develop alternative behaviors and coping strategies through behavior substitution techniques'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in number of days per month with any alcohol consumption'

description: Participants engaging with digital alcohol interventions had approximately one fewer drinking
  day per month compared to no intervention controls, demonstrating that accessible digital delivery can
  modify drinking frequency patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Reducing drinking frequency through accessible digital interventions addresses
    the structural barrier of limited availability of alcohol brief interventions in primary care settings.
    This mechanism extends reach to populations who may face systemic barriers to accessing traditional
    healthcare-based alcohol interventions.
