- 'Step 1: Evidence demonstrates that MAUD medications have acceptable safety profiles in cirrhosis patients'
- 'Step 2: Only 3% of serious adverse events (5 of 165) were possibly or probably related to study medications'
- 'Step 3: Safety evidence reduces provider hesitancy to prescribe AUD medications in liver disease patients'
- 'Step 4: Reduced barriers enable greater treatment adoption and access for underserved population'

description: The meta-analysis demonstrates that medications for alcohol use disorder have a good safety
  profile in patients with cirrhosis, with only 3% of serious adverse events possibly or probably related
  to study medications. This safety evidence is critical for overcoming structural barriers to treatment
  adoption, as provider concerns about hepatotoxicity have historically limited prescribing of AUD medications
  in liver disease patients.

  description: Different MAUD medications may have different safety profiles in cirrhosis; baclofen was
    most studied (6 of 8 studies)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding addresses a structural knowledge gap that has perpetuated health inequities.
    Patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have been systematically excluded from AUD treatment
    due to perceived (but often unsubstantiated) safety concerns. The evidence of safety creates an opportunity
    to address structural barriers through updated clinical guidelines, provider education, and policy
    changes that ensure equitable access to effective AUD treatment regardless of liver disease status.
