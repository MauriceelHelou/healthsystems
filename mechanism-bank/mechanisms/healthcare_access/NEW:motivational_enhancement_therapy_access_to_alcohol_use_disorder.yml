direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems provide access to motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for patients with
  comorbid alcohol use disorder and alcohol-related liver disease'
- 'Step 2: MET employs motivational interviewing techniques to enhance intrinsic motivation for behavior
  change'
- 'Step 3: Patients develop increased readiness to change drinking behavior through collaborative, non-confrontational
  therapeutic relationship'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption and improved abstinence rates lead to decreased alcohol use disorder
  severity'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of healthcare system investment in evidence-based
    psychosocial interventions. Access to MET requires trained providers and healthcare infrastructure,
    which may be unequally distributed. The review notes need for translation of evidence into real-world
    settings, suggesting structural barriers to implementation.
