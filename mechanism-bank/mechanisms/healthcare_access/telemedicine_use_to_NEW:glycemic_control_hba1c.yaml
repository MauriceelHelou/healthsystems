direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telemedicine platforms enable remote monitoring of blood glucose levels
  and facilitate more frequent data transmission between patients and healthcare providers'
- 'Step 2: Increased patient-provider communication allows for timely medication dose
  adjustments, individualized assessments, and real-time feedback on glycemic management'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced accessibility to diabetes care, especially via smartphone apps,
  promotes better self-management behaviors and adherence to treatment protocols'
- 'Step 4: Continuous monitoring and skill-building interventions through telemedicine
  lead to modest but significant reductions in HbA1c levels compared to usual care'

description: Telemedicine interventions for Type 1 diabetes management produce modest
  but statistically significant reductions in HbA1c levels compared to usual care.
  Meta-analytic evidence from 58 RCTs demonstrates that remote monitoring, digital
  communication platforms, and telemedicine-enabled care coordination improve glycemic
  control, particularly when incorporating medication adjustments, smartphone-based
  communication, and individualized feedback. The effect is more pronounced in younger
  patients and during shorter intervention periods, suggesting telemedicine may be
  most effective as an adjunct to initiate improved diabetes management.
