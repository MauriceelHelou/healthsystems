mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires intensive care unit admission'
- 'Step 2: Phenobarbital provides GABA-A receptor modulation for patients resistant to benzodiazepines'
- 'Step 3: More effective symptom control may reduce need for prolonged ICU-level monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Trend toward reduced ICU length of stay, though not statistically significant'

description: Phenobarbital treatment shows a trend toward reduced ICU length of stay (mean difference
  -1.17 days) compared to benzodiazepines, but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.07). High
  heterogeneity across studies limits conclusions.

  description: Considerable heterogeneity (I²=77%, P=0.002) indicates substantial variation in effect
    across studies, weakening confidence in pooled estimate
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: ICU capacity is a structural healthcare resource that is often strained, particularly
    in underserved communities. Interventions that reduce ICU utilization for alcohol withdrawal could
    free resources for other critical care needs. However, the high heterogeneity suggests that institutional
    factors, protocols, and patient populations significantly influence outcomes, highlighting the need
    for context-specific implementation strategies.
