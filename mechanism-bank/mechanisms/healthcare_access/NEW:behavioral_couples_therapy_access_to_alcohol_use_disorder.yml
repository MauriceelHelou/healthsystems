description: BCT demonstrates sustained effectiveness in reducing alcohol and drug use frequency, with
  effect sizes increasing from post-treatment (g=0.17) to 12-month follow-up (g=0.32). This suggests the
  relational intervention creates lasting structural changes in the couple's environment that support
  continued recovery.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The durability of BCT effects points to how modifying the immediate social environment
    (intimate relationship) creates sustained structural support for recovery. This contrasts with individual-focused
    treatments that may not address ongoing environmental triggers. Equity implications include differential
    access based on relationship stability and socioeconomic resources for couples therapy.
