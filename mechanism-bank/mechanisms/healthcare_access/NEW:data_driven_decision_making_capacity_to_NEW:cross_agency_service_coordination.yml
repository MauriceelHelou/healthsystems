direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Agencies serving individuals with criminal-legal system involvement lack standardized data
  management systems'
- 'Step 2: Limited capacity to track and share data across agencies (jails, probation/parole, mental health,
  substance use services)'
- 'Step 3: Without data infrastructure, agencies cannot coordinate services effectively for individuals
  with co-occurring needs'
- 'Step 4: Poor coordination leads to fragmented care and gaps in treatment continuity for mental health
  and substance use disorders'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies structural barriers in institutional data infrastructure
    rather than individual-level factors. The lack of data sharing systems between criminal justice and
    healthcare agencies is a systems-level failure that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations
    with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders who are justice-involved. Policy incentives
    and infrastructure investment are needed to address these structural gaps.
