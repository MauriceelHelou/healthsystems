category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare settings offer opportunistic single-session alcohol screening and intervention'
- 'Step 2: Brief focused intervention reduces barriers to participation (time, repeated visits)'
- 'Step 3: Concentrated motivational content maximizes immediate behavioral impact'
- 'Step 4: Lower structural barriers to completion improve intervention reach'
- 'Step 5: Immediate awareness and motivation translate to reduced harmful drinking'

description: Single-session brief interventions demonstrate superior efficacy compared to multiple-session
  interventions for reducing harmful alcohol use, suggesting that concentrated, accessible interventions
  may be more effective in LMIC healthcare contexts.

  description: Multiple sessions (g=-0.03, P=0.85) showed dramatically reduced effectiveness compared
    to single session (g=-0.55, P<0.001)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The paradoxical finding that single sessions outperform multiple sessions likely
    reflects structural barriers to healthcare access in LMIC. Transportation costs, work demands, and
    healthcare system capacity constraints make repeated visits difficult. This finding suggests that
    intervention design must account for structural realities of healthcare access rather than assuming
    ideal conditions. Policies should prioritize efficient, accessible intervention delivery over intensive
    approaches that may be structurally inaccessible to populations most at risk.
