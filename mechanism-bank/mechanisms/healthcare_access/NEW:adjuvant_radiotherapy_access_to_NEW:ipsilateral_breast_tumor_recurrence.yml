- 'Step 2: Adjuvant radiotherapy delivers targeted ionizing radiation to remaining breast tissue'
- 'Step 3: Radiation induces DNA damage and apoptosis in residual abnormal cells'

  recurrence'

description: In patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery for low-risk DCIS, additional radiotherapy
  significantly reduced the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor events (IBTE). However, radiotherapy did
  not reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), suggesting its effect is localized to the
  treated breast.

  equity_implications: Access to adjuvant radiotherapy depends on healthcare infrastructure including
    radiation oncology facilities, which are often concentrated in urban centers. Rural populations and
    those without comprehensive cancer centers may face barriers to receiving guideline-concordant treatment.
    Transportation burden, treatment duration (typically 3-6 weeks of daily treatments), and insurance
    coverage for radiation therapy represent structural determinants of whether patients receive this
    survival-improving intervention.
