mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: LSD administered in controlled therapeutic setting under clinical supervision'
- 'Step 2: Psychedelic experience facilitates introspection and emotional processing related to alcohol
  dependence'
- 'Step 3: Therapeutic integration sessions help consolidate insights and behavioral change'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced likelihood of achieving abstinence or substantial reduction in drinking'

description: 'In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials specifically examining LSD, the odds
  of achieving abstinence or substantial reduction in drinking were 1.99 times higher with LSD compared
  to placebo. When expanded to include 5 controlled trials without strict blinding requirements, OR was
  1.79 (95% CI: 1.36-2.34).'

  description: 'Relaxing inclusion to include non-double-blind trials increased sample (n=5) but showed

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The scheduling of LSD as a controlled substance with no accepted medical use has
    created decades-long barriers to researching this potentially effective treatment. This regulatory
    structure disproportionately affects populations with limited access to emerging treatments and clinical
    trials. Policy reform regarding psychedelic scheduling is a structural determinant of treatment access.
