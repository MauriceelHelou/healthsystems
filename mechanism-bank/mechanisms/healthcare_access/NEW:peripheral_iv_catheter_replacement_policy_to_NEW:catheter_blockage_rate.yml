direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Routine replacement policy ensures catheter changes before significant occlusion develops'
- 'Step 2: Fibrin sheath formation and blood clot accumulation occur over time'
- 'Step 3: Shorter dwell times reduce opportunity for occlusive complications'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of catheter failure due to blockage'

description: 'Catheter failure due to blockage was probably lower in routine-replacement group compared
  to clinically-indicated group (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29). Blockage rates: routine-replacement 519/3733
  (13.9%) vs clinically-indicated 560/3590 (15.6%)'

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the complexity of healthcare policy decisions. While
    routine replacement marginally reduces blockage, the clinical significance must be weighed against
    costs and patient experience.
