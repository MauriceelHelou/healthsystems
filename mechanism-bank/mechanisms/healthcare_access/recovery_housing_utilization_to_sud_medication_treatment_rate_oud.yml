- 'Step 1: Recovery housing programs develop MOUD-supportive policies (screening, medication oversight,
  storage protocols)'
- 'Step 2: Tailored policies enable safe integration of MOUD-prescribed residents into recovery housing'
- 'Step 3: Staff training and stigma-reduction strategies create supportive culture for medication adherence'
- 'Step 4: Residents experience accountability structures that promote continuity of MOUD treatment'
- 'Step 5: Increased access to recovery housing supports sustained MOUD engagement and retention'

description: Recovery housing programs that develop and implement MOUD-supportive policies (including
  screening/intake procedures, medication oversight, and storage protocols) can effectively support residents
  prescribed medications for opioid use disorder. These structured policy approaches, combined with staff
  training and stigma-reduction strategies, enable treatment continuity and promote medication adherence
  among residents with OUD.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 138
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study conducted across Texas with Level II and III MOUD-accepting recovery homes; geographic
    variation likely exists in state-level recovery housing regulations and MOUD acceptance policies

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies structural barriers to recovery housing access for MOUD-prescribed
    individuals, including organizational stigma, lack of practice-based guidance, and policy gaps. The
    study emphasizes the need for sustained funding, technical support, and research to ensure equitable
    access - highlighting how structural investment in recovery infrastructure can reduce treatment disparities
    for people with OUD.
