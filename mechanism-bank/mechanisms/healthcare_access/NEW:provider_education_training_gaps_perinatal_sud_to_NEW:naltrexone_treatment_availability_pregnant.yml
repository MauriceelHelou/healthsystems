mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medical education and continuing education lack adequate training on perinatal addiction medicine'
- 'Step 2: Providers report inexperience treating pregnant patients with SUD'
- 'Step 3: Provider discomfort and knowledge gaps reduce willingness to prescribe naltrexone'
- 'Step 4: Fewer providers offer naltrexone to pregnant individuals'

description: Provider inexperience was cited by 4.7% of respondents as a barrier to prescribing naltrexone
  during pregnancy, indicating gaps in medical education and training on perinatal addiction treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural deficiencies in medical education and workforce
    development. The training gaps identified are not individual provider failings but rather systemic
    underinvestment in perinatal addiction medicine curricula. Addressing this barrier requires structural
    changes to medical education, residency training, and continuing medical education programs to ensure
    providers are equipped to serve pregnant individuals with SUD.
