mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prehabilitation improves baseline functional capacity before surgery'
- 'Step 2: Better preoperative conditioning provides physiological reserve during surgical stress'
- 'Step 3: Improved baseline facilitates faster post-surgical recovery'
- 'Step 4: Functional capacity gains are sustained at 4 weeks post-surgery'

description: Functional capacity improvements from prehabilitation are sustained at 4 weeks post-surgery,
  with intervention groups walking 34.4 meters further than control groups on the six-minute walk test.

  equity_implications: Sustained post-surgical functional improvements may reduce downstream healthcare
    utilization and disability. However, access to post-surgical rehabilitation and support services may
    vary by socioeconomic status and insurance coverage, potentially affecting maintenance of gains.
