direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Providers develop subjective criteria for determining which patients are ''appropriate'' for
  telehealth OUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Provider conflict about appropriateness leads to inconsistent application of telehealth offering
  across patient populations'
- 'Step 3: Certain patient groups may be systematically excluded from telehealth options based on provider
  perceptions'
- 'Step 4: Differential offering of telehealth creates inequitable access to this accessible treatment
  modality'

description: The systematic review found that providers are conflicted about when and for whom telehealth
  OUD treatment is appropriate, which may lead to inequities in who is offered this form of care. This
  represents a structural barrier where provider gatekeeping creates differential access to an otherwise
  accessible treatment modality.

  description: Providers express more concern about rapport-building via telehealth compared to patients,
    potentially leading to more restrictive appropriateness judgments
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system structures and provider decision-making
    patterns can perpetuate inequities even when accessible treatment modalities exist. Provider bias
    about telehealth 'appropriateness' may systematically disadvantage patients who could benefit from
    telehealth access. This is a structural issue embedded in clinical practice patterns rather than individual
    patient factors.
