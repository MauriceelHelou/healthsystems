mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Internet-based interventions provide treatment access for problem drinkers who may not access
  traditional healthcare services'
- 'Step 2: Intervention reaches both regular problem drinkers (80.1% of sample, consuming 44.7 SU/week)
  and binge-only drinkers (19.9%)'
- 'Step 3: Treatment response defined as maintaining low-risk drinking levels (<14/21 SUs for women/men)'
- 'Step 4: Odds of achieving treatment response more than doubled (OR=2.20) compared to controls'
- 'Step 5: Movement to low-risk drinking patterns reduces progression to or severity of alcohol use disorder'

description: Internet-based alcohol interventions more than double the odds of achieving low-risk drinking
  levels (NNT=4.15), effectively reducing problem drinking patterns that could progress to alcohol use
  disorder. This provides a scalable structural intervention for the treatment gap in alcohol services.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism directly addresses the structural treatment gap for problem drinking.
    The abstract explicitly notes that face-to-face brief interventions, while effective, have 'limited
    implementation in routine care and the community.' Internet interventions provide a structural solution
    to this healthcare access barrier, particularly important for populations underserved by traditional
    treatment systems. The low NNT of 4.15 indicates high population-level impact potential for this accessible
    intervention modality.
