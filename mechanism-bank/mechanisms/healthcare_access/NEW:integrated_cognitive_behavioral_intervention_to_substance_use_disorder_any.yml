mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with co-occurring alcohol/drug use disorder (AOD) and mental health disorder (MHD)
  receive integrated cognitive-behavioral intervention'
- 'Step 2: Integrated treatment addresses both conditions simultaneously rather than sequentially or separately'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive restructuring and behavioral skills training target substance use triggers and mental
  health symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Reduced substance use outcomes, though effect size is small and non-significant for AOD outcomes
  alone'

  - Studies targeting alcohol use and/or post-traumatic stress disorder showed most promising effects
  - Studies comparing integrated CBI to single-disorder interventions (typically AOD-only) showed stronger
    effects

description: Integrated cognitive-behavioral interventions for individuals with co-occurring alcohol/other
  drug use disorder and mental health disorder show small effects (g=0.188) on substance use outcomes,
  though not statistically significant (p=0.061). High heterogeneity (I²=86%) indicates substantial variability
  across studies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights importance of integrated healthcare delivery systems
    that address co-occurring conditions simultaneously rather than requiring individuals to navigate
    separate treatment systems. The small effect sizes may reflect structural barriers including fragmented
    healthcare systems, inadequate insurance coverage for integrated treatment, and workforce shortages
    in dual-diagnosis care. Equitable access to integrated behavioral health services is a structural
    determinant of recovery outcomes.
