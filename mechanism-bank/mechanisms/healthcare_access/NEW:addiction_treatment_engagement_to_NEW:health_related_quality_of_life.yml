- 'Step 1: Treatment engagement provides structured support for addiction recovery'
- 'Step 2: QoL measurement in treatment allows tracking of recovery across multiple life domains'
- 'Step 3: Person-centered assessment using QoL outcomes focuses treatment on individual priorities'
- 'Step 4: Improved QoL domains (physical, psychological, social) reinforce recovery maintenance'
- 'Step 5: QoL improvements serve as meaningful treatment outcomes beyond abstinence'

description: The review emphasizes that consideration of an individual's quality of life can benefit assessment
  and treatment of addictive disorders. However, uncertainty remains over operationalisation of the construct
  as an outcome and the appropriateness of existing measures for these populations. The identification
  of 53 instruments across 41 domains reflects the multidimensional nature of QoL in addiction treatment
  contexts, though the paucity of validation evidence limits confidence in measurement.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to addiction treatment that incorporates QoL assessment is structurally
    determined by healthcare system factors including insurance coverage, treatment facility availability,
    and service design. The lack of validated QoL instruments for addiction populations represents a structural
    gap in healthcare quality measurement that may perpetuate inequities. Treatment programs serving marginalized
    populations may lack resources to implement comprehensive QoL assessment, potentially missing important
    recovery indicators beyond substance use reduction. This gap in measurement infrastructure reflects
    broader structural underinvestment in addiction treatment quality improvement.
