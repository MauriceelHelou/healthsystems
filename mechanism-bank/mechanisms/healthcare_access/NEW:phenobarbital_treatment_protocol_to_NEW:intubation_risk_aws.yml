mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe alcohol withdrawal can lead to respiratory compromise requiring intubation'
- 'Step 2: Phenobarbital may provide more effective control of severe withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Better symptom control may reduce progression to respiratory failure'
- 'Step 4: Trend toward reduced intubation rates, though not statistically significant'

description: Phenobarbital treatment shows a trend toward approximately 48% reduced risk of intubation
  (RR=0.52) compared to benzodiazepine treatment, but this did not reach statistical significance (P=0.08).
  Very high heterogeneity (I²=80%) limits interpretation.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Intubation and mechanical ventilation represent significant healthcare resource
    utilization and carry risks of complications. Structural factors influencing access to appropriate
    AWS treatment, including availability of addiction medicine specialists and standardized protocols,
    may affect intubation rates. Populations with limited healthcare access may present later with more
    severe withdrawal, increasing intubation risk regardless of treatment protocol.
