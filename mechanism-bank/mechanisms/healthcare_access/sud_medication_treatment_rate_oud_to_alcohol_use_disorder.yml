- 'Step 1: Access to pharmacological treatments like baclofen for AUD requires healthcare system capacity
  and provider willingness to prescribe'
- 'Step 2: Regulatory frameworks (e.g., French approval without dose limitation) enable flexible prescribing
  approaches'
- 'Step 3: Medication treatment suppresses cravings and supports abstinence or reduced drinking'
- 'Step 4: Sustained medication-assisted treatment reduces AUD prevalence and severity'

description: The paper examines how medication treatment for AUD using baclofen, when properly implemented
  with tailored dosing, can effectively reduce alcohol use disorder. This represents a healthcare access
  mechanism where availability of evidence-based pharmacological treatments determines treatment outcomes.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Regulatory approval varies by country - France has approved baclofen without dose limitation
    for AUD, which may not be the case in other jurisdictions

  description: French approval without dose limitation enables tailored prescribing approaches that may
    be restricted elsewhere
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to medication-assisted treatment for AUD is shaped by regulatory policies,
    healthcare system capacity, provider training, and insurance coverage - all structural factors. Geographic
    variation in approval status creates inequitable access based on where patients live. The paper's
    focus on French regulatory context highlights how policy decisions at the national level shape individual
    treatment possibilities.
