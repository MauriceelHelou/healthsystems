mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) integrated with
  electronic health records helps emergency physicians identify low-risk pulmonary
  embolism patients eligible for outpatient management using validated risk-stratification
  tools like the PE Severity Index'
- 'Step 2: Eligible low-risk PE patients are discharged home with anticoagulation
  therapy (warfarin with enoxaparin bridging) instead of being admitted, with timely
  follow-up care coordinated through anticoagulation services and primary care providers'
- 'Step 3: Safe outpatient management of PE reduces unnecessary hospitalizations for
  patients who do not require inpatient care, decreasing overall hospitalization rates
  without increasing adverse outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Systematic support for outpatient PE management through physician education,
  audit and feedback, and care pathway modifications increases the proportion of eligible
  patients managed as outpatients from baseline rates of 1-8% toward higher rates
  seen in other settings (up to 50%)'

description: Higher rates of outpatient management for eligible pulmonary embolism
  patients reduce hospitalizations by avoiding unnecessary inpatient admissions. Evidence
  shows that up to 50% of acute PE patients can be safely managed as outpatients using
  validated risk-stratification tools, yet most centers hospitalize these patients
  at rates of 92-99%. Implementing clinical decision support systems combined with
  physician education and timely follow-up care enables identification and safe discharge
  of low-risk PE patients, reducing hospitalization rates without increasing adverse
  outcomes.
