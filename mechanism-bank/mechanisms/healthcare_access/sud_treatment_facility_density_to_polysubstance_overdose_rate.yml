mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OAT settings with capacity for integrated screening increase detection of polysubstance use'
- 'Step 2: Identification enables delivery of brief interventions addressing co-occurring substance misuse'
- 'Step 3: Reduced substance risk scores decrease dangerous drug combinations'
- 'Step 4: Improved clinical outcomes and reduced psychosocial problems lower polysubstance overdose risk'
- 'Step 5: Systematic SBI integration in OAT programs creates population-level protective effects'

  for co-occurring substance misuse.

  description: Studies showed limited and incomplete screening for substance misuse in OAT settings, suggesting
    implementation gaps reduce potential benefits
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that screening and intervention delivery is 'limited and incomplete'
    in OAT settings reflects structural underinvestment in comprehensive addiction care. People with opioid
    use disorder represent a marginalized population, and gaps in integrated services perpetuate health
    inequities. Policy interventions requiring comprehensive screening protocols could address this structural
    barrier.
