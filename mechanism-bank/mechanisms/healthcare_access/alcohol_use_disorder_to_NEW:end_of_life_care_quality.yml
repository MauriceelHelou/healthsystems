category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder creates distinctive clinical needs at end-of-life that differ from general
  population'
- 'Step 2: Formal and informal caregivers experience difficulties providing appropriate care to this population'
- 'Step 3: Palliative care staff may lack training in managing alcohol-related complications alongside
  terminal illness'
- 'Step 4: Care fragmentation occurs due to inadequate collaboration between alcohol services and palliative
  care'
- 'Step 5: Quality of end-of-life care is compromised due to these systemic care and skills issues'

description: Individuals with alcohol use disorder experience diminished end-of-life care quality due
  to healthcare system limitations. The review identified care and skills issues affecting both formal
  caregivers and informal support networks, with distinctive needs of this population not being adequately
  met by standard palliative care models.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism traces poor outcomes to healthcare system structure rather than patient
    behavior. The review explicitly identifies the need for inclusive policies and staff sensitization
    as structural solutions. This frames the issue as a healthcare system failure to adapt to population
    needs rather than patient non-compliance.
