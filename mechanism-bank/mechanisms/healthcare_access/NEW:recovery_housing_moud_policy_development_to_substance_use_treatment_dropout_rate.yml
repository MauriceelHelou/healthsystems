description: Development of structured MOUD policies in recovery housing (including screening/intake procedures,
  medication oversight, and storage/access protocols) promotes treatment retention by addressing common
  barriers such as medication diversion concerns and care continuity gaps. These policies create accountability
  structures that support residents in maintaining their MOUD treatment while in recovery housing.

  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes that policy infrastructure at the organizational level
    - not individual motivation - determines treatment continuity. The study highlights structural needs
    (sustained funding, technical support, research for best practices) as essential for equitable access
    to recovery housing for MOUD-prescribed individuals. This shifts responsibility from individuals to
    systems and organizations.
