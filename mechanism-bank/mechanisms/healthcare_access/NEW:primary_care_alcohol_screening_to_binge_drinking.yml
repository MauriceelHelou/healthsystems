mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care screening with AUDIT-C identifies patients with hazardous drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Screening alone (without intervention) may prompt patient self-reflection on drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Both intervention and control groups showed similar alcohol consumption at follow-up, suggesting
  screening itself has an effect'
- 'Step 4: Assessment reactivity - the act of being screened may influence behavior regardless of subsequent
  intervention'

description: This pragmatic cluster RCT found no evidence that a doctor-delivered ultra-brief intervention
  (<1 minute) for hazardous drinking was more effective than simplified AUDIT-C screening alone in reducing
  alcohol consumption at 24 weeks. Both groups showed similar total alcohol consumption (~1000-1050 g/4
  weeks), with a negligible effect size (Hedges' g = 0.02). The null finding suggests that within primary
  care settings without existing alcohol intervention infrastructure, screening alone may produce similar
  outcomes to screening plus minimal intervention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This study highlights structural factors in healthcare delivery: (1) The intervention
    was designed to be implementable in busy primary care settings (<1 minute), acknowledging time constraints
    in healthcare systems; (2) The study selected clinics without routine alcohol screening, revealing
    gaps in healthcare infrastructure for addressing hazardous drinking; (3) The null finding does not
    indicate that hazardous drinking cannot be addressed, but rather that structural investment in more
    intensive interventions may be needed; (4) Healthcare system capacity (availability of treatment and
    self-help groups) was a consideration in clinic selection, highlighting how structural supports influence
    intervention effectiveness.'
