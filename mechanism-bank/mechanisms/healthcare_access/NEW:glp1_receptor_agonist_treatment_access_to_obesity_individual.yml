mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: GLP-1 receptor agonists act on peripheral receptors to enhance satiety signaling'
- 'Step 2: Central GLP-1 receptor activation reduces food reward and modulates appetite regulation'
- 'Step 3: Decreased caloric intake through both metabolic and behavioral mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Sustained weight loss and reduced obesity prevalence'

description: GLP-1 receptor agonists have revolutionized obesity treatment through dual peripheral and
  central mechanisms that reduce appetite and modify reward-based eating behaviors.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While GLP-1 agonists offer effective obesity treatment, structural barriers including
    high costs, insurance coverage limitations, and supply constraints create inequitable access. These
    medications are often more accessible to higher-income populations, potentially widening health disparities.
    The biological mechanism supports understanding obesity as a neuroendocrine condition responsive to
    medical intervention rather than a character flaw.
