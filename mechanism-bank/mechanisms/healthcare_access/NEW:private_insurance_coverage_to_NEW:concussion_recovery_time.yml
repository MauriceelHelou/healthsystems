mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Private insurance provides greater access to specialized concussion care and follow-up services'
- 'Step 2: Insured patients can access timely diagnostic testing and rehabilitation services'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive care facilitates faster clinical recovery from concussion'
- 'Step 4: Reduced barriers to care enable adherence to treatment protocols and return-to-activity guidelines'

description: Private insurance coverage is associated with faster clinical recovery from concussion among
  athletes. This relationship likely operates through improved access to specialized care, diagnostic
  services, and rehabilitation support that privately insured individuals can more readily obtain.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how economic barriers embedded in the healthcare system
    create differential recovery outcomes. Insurance status is a structural determinant shaped by employment,
    income, and policy decisions rather than individual choice. The finding points to systemic inequities
    in healthcare access that disadvantage uninsured or underinsured populations in recovering from injury.
