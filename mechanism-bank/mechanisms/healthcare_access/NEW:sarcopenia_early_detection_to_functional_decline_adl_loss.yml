mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sarcopenia screening identifies individuals with reduced muscle mass and strength before severe
  functional impairment'
- 'Step 2: Early identification enables implementation of targeted interventions (resistance exercise,
  nutrition optimization)'
- 'Step 3: Timely intervention can slow or reverse muscle loss progression'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of severe sarcopenia reduces risk of falls, disability, and loss of independence
  in activities of daily living'

description: Early identification of sarcopenia through effective screening tools enables preventive interventions
  that can reduce functional decline. The Ishii Test's demonstrated accuracy for early detection provides
  a pathway to intervene before older adults experience significant loss of activities of daily living
  independence.

  equity_implications: Access to effective screening represents a structural determinant of healthy aging.
    Disparities in healthcare access, particularly for preventive services, may result in differential
    rates of sarcopenia detection across socioeconomic groups and geographic areas. The simplicity of
    the Ishii Test could help reduce these structural barriers by enabling screening in community settings
    and primary care rather than requiring specialized geriatric assessments.
