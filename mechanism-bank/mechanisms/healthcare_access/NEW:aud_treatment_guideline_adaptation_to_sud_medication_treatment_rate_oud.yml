category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: International guidelines for AUD management exist but have not been adapted to primary care
  practice'
- 'Step 2: Lack of primary care-specific guidelines creates uncertainty among GPs about appropriate prescribing'
- 'Step 3: Absence of clear protocols reduces provider confidence and competence in pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Lower prescription rates of anti-craving treatments result in undertreated AUD population'

description: The review identifies that while AUD management guidelines including pharmacotherapy exist
  at international level, they have not been adapted for primary care practice, creating a structural
  barrier to evidence-based treatment in the setting where most patients seek help.

  description: Availability of psychological and behavioral adjuncts to pharmacotherapy was identified
    as a facilitating factor
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exposes a healthcare system failure where clinical guidelines developed
    in specialty settings are not translated for the frontline providers most likely to encounter AUD
    patients. This represents a systemic knowledge translation gap that particularly affects populations
    with limited access to specialty care.
