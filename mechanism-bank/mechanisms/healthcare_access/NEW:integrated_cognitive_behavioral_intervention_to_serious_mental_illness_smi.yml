description: Integrated cognitive-behavioral interventions show small but statistically significant effects
  (g=0.169, p=0.024) on mental health disorder symptoms among individuals with co-occurring substance
  use disorders. Moderate heterogeneity (I²=58%) suggests variability but less than for substance use
  outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding underscores the structural need for healthcare systems that provide
    integrated rather than siloed care. The historical separation of mental health and substance use treatment
    systems creates barriers for individuals with co-occurring conditions, often resulting in treatment
    gaps and poorer outcomes. Addressing this requires policy changes in healthcare financing, workforce
    training, and service delivery models.
