description: Criminal justice diversion programs represent a structural opportunity to provide overdose
  education and naloxone distribution (OEND) to high-risk individuals, as all participants showed high
  propensity for overdose exposure (68% personal, 79% witnessed) regardless of justice involvement pattern,
  yet only 56% had basic naloxone knowledge.

  description: Both high involvement (younger first arrest, more lifetime arrests) and low involvement
    (older first arrest, more recent arrests) classes showed similar low naloxone knowledge, indicating
    universal need for OEND
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies diversion programs as a critical structural intervention
    point. The study demonstrates that the population entering these programs has substantial unmet harm
    reduction needs regardless of their justice involvement history. The conclusion that 'all PWUO in
    criminal justice diversion programs could benefit from OEND' represents a policy-actionable finding
    that shifts responsibility from individuals to systems. The structure of diversion programs can be
    modified to include systematic OEND as standard care.
