  node_id: suboptimal_blood_pressure_management

direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Paucity of research data on optimal management of hypertension in alcohol
  withdrawal leads to lack of standardized treatment protocols'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians must individualize treatment without clear evidence-based guidelines,
  leading to variable practice patterns'
- 'Step 3: Uncertainty about medication selection and dosing may result in delayed
  treatment initiation or inadequate blood pressure control'
- 'Step 4: Suboptimal management increases risk of progression to hypertensive urgency
  or emergency with potential end-organ damage'
