direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited availability of immediately accessible interpreter services creates communication gaps
  between healthcare providers and immigrant patients'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare professionals lack knowledge about interpreter service availability and patient
  entitlements'
- 'Step 3: Restrictive policies regarding user fees create financial barriers to interpreter utilization'
- 'Step 4: Unaddressed language barriers persist during medical encounters, limiting effective healthcare
  communication'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system policies and resource allocation
    decisions create structural barriers for immigrant populations. The barrier is not individual inability
    to learn a language but rather system-level failures to provide adequate interpretation infrastructure.
    Inequities arise from restrictive policies that limit entitlements to interpreter services.
