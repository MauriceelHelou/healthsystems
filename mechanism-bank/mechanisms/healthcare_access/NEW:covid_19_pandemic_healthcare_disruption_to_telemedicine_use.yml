- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid shift away from in-person healthcare'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare systems adapted by expanding telehealth infrastructure and regulatory flexibility'
- 'Step 3: Patients and providers adopted telehealth as primary modality for AUD treatment'
- 'Step 4: Telehealth became common modality with 90.9% of AUD patients receiving at least one telehealth
  visit'

description: The COVID-19 pandemic drove massive adoption of telehealth for AUD treatment in the VA system,
  with only 9.1% of patients receiving only in-person visits during the study period (March 2020-February
  2021)

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how policy and systemic responses to public health emergencies
    can rapidly restructure healthcare delivery. The pandemic served as a natural experiment demonstrating
    telehealth feasibility for AUD treatment. This represents a structural shift in how substance use
    disorder treatment can be delivered, with implications for reducing geographic and transportation
    barriers.
