mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-impaired drivers involved in motor vehicle collisions are transported to hospitals/trauma
  centers'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare facilities have varying institutional policies for blood alcohol concentration measurement'
- 'Step 3: Some measurements are conducted for clinical purposes only and are not legally admissible'
- 'Step 4: Lack of standardized protocols for obtaining legally admissible BAC evidence limits prosecution'
- 'Step 5: Without admissible evidence, drivers cannot be charged or convicted for DUI/DWI'

description: The systematic review identified institutional procedures and policies for obtaining legally
  admissible blood alcohol concentration measurements as a major source of heterogeneity affecting DUI/DWI
  conviction rates. The wide range in conviction rates (0-85%) across 26 studies reflects these structural
  differences in how healthcare facilities collect and handle BAC evidence.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Heterogeneity between institutional procedures and policies for obtaining legally admissible
    BAC measurements was a key source of variation across studies and precluded meta-analysis. Conviction
    rates ranged from 0% to 85% across sites.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights a critical structural gap at the interface of healthcare
    and criminal justice systems. The lack of standardized protocols for obtaining legally admissible
    BAC evidence in hospitals and trauma centers represents a systemic failure that allows the majority
    of alcohol-impaired drivers to escape legal consequences. This is not about individual healthcare
    provider decisions but rather about institutional policies, legal frameworks, and inter-system coordination.
    Policy interventions could include standardized evidence collection protocols, implied consent law
    modifications, and improved healthcare-law enforcement coordination. The equity implications include
    potential disparities in which hospitals/jurisdictions have robust protocols, potentially creating
    geographic inequities in DUI/DWI enforcement.
