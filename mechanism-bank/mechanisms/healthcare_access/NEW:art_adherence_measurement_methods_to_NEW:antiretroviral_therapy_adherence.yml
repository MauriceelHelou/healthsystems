direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different adherence measurement methods (self-report, pill counts, pharmacy refills, electronic
  monitoring) are used across studies'
- 'Step 2: Self-report methods may overestimate adherence due to social desirability bias'
- 'Step 3: Pharmacy-based measures may miss actual consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Variation in measurement approaches contributes to heterogeneity in reported adherence estimates'

description: The review explicitly reports on methods used to measure adherence across the 53 included
  studies. Variation in measurement methodology contributes to heterogeneity in adherence estimates and
  may affect comparability across settings.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 22603
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Measurement methods likely vary by country and healthcare system capacity, contributing
    to regional variation in reported adherence
moderators:
- name: resource_availability
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher-resource settings may use more objective measures like electronic monitoring while
    lower-resource settings rely on self-report
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The variation in measurement methods reflects differential healthcare system capacity
    and research infrastructure across Latin American and Caribbean countries. Resource constraints may
    limit use of objective adherence measures in lower-income settings, potentially affecting the accuracy
    of adherence assessment and subsequent intervention planning.
