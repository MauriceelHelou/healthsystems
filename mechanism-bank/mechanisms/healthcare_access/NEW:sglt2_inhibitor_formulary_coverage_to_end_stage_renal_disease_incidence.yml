- 'Step 1: Health systems include SGLT2 inhibitors in standard formularies for CKD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Cost-effectiveness evidence supports payer coverage decisions'
- 'Step 3: Patients receive SGLT2 inhibitors as part of standard care protocols'
- 'Step 4: Treatment slows GFR decline and reduces proteinuria'
- 'Step 5: Fewer patients progress to dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease'

  influences population-level progression to end-stage renal disease by enabling broader access to nephroprotective
  therapies.

  description: When analyzed from health system perspective in high-income countries, SGLT2 inhibitors
    with SoC were cost-saving for CKD patients with T2D
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural healthcare policy decisions that determine
    medication access. Cost-effectiveness evidence influences formulary decisions, which in turn affect
    population health outcomes. Disparities in healthcare infrastructure, insurance coverage, and pharmaceutical
    pricing policies create inequitable access to these treatments across and within countries. The economic
    burden of CKD disproportionately affects lower-income populations who may face greater barriers to
    accessing optimal treatment.
