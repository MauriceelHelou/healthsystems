- 'Step 1: Technology developers design interfaces with or without consideration for older adult needs'
- 'Step 2: Poor usability creates technology-related barriers including complexity and accessibility issues'
- 'Step 3: Age-appropriate design features reduce cognitive load and physical barriers to use'
- 'Step 4: Improved usability increases sustained adoption and engagement with health technologies'

description: Technology design and usability factors significantly influence health technology adoption
  among older adults. Poor interface design creates barriers while age-appropriate, accessible design
  facilitates adoption.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Technology design reflects market priorities that historically excluded older adults.
    The structural issue is that profit-driven technology development often fails to incorporate accessibility
    features for aging populations with chronic conditions, creating systematic exclusion from digital
    health benefits.
