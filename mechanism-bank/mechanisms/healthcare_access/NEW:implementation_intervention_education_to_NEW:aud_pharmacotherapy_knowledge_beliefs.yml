- 'Step 1: Multi-faceted implementation intervention provides provider and patient education about AUD
  pharmacotherapy options'
- 'Step 2: Educational components address knowledge gaps about relative advantage and priority of AUD
  treatment'
- 'Step 3: Clinician reminders reinforce learning and prompt consideration of pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Improved knowledge and beliefs about AUD pharmacotherapy reduce informational barriers to implementation'

description: Traditional educational approaches in implementation interventions successfully address knowledge
  and belief barriers to AUD pharmacotherapy in primary care settings. Post-implementation interviews
  showed that barriers related to Relative Advantage, Relative Priority, and Knowledge & Beliefs about
  the Innovation were no longer identified after the nine-month intervention period.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system structures (provider training,
    clinical decision support) can facilitate or impede access to evidence-based AUD treatment. The intervention
    addresses structural barriers at the provider level rather than placing blame on patients for not
    seeking treatment. However, the limited impact suggests that educational approaches alone cannot overcome
    deeper structural barriers.
