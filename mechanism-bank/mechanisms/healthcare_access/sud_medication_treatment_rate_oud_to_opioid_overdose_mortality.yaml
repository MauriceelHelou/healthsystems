category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine provides
  stable opioid receptor occupancy, reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Stable receptor occupancy increases opioid tolerance, reducing the euphoric
  effects of illicit opioids and decreasing the likelihood of illicit opioid use'
- 'Step 3: Reduced illicit opioid use decreases exposure to contaminated or unpredictably
  potent street drugs (e.g., fentanyl-adulterated substances)'
- 'Step 4: Regular engagement with OAT programs connects patients to healthcare systems,
  enabling overdose prevention education and naloxone distribution'
- 'Step 5: Supervised medication administration in some programs reduces risk of diversion
  and ensures consistent dosing, preventing accidental overdose from dose fluctuations'
- 'Step 6: The cumulative effect is substantially reduced drug-related mortality during
  active OAT engagement, with highest risk during treatment transitions (initiation
  and cessation)'

description: Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) with methadone or buprenorphine is strongly
  associated with reduced drug-related mortality among people with opioid dependence.
  Meta-analyses show that drug-related mortality during OAT is approximately 59% lower
  than during periods not receiving treatment (RR 0.41). Untreated individuals have
  8-fold higher overdose mortality compared to those in treatment. This protective
  effect is mediated through stabilized opioid receptor activity, reduced illicit
  drug use, and connection to healthcare services. The effect is consistent across
  demographic subgroups but varies critically by treatment phase, with elevated risk
  during methadone initiation and particularly high risk in the 4 weeks following
  treatment cessation.
