mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients without AUD diagnosis receive multiple brief interventions over time'
- 'Step 2: Repeated clinical encounters signal persistent unhealthy alcohol use requiring escalation'
- 'Step 3: Multiple BIs may increase patient readiness for change through accumulated exposure to health
  messaging'
- 'Step 4: Repeated interventions may trigger provider recognition of need for specialty referral'
- 'Step 5: Greater likelihood of specialty treatment engagement among those receiving multiple BIs'

description: Among patients without an AUD diagnosis, documentation of more than one brief intervention
  was associated with a 75% increase in likelihood of receiving specialty treatment compared to no BI,
  suggesting repeated interventions may function as intended in the stepped care model for this subgroup.

  description: This positive effect of repeated BI was observed only among patients WITHOUT AUD diagnosis;
    effect among those with AUD not separately reported for repeated BI
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding suggests that when healthcare systems provide sustained, repeated
    engagement rather than one-time interventions, the stepped care model may function as intended. This
    has implications for healthcare system design - single-encounter interventions may be insufficient,
    and systems should build in mechanisms for repeated engagement and follow-up. The differential effect
    by diagnosis status suggests need for tailored intervention pathways based on clinical severity.
