description: Digital interventions may overcome barriers to continuing care after AUD treatment discharge.
  Four of 11 studies (2 apps, 2 text message interventions) showed statistically significant results in
  prolonging abstinence, though overall evidence remains insufficient to support efficacy.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to healthcare access that affect AUD
    treatment continuity. Many individuals with AUD face geographic isolation, transportation barriers,
    stigma, and scheduling conflicts that prevent access to in-person aftercare. Digital interventions
    represent a structural solution that could reduce inequities in treatment access. However, effectiveness
    may be moderated by digital divide issues affecting lower-income populations, older adults, and rural
    communities who may have limited smartphone access or digital literacy.
