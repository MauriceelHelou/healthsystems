  node_id: sud_treatment_entry_rate

direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital health interventions (telehealth, mobile apps) reduce geographic and physical barriers
  to accessing treatment facilities'
- 'Step 2: Reduced psychosocial barriers (stigma, anonymity concerns) through remote delivery increases
  willingness to seek treatment'
- 'Step 3: Improved treatment accessibility leads to higher rates of SUD treatment initiation and engagement'
- 'Step 4: Continued access during crises (e.g., COVID-19 quarantine) maintains treatment continuity'

description: Digital health interventions including telehealth and mobile applications improve access
  to substance use disorder treatment by reducing geographic, logistical, and psychosocial barriers. This
  is particularly critical during healthcare disruptions like COVID-19.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: COVID-19 pandemic differentially impacted clinic capacity by region; rural areas may
    have greater benefit from telehealth due to existing treatment access barriers

  description: Mobile phone apps identified as most appropriate delivery mode for SUD patients compared
    to other digital platforms
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to healthcare access rather than individual
    behavior. Limited clinic capacity during COVID-19 represents a systemic healthcare infrastructure
    failure that disproportionately affected patients with SUD. The lack of clinician involvement in app
    development reflects broader healthcare system fragmentation between technology development and clinical
    care delivery.
