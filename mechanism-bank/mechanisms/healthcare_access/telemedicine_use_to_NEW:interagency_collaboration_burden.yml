mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telehealth requires new forms of documentation and communication protocols'
- 'Step 2: Increased paperwork burden affects clinicians conducting assessments and facilitating treatment
  linkages'
- 'Step 3: Technological challenges create additional workflow barriers'
- 'Step 4: Inter/intra-agency collaboration requires more effort in virtual environment, affecting coordination
  between DOC and community treatment providers'

description: Telehealth implementation increases administrative and technological burdens on clinicians,
  requiring more effort for inter/intra-agency collaboration between Department of Corrections and community-based
  SUD treatment providers.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare delivery system changes create structural
    burdens on workforce capacity. The need for improved information-sharing infrastructure and technology
    training represents a systems-level intervention requirement, not an individual worker competency
    issue. Structural underfunding of criminal justice-involved SUD treatment coordination creates implementation
    barriers.
