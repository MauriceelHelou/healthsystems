mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems integrate biomarker testing (liver injury markers, fibrosis tests) into
  routine alcohol care'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians provide personalized advice to patients based on objective biomarker results showing
  liver damage'
- 'Step 3: Tangible biological evidence of harm increases patient perception of risk and severity'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced risk perception motivates behavior change and reduction in alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Sustained reduction in weekly alcohol intake reduces binge drinking episodes'

description: Adding advice based on biomarkers of liver injury or non-invasive tests of liver fibrosis
  to routine care significantly reduces weekly alcohol consumption by 74.4 g/week compared to standard
  care without biomarker feedback.

  description: Both liver injury biomarkers and non-invasive liver fibrosis tests showed effectiveness,
    though specific comparative efficacy not detailed
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare system-level intervention rather than individual
    blame. The structural component involves integrating biomarker testing into routine alcohol care protocols,
    making early identification and personalized intervention accessible as part of standard healthcare
    delivery. The effectiveness depends on healthcare system capacity to implement such screening and
    counseling, highlighting structural barriers in healthcare access and quality.
