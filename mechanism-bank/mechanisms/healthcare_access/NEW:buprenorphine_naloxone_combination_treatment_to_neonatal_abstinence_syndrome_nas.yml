category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant individuals with opioid use disorder receive buprenorphine-naloxone combination treatment'
- 'Step 2: Naloxone component has limited oral bioavailability, reducing systemic opioid exposure when
  taken as prescribed'
- 'Step 3: Potentially different pharmacokinetic profile leads to altered fetal opioid exposure patterns'
- 'Step 4: Reduced or modified in utero opioid exposure decreases severity of neonatal withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring treatment in exposed infants'

description: Prenatal exposure to buprenorphine combined with naloxone was associated with a 23% lower
  risk of neonatal abstinence syndrome compared to buprenorphine alone (absolute risk 37.4% vs 55.8%).

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how medication formulation policies and treatment guidelines
    create structural barriers for pregnant individuals with OUD. Historical restriction of combination
    product in pregnancy limited treatment options. Expanding safe treatment options addresses structural
    healthcare access inequities for this vulnerable population. Medicaid population focus reveals safety
    data for economically disadvantaged pregnant individuals.
