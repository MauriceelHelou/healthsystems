mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dialysis requires multiple sessions per week with significant time burden'
- 'Step 2: Dialysis patients experience more physical symptoms and dietary restrictions than transplant
  recipients'
- 'Step 3: Vascular access complications and infections create additional health burdens'
- 'Step 4: Reduced flexibility in daily scheduling limits participation in normal life activities'
- 'Step 5: Dialysis patients have substantially worse quality of life than transplant recipients'

description: Young adults on dialysis have more than twice the quality of life decrement compared to transplant
  recipients, both measured against healthy peers.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to kidney transplantation is not equitable - organ allocation systems, geographic
    proximity to transplant centers, socioeconomic factors affecting ability to navigate waitlist requirements,
    and racial disparities in transplant access all contribute to differential treatment modality assignment.
    These structural factors perpetuate health inequities.
