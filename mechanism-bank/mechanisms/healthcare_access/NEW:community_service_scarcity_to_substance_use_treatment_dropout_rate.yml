direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Resource-scarce communities lack comprehensive substance use disorder services'
- 'Step 2: Gaps in service availability disrupt the continuum of care for people with substance use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Participants'' readiness for change naturally fluctuates over time'
- 'Step 4: When services are unavailable during periods of readiness, participants cannot access needed
  support'
- 'Step 5: Disrupted care continuum leads to participant disengagement from LEAD and related services'

description: Resource scarcity in communities disrupts the continuum of care for substance use disorder
  treatment, causing participants to disengage when their readiness for change cannot be matched with
  available services
quantitative_effects:

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Resource scarcity varied across the four North Carolina LEAD sites studied, with some
    communities having complete absence of certain resources and services

    resources, partially mitigating service gaps
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural resource inequities create barriers
    to sustained treatment engagement. The lack of community resources is a systemic issue reflecting
    disinvestment in certain communities, not individual failure. Program staff must 'patch holes and
    bridge gaps' to compensate for structural deficits
