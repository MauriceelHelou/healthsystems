mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited access to technology and broadband creates barriers to accessing telemedicine and online
  counseling services'
- 'Step 2: Digital skills deficits prevent individuals from navigating online health information and telehealth
  platforms'
- 'Step 3: Reduced social resources diminish ability to leverage digital networks for treatment referrals
  and support'
- 'Step 4: COVID-19 pandemic accelerated shift to telemedicine, widening treatment access gap for digitally
  excluded populations'
- 'Step 5: Decreased engagement with medication-assisted treatment programs due to inability to access
  virtual care'

description: Digital inequalities including limited access to technology, insufficient digital skills,
  and reduced social resources contribute to negative health outcomes by creating barriers to treatment
  seeking for opioid use disorder, particularly as treatment delivery shifted toward telemedicine during
  COVID-19
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Digital inequality varies significantly by geographic location, with rural and underserved
    areas having less broadband access and technology infrastructure

  description: Health literacy plays an integral part in the capacity of individuals to appraise opioid
    medication-related online information, amplifying or mitigating the effects of digital access

  strength: strong
  description: Those with fewer economic resources face compounded digital inequalities in both technology
    access and skills
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural root causes including technology infrastructure
    investment, broadband policy, and socioeconomic inequities that determine digital access. It avoids
    individual blame by focusing on systemic barriers rather than personal choices. Equity implications
    include disproportionate impact on low-income populations, rural residents, and marginalized communities
    who face compounded digital exclusion.
