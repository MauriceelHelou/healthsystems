- 'Step 1: Systematic screening in primary care identifies excessive drinkers before severe health consequences
  develop'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions reduce weekly alcohol consumption by approximately 20 grams'
- 'Step 3: Sustained reduction in consumption decreases risk of alcohol-related liver disease, cardiovascular
  events, and cancer'
- 'Step 4: Early intervention prevents progression from hazardous drinking to alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 5: Reduced cumulative alcohol exposure over time decreases alcohol-induced mortality risk'

description: Brief alcohol interventions in primary care settings reduce weekly alcohol consumption, which
  over time decreases cumulative exposure to alcohol and associated mortality risks. The intervention
  targets hazardous and harmful drinkers before they develop severe alcohol-related conditions that contribute
  to mortality.

  description: Higher baseline consumption (mean 244 g/week in study populations) may indicate greater
    potential mortality risk reduction from intervention
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism connects healthcare system structure to population-level mortality
    outcomes. The structural availability and accessibility of primary care determines population exposure
    to this evidence-based intervention. Health equity implications are significant: communities with
    inadequate primary care infrastructure may experience higher alcohol-induced mortality due to missed
    intervention opportunities. This represents a systemic rather than individual-level determinant of
    alcohol-related death.'
