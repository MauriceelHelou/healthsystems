mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PHC sectors implement online and offline interventions to support TB patients'
- 'Step 2: Interventions provide education, reminders, and support for medication adherence'
- 'Step 3: Patient engagement with treatment protocols increases through structured support'
- 'Step 4: Treatment compliance improves, leading to better TB outcomes'

    compliance

  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that treatment compliance is not simply an individual
    choice but is strongly influenced by the availability and quality of structural supports provided
    by healthcare systems. Improving compliance requires system-level investments in intervention programs
    rather than blaming patients for non-adherence.
