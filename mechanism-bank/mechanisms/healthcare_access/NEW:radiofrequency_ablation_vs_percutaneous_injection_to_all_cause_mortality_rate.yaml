category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Radiofrequency ablation delivers thermal energy directly to hepatocellular
  carcinoma tumors, causing more complete coagulative necrosis compared to percutaneous
  injection therapies (acetic acid or alcohol injection)'
- 'Step 2: More complete tumor ablation with radiofrequency results in lower rates
  of local tumor recurrence and residual viable tumor tissue'
- 'Step 3: Reduced tumor burden and recurrence leads to improved liver function preservation
  and delayed disease progression'
- 'Step 4: These factors translate into reduced all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up
  compared to percutaneous acetic acid or alcohol injection therapies'

description: Radiofrequency ablation is associated with lower all-cause mortality
  compared to percutaneous injection therapies (acetic acid injection and alcohol
  injection) in people with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma who are not eligible
  for surgery. This Cochrane systematic review of 14 trials (2,494 participants) found
  that all-cause mortality at maximal follow-up was higher with percutaneous acetic
  acid injection and percutaneous alcohol injection than with radiofrequency ablation.
