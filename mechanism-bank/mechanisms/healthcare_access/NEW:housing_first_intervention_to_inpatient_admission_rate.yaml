mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing First programs provide rapid access to permanent, non-abstinence-contingent
  housing for homeless individuals'
- 'Step 2: Stable housing reduces exposure to environmental hazards, violence, infectious
  disease, and extreme weather that contribute to acute health crises'
- 'Step 3: Having a stable address facilitates engagement with primary care and outpatient
  services, enabling preventive care and chronic disease management'
- 'Step 4: Improved living conditions allow for proper medication storage, rest, nutrition,
  and hygiene that support health maintenance'
- 'Step 5: Reduced acute health crises and better access to outpatient care decreases
  the need for emergency hospitalization'

description: Housing First interventions reduce hospitalization rates among homeless
  individuals by providing stable housing that decreases environmental health risks,
  enables better chronic disease management, and facilitates access to outpatient
  care. The meta-analysis of 4 RCTs found that intervention groups experienced significantly
  fewer hospitalizations (IRR=0.76, 95% CI 0.70-0.83) compared to control groups,
  representing a 24% reduction in hospitalization rates.
