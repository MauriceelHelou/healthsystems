mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Naltrexone acts as an opioid antagonist blocking endogenous opioid receptors
  involved in alcohol reward pathways'
- 'Step 2: Blockade of mu-opioid receptors reduces the reinforcing effects and subjective
  rewarding properties of alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Diminished reward and reinforcement from alcohol consumption leads to decreased
  motivation to drink'
- 'Step 4: Reduced drinking frequency and heavy drinking episodes occur when medication
  is consistently available and taken'
