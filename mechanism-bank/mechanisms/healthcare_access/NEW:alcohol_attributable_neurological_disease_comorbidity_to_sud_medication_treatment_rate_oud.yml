direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use causes neurological complications including neuropathy, cognitive impairment,
  and seizure disorders'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers may have concerns about CNS-active medications in neurologically compromised
  patients'
- 'Step 3: Perceived complexity of managing multiple neurological conditions may deter medication initiation'
- 'Step 4: Specialist fragmentation between neurology and addiction medicine creates care gaps'
- 'Step 5: Patients with neurological damage from alcohol receive reduced access to medications that could
  prevent further harm'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding demonstrates how healthcare systems fail to provide integrated care
    for patients with substance use disorders and their medical sequelae. The structural separation of
    addiction medicine from other specialties, combined with potential prescriber uncertainty about complex
    patients, creates treatment gaps that perpetuate health inequities among the most vulnerable AUD patients.
