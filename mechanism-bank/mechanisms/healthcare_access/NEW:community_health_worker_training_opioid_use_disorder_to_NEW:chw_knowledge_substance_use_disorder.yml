- 'Step 1: ECHO telehealth program connects CHWs in medically underserved areas with subject matter experts
  at academic hub'
- 'Step 2: CHWs receive training on behavioral health integration focused on opioid prescription misuse'
- 'Step 3: Knowledge transfer occurs through teleconferencing technology overcoming geographic barriers'
- 'Step 4: CHW knowledge attainment increases above pretest baseline levels'

description: The ECHO model uses telehealth technology to link subject matter experts at an academic hub
  with community health workers in rural and medically underserved areas of South Texas, providing training
  on opioid use disorder and behavioral health integration that increases CHW knowledge above baseline
  levels.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism addresses structural healthcare access barriers in medically underserved
    areas. Rather than blaming individuals for lack of substance use disorder treatment, it recognizes
    that geographic maldistribution of healthcare specialists creates systemic gaps in care. The intervention
    builds community-level capacity by training frontline workers who can bridge the gap between specialized
    knowledge centers and underserved populations. Equity implications: Rural and border communities in
    South Texas face compounded disadvantages including provider shortages and limited access to behavioral
    health services, disproportionately affecting Latino/Hispanic populations.'
