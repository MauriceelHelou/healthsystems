- 'Step 1: Telemedicine consultations provide addiction medicine expertise to primary care settings where
  patients already receive care'
- 'Step 2: Consultations help identify patients appropriate for specialty addiction treatment'
- 'Step 3: Consultants facilitate warm handoffs and referral coordination to specialty treatment programs'
- 'Step 4: Reduced barriers to specialty treatment referral increase patient initiation of specialty addiction
  treatment'

description: Patients receiving telemedicine consultations showed higher specialty treatment initiation
  rates (34.4%) compared to non-recipients (19.7%, p<0.05). This suggests telemedicine consultations can
  bridge the gap between primary care identification and specialty treatment engagement.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural fragmentation between primary care and
    specialty addiction treatment systems. The intervention creates a pathway that addresses system-level
    barriers including lack of referral coordination, limited PCP knowledge of specialty services, and
    disconnection between healthcare settings. The finding that few people with AUD receive treatment
    reflects healthcare system failures, not individual patient deficits.
