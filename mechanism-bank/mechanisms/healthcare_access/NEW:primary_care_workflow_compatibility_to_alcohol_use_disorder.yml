- 'Step 1: Existing primary care workflows and visit structures are not designed for AUD assessment and
  treatment'
- 'Step 2: Time constraints and competing clinical priorities limit provider capacity for AUD intervention'
- 'Step 3: AUD pharmacotherapy requires follow-up and monitoring that disrupts standard visit patterns'
- 'Step 4: Incompatibility reduces provider willingness and ability to address AUD'
- 'Step 5: Patients with AUD in primary care settings go unidentified or untreated'

description: The structural incompatibility between standard primary care workflows and the requirements
  of AUD pharmacotherapy creates a barrier to treatment access. Primary care visit structures, time allocations,
  and care processes were not designed to accommodate substance use disorder treatment, leaving patients
  with AUD without access to evidence-based care even when presenting to healthcare settings.

  variation_notes: Site-specific barriers included limited priority of addressing AUD in primary care
    and limited available resources, varying across the three VHA facilities studied

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how healthcare delivery system design creates barriers
    to care access. The issue is not patient help-seeking behavior but rather how healthcare institutions
    have organized care delivery in ways that exclude certain conditions from routine treatment. Redesigning
    primary care to integrate AUD treatment requires structural changes to visit lengths, reimbursement
    models, and care team composition.
