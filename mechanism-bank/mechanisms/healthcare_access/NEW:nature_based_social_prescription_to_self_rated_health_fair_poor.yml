  restoration'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to mental healthcare by integrating
    nature-based approaches into formal healthcare systems. It recognizes that access to nature and green/blue
    spaces is often inequitably distributed, with lower-income and minority communities having less access.
    Social prescribing creates structured pathways for populations who might otherwise lack access to
    therapeutic natural environments.
