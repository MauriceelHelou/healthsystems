  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the fragmented healthcare delivery system for OUD treatment,
    where siloed psychosocial and medical services create barriers. The structural intervention changes
    the relationship between service types from sequential/prerequisite to collaborative, addressing system-level
    fragmentation rather than individual provider behavior.
