mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carvedilol, a non-selective β-blocker with intrinsic vasodilatory activity,
  is administered to patients with compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant
  portal hypertension (CSPH)'
- 'Step 2: The vasodilatory properties of carvedilol ameliorate hepatic vascular resistance,
  which is a major mechanism of portal hypertension in early cirrhosis'
- 'Step 3: Reduction in portal pressure prevents the transition from compensated to
  decompensated cirrhosis, reducing risk of decompensating events'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of decompensation maintains better overall health status and
  reduces complications associated with advanced liver disease'
- 'Step 5: Improved survival outcomes result from maintaining compensated status,
  as decompensated cirrhosis is associated with markedly reduced life expectancy'

description: Carvedilol therapy reduces all-cause mortality in patients with compensated
  cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension. The medication's unique
  vasodilatory properties reduce hepatic vascular resistance and portal pressure,
  preventing decompensation of cirrhosis. Since the transition from compensated to
  decompensated cirrhosis is associated with markedly reduced life expectancy, preventing
  this progression through carvedilol therapy significantly improves survival outcomes.
