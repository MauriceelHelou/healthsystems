direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital therapeutic platforms provide continuous access to lifestyle intervention support without
  requiring physical healthcare facility visits'
- 'Step 2: Removal of traditional barriers (transportation, time constraints, provider availability) increases
  intervention engagement and completion'
- 'Step 3: Sustained engagement with digital coaching and monitoring enables achievement of clinically
  meaningful weight loss thresholds'
- 'Step 4: 33% of patients achieve ≥5% body weight loss, which is the threshold associated with metabolic
  health improvements'

  equity_implications: The 3-fold increased likelihood of achieving clinically significant weight loss
    through digital therapeutics highlights how structural healthcare delivery models impact health outcomes.
    Traditional models requiring in-person visits create systematic barriers for working populations,
    rural residents, and those without reliable transportation. Digital delivery models can reduce these
    structural inequities, though differential access to broadband internet and digital devices may create
    new equity concerns that require attention.
