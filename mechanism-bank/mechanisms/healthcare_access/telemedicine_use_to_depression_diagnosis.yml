description: The integrated telemedicine AUD intervention produced significant reductions in depressive
  symptom severity (t[22]=5.39, p<0.001), with symptoms decreasing from the moderately severe range at
  baseline to the mild range at treatment-end, demonstrating the mental health co-benefits of accessible
  integrated behavioral health treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural barriers to behavioral health care perpetuate
    comorbid mental health conditions. By addressing AUD and depression simultaneously through an accessible
    telehealth platform, the intervention circumvents the fragmented care system that often fails to address
    co-occurring disorders. This is particularly relevant for populations facing mental health provider
    shortages.
