direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinicians lack confidence or training in prescribing AUD pharmacotherapy despite evidence
  of efficacy'
- 'Step 2: Reluctance to prescribe leads to underutilization of available FDA-approved and off-label medications'
- 'Step 3: Patients with AUD receive psychosocial intervention alone, which has higher relapse rates'
- 'Step 4: Population-level medication treatment rates for substance use disorders remain low'

description: Clinician reluctance to prescribe AUD medications represents a critical healthcare system
  barrier. Despite medications being efficacious, safe, and cost-effective, provider-level hesitancy creates
  a treatment gap that disproportionately affects AUD patients who could benefit from pharmacological
  support.

    not explicitly quantified

  strength: moderate
  description: Outpatient settings may have less infrastructure for managing AUD pharmacotherapy, increasing
    reluctance
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies the structural barrier as residing in the healthcare
    delivery system and medical education, not in patient characteristics. The reluctance is framed as
    a clinician/system issue that requires intervention through education, guidelines, and systems change
    rather than patient-focused interventions.
