to_node:
  node_id: suicidal_ideation

direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intravenous racemic ketamine is administered to patients experiencing suicidal
  ideation, typically in clinical/hospital settings'
- 'Step 2: Ketamine acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist and modulates glutamatergic
  neurotransmission, producing rapid neurobiological effects'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes result in rapid reduction of suicidal ideation
  within 72 hours of administration'
- 'Step 4: The effect is superior to control drugs (placebo or midazolam) with minor
  and transient adverse events'

description: Systematic review evidence demonstrates that intravenous racemic ketamine
  produces rapid reduction in suicidal ideation within 72 hours compared to control
  drugs. The treatment shows a favorable short-term benefit-risk balance with minor
  and transient adverse events. However, evidence is limited to short-term effects,
  primarily in patients with affective disorders, and mechanisms of action on suicidal
  ideation remain incompletely understood.
