description: ROM feedback improves global functioning outcomes in AOD treatment, identified as one of
  the secondary outcomes improved in 4 of 6 good/fair quality studies
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Focus on global functioning acknowledges that substance use disorders exist within
    broader social contexts including employment, housing, and relationships. ROM systems that track comprehensive
    outcomes support holistic treatment approaches that address structural factors affecting recovery.
