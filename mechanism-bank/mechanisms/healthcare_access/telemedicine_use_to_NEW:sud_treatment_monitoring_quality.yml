description: Telehealth adoption for SUD treatment creates limitations in treatment monitoring capacity,
  particularly the inability to conduct urine drug screens and gather comprehensive client information
  that would be available through in-person encounters.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 25

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural trade-off in telehealth policy implementation
    - increased access may come at the cost of monitoring fidelity. This reflects healthcare system capacity
    constraints rather than individual client behaviors. The information-sharing challenges between DOC
    and treatment providers highlight inter-agency structural barriers.
