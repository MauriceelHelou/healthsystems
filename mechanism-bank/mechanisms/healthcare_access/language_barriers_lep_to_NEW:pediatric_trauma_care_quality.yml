- 'Step 1: Limited English proficiency creates communication barriers in emergency and trauma care settings'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate interpreter services may lead to incomplete history and miscommunication'
- 'Step 3: Language barriers may affect informed consent and shared decision-making'
- 'Step 4: Potential for suboptimal trauma care and follow-up due to communication gaps'

    care rather than blaming families for language differences. The responsibility is on systems to ensure
    equitable access regardless of language.
