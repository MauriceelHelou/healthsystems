direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Baclofen, a GABA-B receptor agonist, is prescribed at doses up to 50-60 mg/day for alcohol
  use disorder treatment'
- 'Step 2: GABA-B receptor activation modulates mesolimbic dopamine pathways involved in alcohol reward
  and reinforcement'
- 'Step 3: Reduced dopaminergic signaling in reward circuits decreases the reinforcing properties of alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience increased ability to maintain abstinence from alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Higher percent days abstinent reflects improved AUD treatment outcomes'

description: Baclofen at doses up to 50-60 mg/day increases percent days abstinent in patients with alcohol
  use disorder, representing a medication-assisted treatment approach that addresses the neurobiological
  underpinnings of AUD rather than relying solely on behavioral interventions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of healthcare system access to evidence-based
    pharmacotherapy for AUD. Treatment availability is a structural determinant - disparities in access
    to addiction medicine specialists, insurance coverage for AUD medications, and healthcare system capacity
    to prescribe and monitor baclofen therapy can create inequities in treatment outcomes. The focus on
    optimal dosing provides guidance that can improve standardization of care across healthcare settings.
