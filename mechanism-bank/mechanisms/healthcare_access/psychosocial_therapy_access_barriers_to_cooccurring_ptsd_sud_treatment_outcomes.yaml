mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychosocial therapies are currently the only specifically recommended
  treatments for co-occurring PTSD and SUD'
- 'Step 2: These therapies come with numerous barriers to access and engagement (e.g.,
  geographic distance, cost, time requirements, stigma, limited provider availability)'
- 'Step 3: Barriers prevent individuals with co-occurring PTSD and SUD from receiving
  evidence-based treatment'
- 'Step 4: Lack of treatment access leads to worse health outcomes in this population'
