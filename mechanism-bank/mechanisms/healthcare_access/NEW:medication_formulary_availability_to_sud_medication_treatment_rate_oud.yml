direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited number of approved/available medications for alcohol dependence restricts treatment
  options'
- 'Step 2: Different medications work for different patient populations; limited options reduce likelihood
  of finding effective treatment'
- 'Step 3: Availability of substitution therapy options (e.g., GHB in Italy) expands the pool of treatable
  patients'
- 'Step 4: Greater medication variety enables personalized treatment matching and higher overall utilization'

description: The range of medications approved and available for alcohol dependence treatment varies by
  jurisdiction. Greater medication availability, including substitution therapies like GHB, enables higher
  treatment rates.

  description: Regulatory decisions about which medications are approved and available directly determine
    treatment options
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Medication availability is determined by regulatory policy and healthcare system
    decisions, not individual choices. This mechanism shows how pharmaceutical policy directly shapes
    treatment access and outcomes.
