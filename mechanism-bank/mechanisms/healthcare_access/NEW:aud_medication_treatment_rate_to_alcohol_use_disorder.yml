mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD pharmacotherapy (naltrexone, acamprosate) is prescribed to patients in residential treatment'
- 'Step 2: Medications reduce alcohol craving and/or block rewarding effects of alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Reduced drinking and improved treatment outcomes during and after residential stay'
- 'Step 4: Decreased AUD severity and relapse rates'

description: Evidence-based AUD pharmacotherapy reduces alcohol use disorder severity and improves treatment
  outcomes among patients in residential programs
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Receipt of pharmacotherapy varies widely across VA residential programs, creating geographic
    disparities in treatment outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism links structural barriers to health outcomes. Veterans in VA residential
    treatment represent a severe AUD population requiring intensive care; structural barriers to pharmacotherapy
    create inequitable outcomes. Military veterans face elevated AUD prevalence, making structural facilitators
    particularly important for this population.
