direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited access to physicians who can prescribe alcohol dependence medications creates bottleneck
  in care'
- 'Step 2: Patients without access to prescribers cannot initiate or maintain pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 3: Geographic and temporal access barriers (office hours availability) determine treatment feasibility'
- 'Step 4: Improved physician access enables higher rates of medication prescribing and treatment initiation'

description: Access to physicians who prescribe alcohol dependence medications is a critical structural
  determinant of treatment rates. When patients have ready access to prescribers during office hours,
  medication utilization increases.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights healthcare system organization as a structural barrier.
    The availability and geographic distribution of prescribers is a system-level issue requiring policy
    solutions, not individual patient behavior change.
