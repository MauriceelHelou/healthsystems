direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community pharmacy model provides accessible, supervised administration of injectable opioid
  agonists'
- 'Step 2: Pharmaceutical-grade opioid agonists bind to mu-opioid receptors, providing stable receptor
  occupancy'
- 'Step 3: Consistent receptor activation reduces neurobiological craving signals associated with opioid
  withdrawal'
- 'Step 4: 45% of participants report reduction in opioid cravings'

description: Injectable opioid agonist treatment delivered through community pharmacies reduces self-reported
  opioid cravings in nearly half of participants, addressing a key driver of continued illicit use.

  sample_size: 51
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Craving reduction through accessible medication treatment recognizes opioid use
    disorder as a medical condition requiring evidence-based pharmacological intervention rather than
    willpower alone. The community pharmacy model addresses structural treatment gaps.
