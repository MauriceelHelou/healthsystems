mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal
  cortex (DLPFC)'
- 'Step 2: Stimulation modulates neural circuits involved in executive function and reward processing'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol cue-reactivity in brain regions including insula and thalamus'
- 'Step 4: Decreased anhedonia symptoms improve mood regulation'
- 'Step 5: Lower likelihood of relapse within 3 months post-treatment'

description: Active iTBS to the left DLPFC reduced the likelihood of alcohol relapse within 3 months compared
  to sham treatment, with an odds ratio of 12.0 indicating substantially lower relapse risk in the treatment
  group (n=8) versus sham group (n=9).

  description: Study specifically recruited veterans with AUD, who may have unique treatment needs and
    responses due to military service-related factors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare access and availability of novel evidence-based
    treatments for AUD. Veterans represent a population with elevated AUD risk due to structural factors
    including combat exposure, reintegration challenges, and service-related trauma. The development and
    accessibility of effective treatments like iTBS could address health inequities if made available
    through VA healthcare systems. However, access to specialized neuromodulation treatments may be limited
    by geographic availability, healthcare infrastructure, and insurance coverage.
