mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency department screening identifies patients with hazardous drinking patterns before
  progression to severe AUD'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention provides education on health consequences and personalized risk assessment'
- 'Step 3: Motivational interviewing techniques help patients identify reasons for changing drinking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Patients may reduce consumption intensity and frequency of heavy drinking episodes'
- 'Step 5: Very small reductions in consumption may prevent some cases of progression to clinical AUD'

description: Brief interventions in emergency care settings produce very small reductions in alcohol consumption
  measures including quantity, intensity, and number of heavy drinking episodes. These small reductions
  may contribute to reduced risk of developing alcohol use disorder, though the clinical significance
  of such small effect sizes is questionable for population-level prevention.

  description: Effects were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up with no clear pattern of decay or
    strengthening over time reported
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that more intensive interventions provide no additional benefit over
    shorter approaches suggests that individual-level healthcare interventions have limited capacity to
    address alcohol-related harm at the population level. This points to the need for structural interventions
    addressing availability, pricing, and marketing of alcohol rather than relying primarily on healthcare-based
    behavior change strategies. The modest effects may reflect the reality that alcohol consumption is
    shaped by broader social and economic determinants that brief clinical encounters cannot meaningfully
    address.
