mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice system involvement results in referral to substance use treatment programs'
- 'Step 2: Justice system referrals are predominantly directed to abstinence-based programs rather than
  evidence-based medication treatment'
- 'Step 3: Fewer than 6% of criminal justice-referred cases receive opioid agonist treatment (OAT)'
- 'Step 4: Lack of OAT access leads to reduced treatment retention and higher relapse rates'
- 'Step 5: Reduced access to effective treatment perpetuates the cycle of substance use and re-incarceration'

description: Criminal justice referral to substance use treatment creates a structural barrier to evidence-based
  opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Despite strong evidence that OAT is effective in reducing overdose,
  increasing treatment retention, and improving physical health outcomes, fewer than 6% of criminal justice-referred
  cases received OAT as part of their treatment plan. This represents a systemic failure to integrate
  criminal justice with public health approaches to substance use disorder.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies how the criminal justice system's approach to substance
    use disorder creates structural barriers to effective healthcare. The punitive orientation of the
    justice system toward abstinence-based treatment rather than evidence-based medication treatment reflects
    systemic stigma against medication-assisted treatment. This structural barrier disproportionately
    affects already marginalized populations who are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, perpetuating
    health disparities. The solution requires policy-level integration of criminal justice and public
    health systems rather than individual-level interventions.
