direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care providers lack knowledge about AUD pharmacotherapy options and efficacy'
- 'Step 2: Providers hold negative beliefs about medications for AUD treatment'
- 'Step 3: Limited training and clinical support systems reduce provider confidence in prescribing'
- 'Step 4: Patients with AUD do not receive evidence-based pharmacotherapy despite presenting to primary
  care'
- 'Step 5: Treatment gap persists with only 7.8% of individuals with AUD receiving any treatment'

description: Healthcare system barriers including provider knowledge gaps, negative beliefs about AUD
  pharmacotherapy, and incompatibility with existing primary care processes create structural obstacles
  to delivering evidence-based AUD treatment, perpetuating the treatment gap where only 7.8% of individuals
  with AUD receive treatment.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 7.8
    type: percentage_change
  sample_size: 24
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study conducted across three large Veterans Health Administration facilities with site-specific
    barriers identified, suggesting geographic and organizational variation in implementation challenges
moderators:
- name: leadership_support
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Site-level leadership support interacted with pre-implementation barriers to drive implementation
    outcomes
- name: provider_turnover
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Provider turnover at sites likely negatively impacted implementation success regardless
    of pre-implementation barrier identification
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural healthcare system failures rather than patient
    non-compliance. The barriers are embedded in healthcare organization (workflow incompatibility), medical
    education (limited provider knowledge), professional culture (negative attitudes toward AUD patients),
    and resource allocation (limited implementation resources). These are systemic issues requiring organizational
    and policy interventions, not individual behavior change.
