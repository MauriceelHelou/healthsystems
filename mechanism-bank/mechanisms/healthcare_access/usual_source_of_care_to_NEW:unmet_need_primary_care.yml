mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Having a family physician establishes an ongoing care relationship and access point'
- 'Step 2: Established patients have easier access to appointments and continuity of care'
- 'Step 3: Family physicians provide care coordination and navigation support'
- 'Step 4: Regular relationship allows for proactive management of health needs'
- 'Step 5: Accessible ongoing care reduces accumulation of unmet primary care needs'

description: Having a family physician is protective against unmet primary care needs, demonstrating the
  importance of healthcare system structure in ensuring accessible care.

  variation_notes: Geographic variation in primary care physician availability may affect the protective
    effect of having a usual source of care

  description: Higher physician density in an area may increase likelihood of finding and retaining a
    family physician
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This protective mechanism reflects healthcare system infrastructure rather than
    individual choice. The availability of family physicians is determined by training programs, geographic
    distribution policies, and healthcare funding - all structural factors. Populations without access
    to family physicians face structural barriers to establishing care relationships.
