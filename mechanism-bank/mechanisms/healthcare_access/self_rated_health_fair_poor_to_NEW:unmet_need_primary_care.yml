mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Better perceived health status correlates with lower frequency of healthcare needs'
- 'Step 2: Fewer healthcare needs means fewer opportunities for needs to go unmet'
- 'Step 3: Lower healthcare utilization requirements reduce system navigation burden'
- 'Step 4: Simpler healthcare needs are more easily met within existing system capacity'
- 'Step 5: Overall lower demand results in lower rates of unmet primary care needs'

description: Better perceived health is associated with lower unmet primary care needs, reflecting that
  those with greater health needs face more challenges in having those needs met by the healthcare system.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This inverse relationship suggests the healthcare system is better suited to serve
    those with fewer and simpler needs. Those with complex health challenges face structural barriers
    that compound their vulnerability. This represents an equity concern where the most vulnerable populations
    face the greatest access barriers.
