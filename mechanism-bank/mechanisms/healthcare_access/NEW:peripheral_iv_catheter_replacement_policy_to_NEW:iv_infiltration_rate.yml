direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Routine replacement policy mandates catheter changes at fixed intervals'
- 'Step 2: Newer catheters may have better vessel wall integrity and less mechanical irritation'
- 'Step 3: Reduced time for catheter dislodgement or vessel wall erosion'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of fluid extravasation into surrounding tissues'

description: 'Routine replacement probably reduces infiltration compared with clinically-indicated change
  (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.26). Infiltration rates: routine replacement 747/3638 (20.5%) vs clinically-indicated
  834/3485 (23.9%)'

    infiltration but at increased cost and patient discomfort. Decision-making must weigh clinical significance
    of infiltration against resource utilization.'
