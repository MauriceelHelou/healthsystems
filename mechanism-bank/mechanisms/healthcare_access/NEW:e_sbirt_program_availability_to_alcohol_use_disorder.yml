description: The review found no consensus regarding effectiveness of e-SBIRT for addictive disorders
  including alcohol use disorder. While short-term reductions in drinking frequency were demonstrated,
  these did not translate to benefits for abstinence or other clinically meaningful treatment outcomes.
  The mechanism from intervention to disorder reduction remains theoretically plausible but empirically
  unsupported.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol use disorder reflects complex interactions of genetic, psychological, and
    structural factors including alcohol availability, marketing exposure, social norms, and socioeconomic
    stress. Technology-based screening and brief intervention represents a healthcare system response
    that may expand access but does not address upstream structural determinants. The concentration of
    research on 'higher-risk substance use' without addressing root causes of risk reflects a medical
    model approach rather than structural intervention. Addressing health equity requires complementing
    individual-level interventions with policy changes affecting alcohol pricing, availability, and marketing.
