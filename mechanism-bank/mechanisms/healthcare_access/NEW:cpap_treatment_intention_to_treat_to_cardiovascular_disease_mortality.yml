mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease are randomized to CPAP vs
  usual care'
- 'Step 2: Low average adherence (mean 3.1 hours/day) in CPAP group limits therapeutic exposure'
- 'Step 3: Insufficient treatment duration fails to adequately prevent nocturnal hypoxemia and sympathetic
  activation'
- 'Step 4: Persistent pathophysiological effects of poorly controlled OSA continue despite treatment assignment'
- 'Step 5: No meaningful difference in cardiovascular event risk observed between groups'

description: In intention-to-treat analysis, assignment to CPAP treatment showed no effect on major adverse
  cardiac and cerebrovascular events compared to usual care (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87-1.17). This null finding
  is attributed to suboptimal treatment adherence in the CPAP group, with mean use of only 3.1 hours/day,
  below the 4-hour threshold associated with cardiovascular benefit.

  description: Low mean adherence of 3.1 hours/day in the treatment group explains null findings; adherence
    below therapeutic threshold negates potential benefits
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'The null intention-to-treat result underscores that healthcare interventions cannot
    be evaluated in isolation from structural factors affecting implementation. Poor CPAP adherence reflects
    systemic issues including: inadequate patient education and training, limited access to mask fitting
    and troubleshooting support, financial barriers to equipment maintenance and replacement, and insufficient
    follow-up within healthcare systems. These structural barriers disproportionately affect vulnerable
    populations, potentially widening health disparities even when treatments are nominally available.'
