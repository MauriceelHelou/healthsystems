mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to multiple-session combined psychosocial interventions (MI-CBT) provides sustained
  therapeutic engagement'
- 'Step 2: Motivational interviewing addresses ambivalence and enhances intrinsic motivation for behavior
  change'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive behavioral therapy components address maladaptive thought patterns and coping skills'
- 'Step 4: Multiple sessions allow for skill reinforcement, relapse prevention planning, and therapeutic
  relationship development'
- 'Step 5: Reduced harmful alcohol consumption as measured by AUDIT score improvement'

description: 'Combined motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy delivered in multiple
  face-to-face sessions (MI-CBT/Mult/F2F) demonstrated the greatest effectiveness in reducing harmful
  alcohol consumption compared to usual care, with an AUDIT score mean difference of -4.98 (95% CI: -7.04
  to -2.91). This intervention ranked highest in SUCRA analysis (91.3) and remained the top-ranked intervention
  in sensitivity analyses.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of healthcare system capacity to deliver
    intensive, multi-session psychosocial interventions. Access to such services is structurally determined
    by healthcare funding, insurance coverage, treatment facility availability, and workforce capacity.
    Populations with limited access to behavioral health services due to geographic, economic, or systemic
    barriers may be unable to receive the most effective treatment approaches, perpetuating alcohol-related
    health inequities. The evidence supports investment in healthcare infrastructure that enables delivery
    of intensive combined psychosocial interventions rather than relying solely on brief single-session
    approaches.
