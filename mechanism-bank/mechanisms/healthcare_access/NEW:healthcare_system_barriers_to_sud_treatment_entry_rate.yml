  description: Class intersects with race and gender to compound access barriers for African-American
    women
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The review highlights that while personal barriers were more frequently documented,
    structural and systemic barriers (access and system-related) also exist and require attention. The
    explicit call to consider intersectionality of race, gender, and class acknowledges that these barriers
    are structurally produced rather than individual deficits.
