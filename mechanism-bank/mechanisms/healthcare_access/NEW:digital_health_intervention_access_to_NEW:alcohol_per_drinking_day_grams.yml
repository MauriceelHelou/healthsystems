mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions provide real-time monitoring of consumption amounts'
- 'Step 2: Feedback mechanisms help users set and track drink limits per occasion'
- 'Step 3: Strategies for pacing, alternating with non-alcoholic beverages, and recognizing intoxication
  are delivered'
- 'Step 4: Reduced quantity consumed on days when drinking occurs'

description: 'Digital interventions reduce alcohol consumption per drinking day by approximately 3.89
  grams (95% CI: 0.40-7.38). The wider confidence interval suggests greater heterogeneity across studies
  for this outcome. Notably, this effect was not observed in the student subpopulation.'

  description: No significant reduction in quantity per drinking day was observed among students specifically,
    unlike other outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This outcome reflects harm reduction on drinking occasions, which is important
    for reducing acute alcohol-related harms like injuries and violence. The lack of effect in students
    may reflect different drinking patterns (e.g., social binge drinking) that require tailored intervention
    approaches. This highlights the need for structurally-informed interventions that account for context-specific
    drinking cultures.
