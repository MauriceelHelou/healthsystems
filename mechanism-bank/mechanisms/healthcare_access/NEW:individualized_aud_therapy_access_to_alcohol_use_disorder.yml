structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to individualized therapy is mediated by structural factors including insurance
    coverage, mental health provider density, and socioeconomic resources. Patient barriers noted in the
    abstract (cost, transportation, time) reflect structural inequities in healthcare access rather than
    individual motivation failures.
