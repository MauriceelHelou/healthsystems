mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital therapeutic platforms deliver lifestyle intervention programs remotely, removing geographic
  and scheduling barriers inherent to traditional in-person programs'
- 'Step 2: Increased accessibility enables consistent engagement with dietary modification and physical
  activity guidance regardless of location or healthcare resource availability'
- 'Step 3: Sustained behavioral support through digital platforms promotes adherence to weight loss interventions
  over 4-24 month periods'
- 'Step 4: Consistent lifestyle modification results in clinically significant body weight reduction in
  patients with metabolic dysfunction'

moderators:
- name: intervention_duration
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Interventions ranged from 4 to 24 months, with longer durations potentially allowing for
    greater weight loss

  description: Mean BMI of 33.2 kg/m² indicates obese population where digital therapeutics showed effectiveness
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to healthcare access. Traditional
    in-person lifestyle counseling programs are resource-heavy and often inaccessible to populations in
    healthcare deserts, those with inflexible work schedules, or those facing transportation barriers.
    Digital therapeutics represent a scalable intervention that can reduce health inequities by democratizing
    access to evidence-based weight management programs regardless of geographic location or socioeconomic
    constraints.
