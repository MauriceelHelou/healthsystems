direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) lack stable housing, which creates
  barriers to accessing primary care and preventive health services'
- 'Step 2: Without regular healthcare access, PEH rely on Emergency Departments as
  their only or primary source of healthcare'
- 'Step 3: High rates of substance use disorders, mental health conditions, and injury
  among PEH create acute healthcare needs requiring emergency care'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related diagnoses (up to one-third of visits) and substance poisoning
  (up to one-quarter of visits) drive frequent ED presentations'
- 'Step 5: Lack of integrated discharge pathways between health, housing, and social
  care leads to repeat ED visits rather than community-based care'

description: Persons experiencing homelessness use Emergency Departments at substantially
  higher rates than the general population (rate ratio 1.63 to 18.75), with PEH making
  an average of 0.72 to 5.8 visits per person per year. This elevated usage stems
  from ED serving as the only accessible source of healthcare for this population,
  combined with high rates of acute conditions including substance use disorders,
  alcohol-related illness, and injuries that require emergency care.
