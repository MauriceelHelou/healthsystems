direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with chronic noncancer pain receive opioid prescriptions as part
  of pain management protocols'
- 'Step 2: Long-term opioid use leads to tolerance development, potentially requiring
  higher doses for pain relief'
- 'Step 3: Higher doses and prolonged exposure increase the risk of respiratory depression
  and accidental overdose'
- 'Step 4: Some patients may develop opioid use disorder, leading to misuse of prescribed
  opioids or transition to illicit opioids'
- 'Step 5: Overdose events occur due to excessive opioid accumulation, drug interactions,
  or use of high-potency opioids'

description: This meta-analysis of 13 cohorts (n=6,029,810) found a pooled overdose
  crude mortality rate of 1.1 per 1000 person-years among people prescribed opioids,
  with substantial heterogeneity across studies. The all-cause mortality rate was
  28.8 per 1000 person-years. The review highlights methodological limitations in
  ascertaining opioid indications and exposure levels, complicating precise risk estimation.
