- 'Step 1: Availability of both digital and face-to-face CBT options increases treatment modality choices'
- 'Step 2: Patient-treatment matching based on preferences and circumstances improves engagement'
- 'Step 3: Digital option reduces logistical barriers that contribute to treatment dropout'
- 'Step 4: Flexibility in treatment delivery accommodates diverse life circumstances'
- 'Step 5: Better treatment fit leads to improved retention and reduced dropout rates'

description: The availability of multiple treatment delivery modalities (digital and face-to-face CBT)
  may improve treatment retention by allowing better patient-treatment matching based on individual circumstances
  and preferences.

  description: Lower SES populations may face barriers to both modalities - transportation costs for face-to-face,
    technology costs for digital
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment system design that offers multiple evidence-based modalities addresses
    structural inequities in access. Policy decisions about insurance coverage for digital health interventions,
    telehealth parity laws, and broadband infrastructure investment all influence whether patients can
    exercise meaningful choice in treatment modality. A health equity approach requires ensuring both
    modalities are accessible across socioeconomic and geographic contexts.
