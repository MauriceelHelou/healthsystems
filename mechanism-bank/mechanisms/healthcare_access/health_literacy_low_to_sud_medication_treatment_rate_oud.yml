direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low health literacy limits ability to evaluate and appraise opioid medication-related online
  information'
- 'Step 2: Difficulty understanding treatment options and benefits of medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 3: Reduced capacity to navigate complex healthcare systems and insurance requirements'
- 'Step 4: Decreased likelihood of seeking and engaging with evidence-based OUD treatment'

description: Health literacy deficits impair the capacity of individuals to appraise opioid medication-related
  online information, contributing to underutilization of effective OUD treatment

  description: Digital access interacts with health literacy - those with both low health literacy and
    limited digital access face compounded barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Health literacy is shaped by educational access, language barriers, and systemic
    failures in health communication design. The mechanism recognizes that information accessibility is
    a structural issue requiring system-level interventions rather than individual education alone.
