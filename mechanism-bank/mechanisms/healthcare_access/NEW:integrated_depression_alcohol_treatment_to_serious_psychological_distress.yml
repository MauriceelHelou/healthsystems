description: Integrated treatment approaches delivered digitally address the structural gap in coordinated
  care for comorbid mental health and substance use conditions, producing modest but significant reductions
  in psychological distress.

  description: Quality of evidence was moderate for most outcomes but low for depressive symptoms at 6-month
    follow-up, indicating need for more high-quality trials
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism addresses the structural fragmentation of behavioral health services
    where mental health and substance use treatment systems often operate separately despite high rates
    of co-occurrence. Digital delivery reduces structural barriers including transportation, time off
    work, childcare needs, and provider availability that disproportionately affect low-income and rural
    populations. The moderate evidence quality highlights structural underinvestment in rigorous research
    for integrated treatment approaches.
