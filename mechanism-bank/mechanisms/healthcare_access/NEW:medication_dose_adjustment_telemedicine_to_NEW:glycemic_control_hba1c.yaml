direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telemedicine platforms enable remote communication between healthcare providers
  and patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, allowing for real-time data sharing
  and consultation'
- 'Step 2: Providers use transmitted glucose monitoring data and clinical information
  to make timely medication dose adjustments (insulin titration) without requiring
  in-person visits'
- 'Step 3: More frequent and responsive medication adjustments optimize insulin dosing,
  reducing periods of hyperglycemia and improving overall glycemic control'
- 'Step 4: Improved glycemic control through optimized medication management results
  in lower HbA1c levels over time'

description: Telemedicine-enabled medication dose adjustment significantly reduces
  HbA1c levels in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. A meta-analysis
  of 20 RCTs found that telemedicine interventions with medication dose adjustment
  capabilities reduced HbA1c by 0.25 percentage points compared to usual care. This
  effect is driven by the ability of healthcare providers to make timely insulin dose
  modifications based on remotely transmitted glucose data, enabling more responsive
  and personalized diabetes management.
