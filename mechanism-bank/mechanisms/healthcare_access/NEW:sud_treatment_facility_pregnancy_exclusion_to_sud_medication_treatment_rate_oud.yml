- 'Step 1: Buprenorphine treatment clinics establish policies excluding pregnant patients from OUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: 48% of clinics in North Carolina refuse to treat pregnant patients, limiting available treatment
  options'
- 'Step 3: During COVID-19 pandemic, an additional 33% of previously accepting clinics stopped accepting
  pregnant patients'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment facility availability creates access barriers for pregnant individuals with
  OUD'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of medication-assisted treatment among pregnant population with opioid use disorder'

description: Buprenorphine treatment clinic policies excluding pregnant patients create structural barriers
  to OUD medication treatment. Before the pandemic, 48% of clinics refused pregnant patients; during the
  pandemic, only 34% of clinics accepted them, representing a 33% reduction in treatment access.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural policy barrier at the healthcare facility
    level that excludes a vulnerable population from evidence-based treatment. The exclusion is not due
    to individual patient choices but institutional policies that discriminate against pregnant individuals.
    This creates inequitable access to OUD treatment based on pregnancy status, with disproportionate
    impacts on populations that may already face barriers to care.
