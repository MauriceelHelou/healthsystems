category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ACA Medicaid expansion increases eligibility for low-income adults regardless
  of pregnancy or parental status, expanding insurance access before and during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Expanded coverage increases preconception Medicaid enrollment and reduces
  uninsurance rates among women of reproductive age'
- 'Step 3: Women with continuous insurance coverage are more likely to establish care
  with providers and seek prenatal care earlier in pregnancy'
- 'Step 4: Reduced insurance churn and improved coverage continuity facilitates first
  trimester prenatal care attendance, particularly among racial and ethnic minority
  populations'

description: The ACA Medicaid expansion increased Medicaid eligibility for low-income
  adults, leading to improved preconception and postpartum coverage with corresponding
  declines in uninsurance. While overall evidence for increased perinatal health care
  use was limited, some studies found reduced racial and ethnic disparities in prenatal
  visit attendance rates, suggesting the expansion facilitated earlier and more consistent
  prenatal care access particularly for underserved populations.
