direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Locally advanced breast cancer patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink tumors before
  surgery'
- 'Step 2: Mastectomy provides more complete removal of breast tissue and potentially residual microscopic
  disease compared to breast-conserving surgery'
- 'Step 3: More extensive surgical resection may reduce local recurrence risk and eliminate residual cancer
  cells'
- 'Step 4: Reduced residual disease burden contributes to improved long-term survival outcomes'

description: Meta-analysis of 10 studies (n=5018) found that mastectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
  was associated with significantly higher 5-year overall survival compared to breast-conserving surgery
  (OR 2.68, 95% CI 2.19-3.28, p<0.00001) in locally advanced breast cancer patients.

  equity_implications: This mechanism relates to healthcare system decisions about treatment protocols.
    Access to appropriate surgical care and treatment decision-making may vary by healthcare system capacity,
    insurance coverage, and geographic access to specialized oncology services. Disparities in treatment
    recommendations and access could produce inequitable survival outcomes across populations.
