direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with alcohol use disorders or heavy drinking patterns present
  to healthcare settings for alcohol-related conditions (intoxication, withdrawal,
  injuries, psychiatric comorbidities)'
- 'Step 2: These healthcare contacts occur prior to the development of alcoholic liver
  cirrhosis, representing a temporal window for intervention'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare contact provides opportunity for screening, brief intervention,
  referral to treatment (SBIRT), and sustained engagement with addiction services'
- 'Step 4: Early intervention during these contacts can reduce or cease heavy alcohol
  consumption before irreversible liver damage occurs'
- 'Step 5: Prevention of continued heavy drinking reduces cumulative liver exposure
  and prevents progression to cirrhosis'

description: A systematic review with meta-analysis of 38 studies (N=120,928) found
  that 40-61% of patients who developed alcoholic liver cirrhosis had a previous alcohol-related
  healthcare contact before their cirrhosis diagnosis. This represents a significant
  prevention opportunity, as these healthcare encounters could be leveraged to deliver
  interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption before irreversible liver damage
  occurs. Alcohol-problem cohorts were confirmed as high-risk populations with 7-16%
  developing cirrhosis over 8-12 years.
