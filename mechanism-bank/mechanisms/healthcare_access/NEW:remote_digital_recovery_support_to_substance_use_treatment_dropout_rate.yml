direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Remote/digital interventions provide ongoing recovery support accessible from home or community
  settings'
- 'Step 2: Reduced barriers to maintaining therapeutic contact during recovery period'
- 'Step 3: Continuous support availability addresses gaps between formal treatment sessions'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced engagement and connection to care reduces dropout and disengagement'
- 'Step 5: Lower treatment discontinuation and improved long-term recovery outcomes'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment dropout is often driven by structural factors including work scheduling
    conflicts, childcare responsibilities, transportation barriers, and stigma. Remote recovery support
    addresses these structural determinants of treatment engagement, potentially reducing disparities
    in treatment completion among marginalized populations.
