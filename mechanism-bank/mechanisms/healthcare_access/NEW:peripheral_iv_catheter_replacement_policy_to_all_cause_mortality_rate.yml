description: No clear difference in mortality when clinically-indicated removal was compared with routine
  removal (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.27-4.23). Evidence is of low certainty due to very serious imprecision.

  equity_implications: This critical patient outcome shows no difference between policies, suggesting
    that the less resource-intensive clinically-indicated approach does not compromise patient safety
    at the most fundamental level.
