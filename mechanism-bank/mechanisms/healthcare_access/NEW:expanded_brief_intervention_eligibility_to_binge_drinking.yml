description: Planned adaptations to expand brief intervention eligibility to include patients drinking
  at low levels who could become pregnant represent a structural approach to prevention. This population-level
  intervention approach moves beyond traditional high-risk targeting.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects a structural competency approach by addressing population-level
    risk rather than only intervening after problematic drinking develops. It recognizes that standard
    care protocols may miss opportunities for prevention among reproductive-age individuals. The approach
    avoids stigmatizing individuals with alcohol use disorders while expanding preventive care access.
