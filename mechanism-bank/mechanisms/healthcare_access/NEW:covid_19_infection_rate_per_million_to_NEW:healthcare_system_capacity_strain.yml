- 'Step 1: Higher standardized infection rates increase total number of symptomatic cases requiring care'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare facilities experience increased patient volume'
- 'Step 3: When infection severity status exceeds national health capacity thresholds, system strain occurs'
- 'Step 4: Reduced ability to provide adequate care for COVID-19 and non-COVID patients'

description: The standardized infection rate per million population can be used to determine whether current
  infectious severity exceeds national health capacity. Higher infection rates, especially when uncontrolled
  due to inadequate isolation policies, lead to healthcare system strain.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Healthcare capacity thresholds vary by country, with the standardized infection rate
    serving as an indicator of whether current infection levels exceed national capacity to provide adequate
    care.

  description: Countries with greater baseline healthcare capacity have higher thresholds before system
    strain occurs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how public health infrastructure and healthcare system
    capacity are structural determinants that mediate the relationship between policy effectiveness and
    health outcomes. Populations in countries with lower baseline healthcare capacity or delayed policy
    responses face compounded vulnerability. The analysis avoids blaming individuals for healthcare system
    failures.
