direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions provide accessible, low-barrier alcohol reduction programs via smartphones,
  websites, or apps'
- 'Step 2: Users receive personalized feedback, self-monitoring tools, and brief interventions without
  requiring in-person healthcare visits'
- 'Step 3: Increased awareness of drinking patterns and normative comparisons motivates behavior change'
- 'Step 4: Reduced frequency of heavy episodic drinking occasions'

description: Digital interventions reduce heavy episodic drinking (HED) by 1.11 fewer occasions per month
  compared to control conditions. This effect represents a population-level approach that removes traditional
  barriers to alcohol treatment access.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Digital interventions address structural barriers to alcohol treatment including
    geographic healthcare deserts, stigma associated with seeking in-person treatment, time constraints,
    and cost barriers. By providing scalable, anonymous, and free/low-cost interventions, these tools
    can reduce health inequities in alcohol treatment access. However, digital divide issues may limit
    reach to populations without reliable internet or smartphone access.
