description: This systematic review highlights the limited treatment options for substance use disorders
  and the potential role of ketamine as a novel therapeutic option. Despite global prevalence and burden
  of SUDs, treatment options remain limited, creating structural barriers to recovery.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The paper explicitly notes that 'treatment options remain limited' for SUDs despite
    their global prevalence and burden. This represents a structural failure in healthcare systems to
    adequately address addiction. Ketamine's potential as a treatment option must be evaluated in the
    context of healthcare access disparities, cost barriers, and the need for well-controlled research
    before broader implementation. The paper appropriately calls for larger studies and assessment of
    risks including abuse liability.
