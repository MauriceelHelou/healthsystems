mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief interventions are delivered in healthcare settings (primary care, emergency departments)
  during routine encounters'
- 'Step 2: Interventions typically include motivational interviewing, feedback on use patterns, and advice
  to reduce use'
- 'Step 3: Intended to increase awareness of cannabis-related risks and motivation to change'
- 'Step 4: Expected to reduce frequency of cannabis use through behavior change'
- 'Step 5: However, evidence shows no significant reduction in cannabis use days (null effect)'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that brief interventions delivered in healthcare
  settings (primarily primary care and emergency departments) did not significantly reduce the number
  of days of cannabis use in either the short-term (MD -0.22 days; 95% CI -2.27, 1.82) or long-term (MD
  -0.28 days; 95% CI -2.42, 1.86). The null effect suggests that brief interventions, which have shown
  efficacy for alcohol use, may not translate effectively to cannabis use reduction.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This finding has important implications for health equity and structural approaches
    to substance use. The null effect suggests that healthcare system-based brief interventions alone
    are insufficient to address cannabis use, potentially because: (1) cannabis use may be driven by structural
    factors (economic stress, lack of opportunity, mental health burden) that brief clinical encounters
    cannot address; (2) healthcare access disparities mean these interventions would not reach populations
    with highest need; (3) a purely individual-focused clinical approach fails to address social and environmental
    determinants of substance use. The finding argues for complementary structural interventions addressing
    root causes rather than relying solely on clinical behavior change approaches.'
