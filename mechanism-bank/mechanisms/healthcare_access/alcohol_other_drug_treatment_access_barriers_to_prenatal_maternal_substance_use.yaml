mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant women face structural barriers to substance use treatment including
  lack of pregnancy-specific programs, waitlists, cost, and stigma'
- 'Step 2: Fear of child protection involvement and punitive consequences deters mothers
  from seeking treatment during pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate treatment access, substance use continues through pregnancy'
- 'Step 4: Infants are born with prenatal substance exposure, triggering child protection
  referrals at birth (40.6% prevalence among birth referrals)'
