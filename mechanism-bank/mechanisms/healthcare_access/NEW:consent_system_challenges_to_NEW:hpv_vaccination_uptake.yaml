direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: School-based HPV vaccination programs require parental consent forms to
  be distributed, completed, and returned before vaccination can occur'
- 'Step 2: Consent forms may not reach parents due to distribution failures, language
  barriers, or adolescents failing to pass forms to caregivers'
- 'Step 3: Even when forms reach parents, they may be lost, forgotten, or not returned
  due to administrative burden or competing priorities'
- 'Step 4: Without valid consent documentation, healthcare providers cannot administer
  HPV vaccine regardless of parental intention to vaccinate'
- 'Step 5: Missed vaccination opportunities accumulate, leading to reduced overall
  HPV vaccination coverage rates'

description: Systematic review identifies challenges with obtaining consent as a system-level
  barrier to HPV vaccination uptake in the UK. The school-based vaccination program
  relies on parental consent processes that can fail at multiple points, preventing
  eligible adolescents from receiving vaccination despite parental willingness. This
  administrative barrier contributes to vaccination coverage remaining below 80% and
  below pre-COVID levels.
