mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief motivational interventions (particularly stand-alone personalized feedback) are delivered
  to college student populations'
- 'Step 2: Interventions increase protective behavioral strategy use (mediator)'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced PBS use leads to reduced harmful drinking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in alcohol-related problems (indirect/mediated effect)'
- 'Step 5: Net mediated effect is small in size on average'

description: Brief motivational interventions reduce alcohol-related problems among college students through
  the mediating pathway of increased protective behavioral strategy use. The net mediated effect across
  strategies was small in size on average, highlighting the importance of examining specific intervention
  formats.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes the role of healthcare and educational system infrastructure
    in delivering evidence-based interventions. The structural determinant is the availability and accessibility
    of BMIs within college settings. Equity implications include disparities in intervention availability
    across different types of institutions (e.g., well-resourced vs. under-resourced colleges, availability
    of campus health services).
