description: The review emphasizes the importance of systematized screening as a prerequisite for effective
  brief intervention delivery. The review aimed to identify optimal strategies for systematic screening
  that can be deployed in emergency rooms to connect at-risk drinkers with appropriate interventions.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Systematic screening represents a healthcare system infrastructure change that
    removes the burden of self-identification from patients. This structural approach ensures that alcohol
    use screening becomes a routine part of care rather than dependent on individual patient disclosure
    or clinician judgment, which may be influenced by biases related to race, class, or appearance. Implementation
    of systematic screening protocols is an equity-promoting intervention when applied universally across
    patient populations.
