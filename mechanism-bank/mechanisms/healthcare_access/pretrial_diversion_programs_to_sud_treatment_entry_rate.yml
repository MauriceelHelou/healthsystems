mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice contact creates identification opportunity for individuals with unmet treatment
  needs'
- 'Step 2: Diversion mechanisms at arrest, court, or sentencing stages create pathways to treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Court-mandated or voluntary treatment options lower barriers to service entry'
- 'Step 4: Increased treatment engagement among population otherwise unlikely to access services'

description: Diversion programs increase treatment access for class A drug users by creating structured
  pathways from criminal justice contact to substance use treatment services. The review examined programs
  operating at all points within the criminal justice system.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Programs operate at various points within criminal justice system; UK and US systems
    differ substantially in structure and treatment availability.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how criminal justice infrastructure can either block or
    facilitate healthcare access. For marginalized populations whose primary system contact is through
    policing rather than healthcare, diversion represents a structural intervention addressing healthcare
    access inequity. Without such programs, individuals with substance use disorders face incarceration
    rather than treatment, perpetuating health disparities.
