direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Video telehealth requires digital infrastructure (broadband, devices, digital literacy)'
- 'Step 2: Older adults, Black patients, and those with certain comorbidities have reduced access to video
  technology'
- 'Step 3: Digital divide creates differential access to video versus telephone-only modalities'
- 'Step 4: Treatment modality inequities emerge along demographic and clinical lines'

description: Among patients who received any telehealth-delivered AUD treatment, older adults, Black patients,
  those with cannabis or stimulant use disorders, and those with serious mental illness were less likely
  to receive video visits compared to telephone-only, revealing digital divide disparities

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how the digital divide operates as a structural determinant
    of healthcare access. Video telehealth, while potentially offering higher-quality interaction, is
    not equitably accessible. The racial disparity (Black patients less likely to receive video) reflects
    broader structural inequities in digital infrastructure and technology access. The finding that multiple
    treatment modalities should remain available is a structural intervention to maintain equity.
