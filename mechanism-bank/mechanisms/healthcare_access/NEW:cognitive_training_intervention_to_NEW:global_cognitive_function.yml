description: Cognitive training targeting attention also improves global cognitive function (Hedges' g
  = 0.30), supporting the role of attention as foundational to broader cognitive abilities and suggesting
  transfer effects from attention training.

  equity_implications: Improving global cognitive function through accessible interventions represents
    secondary prevention that could delay progression from MCI to dementia. This has major implications
    for healthcare costs, caregiver burden, and quality of life - all of which are influenced by structural
    factors like healthcare access and social support systems.
