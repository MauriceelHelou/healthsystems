mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients on opioid agonist treatment (OAT) present with high rates of comorbid substance misuse
  that often goes unrecognized'
- 'Step 2: Implementation of systematic screening identifies co-occurring alcohol and drug misuse in OAT
  clinical settings'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention delivers structured motivational counseling that increases awareness of
  substance-related harms'
- 'Step 4: Patient engagement with brief intervention leads to behavioral modifications and reduced substance
  risk scores'
- 'Step 5: Reduced polysubstance use improves overall clinical and psychosocial outcomes for patients
  on OAT'

  of polysubstance use in OAT populations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system infrastructure and clinical practice
    integration determines access to evidence-based interventions. The finding that SBI is 'limited and
    incomplete' in OAT settings represents a structural barrier to care, not individual patient failure.
    Improving systematic screening protocols in OAT programs represents a systems-level intervention that
    could reduce health inequities among people with opioid use disorder who face multiple barriers to
    comprehensive care.
