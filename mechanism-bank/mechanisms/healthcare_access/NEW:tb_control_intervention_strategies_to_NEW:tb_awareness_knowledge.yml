  variation_notes: Studies primarily from East China; effectiveness in other regions may vary
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Health literacy and awareness are products of structural investment in education
    and outreach programs, not simply individual motivation to learn. This mechanism emphasizes the role
    of healthcare systems in creating informed communities.
