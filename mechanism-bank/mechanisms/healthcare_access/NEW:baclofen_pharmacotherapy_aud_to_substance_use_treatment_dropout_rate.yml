direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Baclofen at higher doses produces adverse effects including drowsiness, sedation, somnolence,
  and fatigue'
- 'Step 2: These side effects impair daily functioning and quality of life during treatment'
- 'Step 3: Patients may find side effects intolerable, particularly at higher doses'
- 'Step 4: Increased discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events'
- 'Step 5: Higher dropout rates compromise treatment effectiveness and recovery outcomes'

description: Higher baclofen doses increase treatment dropout due to adverse events, highlighting the
  need to balance therapeutic efficacy with tolerability. The optimal dose range of 50-60 mg/day represents
  an attempt to maximize benefits while minimizing harm.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment retention is influenced by structural factors including patient support
    systems, employment flexibility to manage side effects, access to follow-up care for dose adjustment,
    and healthcare provider expertise in managing adverse events. Patients in precarious employment or
    lacking social support may be less able to tolerate side effects, creating disparities in treatment
    retention. Healthcare system capacity for individualized dose titration and close monitoring can mitigate
    dropout risk.
