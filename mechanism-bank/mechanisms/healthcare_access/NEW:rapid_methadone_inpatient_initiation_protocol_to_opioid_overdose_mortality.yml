mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inpatient settings allow for continuous monitoring of patients during methadone initiation'
- 'Step 2: Rapid titration (30mg initial dose with 10mg daily increases to 60mg) achieves therapeutic
  levels faster than outpatient guidelines'
- 'Step 3: Faster achievement of therapeutic dose accounts for increased opioid tolerance in the fentanyl
  era'
- 'Step 4: Therapeutic methadone levels reduce illicit opioid use and craving'
- 'Step 5: Reduced illicit opioid use decreases risk of fatal overdose'

description: Rapid inpatient methadone initiation protocol (30mg initial with 10mg daily increases to
  60mg) demonstrated safety with zero in-hospital or 30-day post-discharge overdoses or deaths in 25 hospitalized
  patients with moderate to severe OUD, suggesting monitored inpatient settings can safely accelerate
  methadone titration to therapeutic doses.

  description: Hospital inpatient settings with capacity for increased monitoring enable safer rapid titration
    compared to outpatient settings
- name: fentanyl_era_tolerance
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Patients in the fentanyl era have higher opioid tolerance, making rapid titration both
    safer and more necessary to achieve therapeutic effect
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to effective OUD treatment. Traditional
    outpatient guidelines create structural delays in achieving therapeutic methadone doses, which may
    contribute to treatment dropout and continued illicit opioid use. Inpatient initiation represents
    a healthcare system-level intervention that can overcome these barriers, particularly important for
    populations with limited outpatient follow-up capacity or unstable housing. The fentanyl era has fundamentally
    changed the risk landscape, making structural adaptation of treatment protocols necessary.
