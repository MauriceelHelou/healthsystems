mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated healthcare system implements routine alcohol screening for all adult primary care
  patients'
- 'Step 2: Patients screening positive for unhealthy alcohol use receive brief intervention counseling'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention addresses motivation for change and provides information on alcohol-health
  connections'
- 'Step 4: Patients with hypertension reduce overall weekly alcohol consumption by approximately 0.30
  drinks per week'

  description: Effect significant for hypertension patients only; no significant association observed
    among type 2 diabetes patients (N=19,642)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The structural embedding of alcohol screening into routine primary care creates
    systematic opportunities for intervention that do not depend on patient self-referral. This addresses
    health equity by reaching populations who might not otherwise seek specialized substance use services.
    The lack of effect among diabetes patients suggests structural interventions may need condition-specific
    tailoring.
