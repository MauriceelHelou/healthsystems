direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile phone-based text messaging interventions deliver behavioral change messages directly
  to individuals with harmful/hazardous drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Text messages provide reminders, motivational content, and self-monitoring prompts that increase
  awareness of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Ubiquitous access to mobile phones enables reach across diverse populations regardless of geographic
  barriers to traditional healthcare'
- 'Step 4: Regular messaging engagement supports sustained behavior modification reducing frequency of
  heavy episodic drinking'

description: This protocol outlines a planned systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether
  text messaging interventions can effectively reduce alcohol consumption among harmful and hazardous
  drinkers compared to no intervention or minimal/unrelated intervention. The ubiquity of mobile phone
  technology suggests potential for broad population reach.

  description: Interventions consisting of only text messages (vs. multi-component) are the focus of this
    review to isolate text messaging effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Text messaging interventions represent a structural approach to healthcare access
    by overcoming geographic and temporal barriers to traditional alcohol intervention services. The technology's
    ubiquity means it can reach populations in healthcare deserts or those with limited transportation
    access. However, the protocol does not explicitly address how digital divide issues (broadband access,
    digital literacy) may create differential access by socioeconomic status. Equity implications include
    potential to democratize access to behavioral health support while risking exclusion of those without
    consistent mobile phone access.
