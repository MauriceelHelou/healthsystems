- 'Step 1: Most NPs/PAs believe counseling and peer support should complement buprenorphine'
- 'Step 2: Provider beliefs about mandatory psychosocial treatment may create additional access barriers'
- 'Step 3: Patients unable to access counseling may be denied buprenorphine by some providers'
- 'Step 4: Evidence shows not all buprenorphine patients require psychosocial treatment'
- 'Step 5: Inflexible psychosocial requirements can reduce overall medication treatment access'

description: Provider beliefs that counseling and peer support should always complement buprenorphine
  may create unnecessary barriers when psychosocial services are unavailable, despite evidence that such
  services are not required for all patients

  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects how professional training and clinical culture create gatekeeping
    practices that can restrict access to life-saving medication. Rigid treatment requirements often have
    greater impact on marginalized populations with fewer resources to meet additional service requirements.
    Evidence-based, low-barrier treatment approaches address structural access inequities.
