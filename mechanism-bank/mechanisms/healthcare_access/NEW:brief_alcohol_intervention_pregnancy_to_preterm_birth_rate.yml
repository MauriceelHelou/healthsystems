description: Brief alcohol interventions for pregnant women are effective in preventing preterm birth,
  likely through the mechanism of reducing prenatal alcohol exposure which is a known risk factor for
  adverse birth outcomes.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: All studies from high-income countries; generalizability to LMICs unknown
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare system interventions can prevent adverse
    birth outcomes. The structural determinant is the availability and integration of brief alcohol interventions
    into prenatal care systems. Preterm birth prevention addresses a key driver of infant morbidity and
    mortality.
