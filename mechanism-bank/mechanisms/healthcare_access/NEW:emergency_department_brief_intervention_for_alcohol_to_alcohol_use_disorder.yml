mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High prevalence of AUD among ER patients creates opportunity for secondary prevention'
- 'Step 2: Systematic screening identifies patients with or at risk for alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention provides early stage intervention before AUD progression'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in alcohol consumption prevents AUD-related damages and progression'
- 'Step 5: Decreased severity or prevention of alcohol use disorder development'

description: Emergency department brief interventions for alcohol use are designed to prevent AUD-related
  damages by identifying and intervening with at-risk drinkers. The review finds majority of studies conclude
  BI is effective, though with modest effect sizes and declining effectiveness over time. The optimal
  modalities for implementation remain to be defined.

  strength: moderate
  description: The wide variation in intervention types and methodologies makes it difficult to determine
    optimal approaches and may reduce overall effect consistency

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effect sizes differ between studies with different follow-up durations, with effectiveness
    appearing to decrease over time
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The integration of alcohol screening and brief intervention into ER care represents
    a systems-level approach to addressing AUD at a critical access point. The high prevalence of AUD
    among ER patients reflects broader structural factors including lack of accessible treatment, socioeconomic
    stressors, and inadequate community-based prevention. While BI addresses individuals, its systematic
    deployment as standard care shifts responsibility from individual help-seeking to institutional responsibility.
    Future research should examine whether BI effectiveness varies by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity,
    or insurance status to ensure equitable implementation.
