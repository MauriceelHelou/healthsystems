description: Integrated liver care models that combine hepatology services with alcohol use disorder treatment
  address structural fragmentation in healthcare delivery, potentially reducing hospitalizations for liver
  failure and cirrhosis through coordinated management of both the underlying cause (AUD) and its consequences
  (ARLD).

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural gap in healthcare system organization -
    the separation of substance use treatment from medical specialty care for its consequences. The siloed
    nature of healthcare creates barriers for patients with comorbid conditions. Integrated care models
    represent a structural intervention that reorganizes service delivery rather than expecting patients
    to navigate fragmented systems. This approach recognizes that treatment engagement failures often
    reflect system design rather than individual patient motivation deficits.
