category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with AUD develop alcohol-attributable cardiovascular diseases through chronic alcohol
  exposure'
- 'Step 2: Prescribers may perceive higher risk or complexity in treating patients with cardiovascular
  comorbidities'
- 'Step 3: Potential concerns about drug interactions or contraindications may deter pharmacotherapy initiation'
- 'Step 4: Systemic barriers in specialist care lead to underutilization of effective AUD medications'
- 'Step 5: Patients with greatest medical need receive lowest rates of evidence-based pharmacotherapy'

description: Patients with AUD and alcohol-attributable cardiovascular disease have 59% lower odds of
  receiving AUD pharmacotherapy compared to those without such comorbidities, representing substantial
  underutilization of effective treatment in high-risk populations.

  description: Presence of diagnoses which are contraindications to AUD pharmacotherapy partially but
    not fully explains the low prescription rate
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals a structural failure in healthcare systems where patients
    with the greatest medical complexity and need (those with alcohol-related organ damage) receive the
    least access to evidence-based treatment. This represents a paradox in care delivery that cannot be
    attributed to individual patient behavior but rather to systemic prescriber barriers, care fragmentation,
    and potentially inadequate clinical guidelines for complex patients.
