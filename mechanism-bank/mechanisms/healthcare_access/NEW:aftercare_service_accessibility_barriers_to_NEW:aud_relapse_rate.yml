mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals discharged from AUD treatment programs require continuing care to maintain recovery'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers (geographic access, transportation, scheduling, stigma) limit access to
  in-person aftercare interventions'
- 'Step 3: Lack of continuing care leaves individuals without support during vulnerable post-treatment
  period'
- 'Step 4: Absence of ongoing support and monitoring increases probability of relapse'

description: Relapse is common among individuals with AUD following discharge from treatment programs,
  often attributed to lack of continuing care and barriers to accessing in-person interventions. This
  structural barrier to healthcare access perpetuates the cycle of AUD relapse.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Barriers to in-person interventions likely vary significantly by geographic location,
    with rural and underserved areas having fewer treatment options and greater access barriers

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Availability of digital interventions may partially mitigate the effect of physical access
    barriers on relapse risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system structure creates inequitable outcomes.
    The concentration of addiction treatment services in urban areas, combined with transportation barriers,
    work schedule conflicts, and stigma associated with attending in-person treatment, creates structural
    obstacles that disproportionately affect low-income individuals, those in rural areas, and those facing
    employment instability. The burden of accessing care is placed on vulnerable individuals rather than
    addressed through systemic changes to service delivery models.
