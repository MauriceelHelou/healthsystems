direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High workload and understaffing in urgent/emergency care settings limits time available for
  preventive interventions'
- 'Step 2: Lack of funding for prevention programs reduces institutional capacity to implement alcohol
  screening'
- 'Step 3: Insufficient training and knowledge about SBIRT among healthcare workers creates skill barriers'
- 'Step 4: Absence of timely referral pathways prevents connection to alcohol treatment services'
- 'Step 5: Reduced early identification and intervention allows alcohol use disorders to progress untreated'

description: Structural barriers in urgent and emergency care settings including high workload, lack of
  prevention funding, inadequate training, and poor referral pathways prevent effective implementation
  of alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT), allowing alcohol use disorders
  to go unidentified and untreated.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies systemic healthcare barriers rather than individual provider
    failures. The study explicitly notes 66% of providers give brief alcohol advice but fewer screen or
    refer, indicating structural rather than motivational barriers. Workforce shortages and funding deficits
    are policy-level determinants that create inequitable access to preventive alcohol interventions.
