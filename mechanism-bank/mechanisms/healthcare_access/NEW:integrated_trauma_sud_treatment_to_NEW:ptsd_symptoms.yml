mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adults with ACE histories receive integrated psychological interventions addressing both PTSD
  and SUD'
- 'Step 2: Interventions such as Seeking Safety, exposure-based treatments, TREM, or integrated CBT target
  trauma processing and coping skills'
- 'Step 3: Treatment addresses emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic factor underlying both conditions'
- 'Step 4: Successful treatment reduces PTSD symptom severity through improved trauma processing and emotional
  regulation'

description: Integrated psychological interventions for comorbid PTSD-SUD show small to medium positive
  effects on PTSD outcomes in adults with ACE histories. Five of the included studies demonstrated positive
  effects, though overall quality was low with high clinical heterogeneity.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to integrated trauma-SUD treatment is structurally determined by healthcare
    system organization, funding for specialized services, and geographic availability of trained providers.
    High attrition reflects structural barriers including transportation, childcare, stigma, and treatment
    accessibility. The narrow range of theoretical models tested reflects research funding priorities
    and clinical practice traditions.
