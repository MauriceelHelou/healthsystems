- 'Step 1: Population-level AUD prevalence determines the prior probability of disease in screening populations'
- 'Step 2: In low-prevalence settings, even highly specific tests produce proportionally more false positives'
- 'Step 3: Higher false-positive rates increase number needed to screen (NNS) to treat one true case'
- 'Step 4: Resources are diverted to follow-up of false positives, reducing system efficiency'

description: The study calculated the number of people needed to be screened to treat one individual with
  AUD for all countries globally, demonstrating that low-prevalence populations require screening many
  more people and experience higher proportions of false positives. This has significant resource allocation
  implications for primary care screening programs.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Number of people needed to be screened to treat 1 individual with AUD was estimated
    for all countries globally using data from the Global Information System on Alcohol and Health, demonstrating
    substantial international variation.

  description: Using a specificity of 0.95 still results in varying numbers needed to screen across different
    prevalence settings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how universal screening recommendations may create structural
    inefficiencies and potential harms in certain populations. Low-prevalence populations (including women
    as a group) experience disproportionate burden from false-positive results, which can lead to unnecessary
    medical follow-up, stigma, and resource misallocation. This represents a structural healthcare policy
    issue where one-size-fits-all screening guidelines fail to account for population heterogeneity.
