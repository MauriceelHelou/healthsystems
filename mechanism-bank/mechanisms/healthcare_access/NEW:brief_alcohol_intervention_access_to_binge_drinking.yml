direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) are delivered in healthcare, educational, or community settings
  to individuals at risk for alcohol misuse'
- 'Step 2: BAIs provide personalized feedback, motivational interviewing, and normative information about
  drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Intervention recipients gain awareness of their drinking relative to peers and health risks'
- 'Step 4: This awareness and motivation leads to reduced alcohol consumption in the short-to-medium term
  (1-6 months)'
- 'Step 5: Reduced mean number of drinks consumed decreases binge drinking episodes'

description: Brief alcohol interventions produce a statistically significant 8% reduction in mean number
  of drinks at 1-3 months and 6 months post-intervention compared to controls, but this effect diminishes
  by 9-12 months. The IPD meta-analysis of 19 studies (N=7,704) used marginalized zero-inflated models
  to account for heterogeneous drinking patterns in the population.

  description: 58.5% were first-year students, suggesting college transition period may be critical window
    for intervention
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights the importance of structural access to preventive interventions
    in educational and healthcare settings. The predominantly White (74.7%), college-student sample limits
    generalizability to other populations. Equity implications include: (1) differential access to BAIs
    based on educational attainment and healthcare access; (2) interventions delivered in college settings
    may not reach non-college-attending young adults who may have higher risk; (3) the time-limited effect
    suggests need for sustained structural supports rather than one-time interventions.'
