direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care clinics are more numerous and geographically accessible than specialty OUD treatment
  centers'
- 'Step 2: Primary care settings reduce visibility and potential stigma associated with receiving OUD
  treatment'
- 'Step 3: Integrated care facilitates management of comorbid medical conditions alongside OUD treatment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced barriers to access may improve treatment initiation and continuation'
- 'Step 5: Increased accessibility may improve abstinence from non-prescribed opioids'

description: Primary care delivery of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) for OUD may result in higher abstinence
  from non-prescribed opioids compared to specialty care settings, with a risk ratio of 1.59 (95% CI 1.03-2.46)
  based on 5 studies with 428 participants. This represents low-certainty evidence.

moderators:
- name: Patient risk level
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Evidence applies primarily to lower-risk, stable OUD patients; high-risk patients (pregnant,
    co-dependence on alcohol/benzodiazepines, psychiatric illness, homeless) were excluded from studies
- name: Primary care clinic OUD experience
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Primary care providers in studies often had connections to or proximity with OUD-specialized
    clinics, which may not reflect typical primary care settings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare access barriers that create inequities in OUD
    treatment. Geographic distribution of specialty care facilities often concentrates in urban areas,
    creating access barriers for rural populations. Stigma associated with specialty OUD clinics may disproportionately
    affect marginalized communities. Integrating OAT into primary care represents a structural intervention
    to reduce treatment gaps rather than placing blame on individuals for not seeking treatment.
