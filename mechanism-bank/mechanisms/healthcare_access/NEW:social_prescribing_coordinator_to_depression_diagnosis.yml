description: Social prescribing coordinators who facilitate connections between patients and nature-based
  community programs show significant positive effects on mental health outcomes, acting as bridge between
  healthcare system and community resources.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Social prescribing coordinators address structural barriers by providing navigation
    support for patients who may face socioeconomic, transportation, or knowledge barriers to accessing
    nature-based resources. This structural intervention helps reduce health inequities by making community
    resources more accessible regardless of social capital.
