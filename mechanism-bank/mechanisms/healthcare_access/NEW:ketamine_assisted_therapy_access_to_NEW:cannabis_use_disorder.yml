description: Ketamine reduced weekly cannabis use and increased abstinence confidence in one study of
  Cannabis Use Disorder. Evidence is very limited with only a single study examining this indication.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 551
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cannabis use disorder treatment options are limited, and access to novel interventions
    like ketamine is constrained by regulatory, financial, and healthcare system barriers. As cannabis
    legalization expands, structural supports for treatment access become increasingly important.
