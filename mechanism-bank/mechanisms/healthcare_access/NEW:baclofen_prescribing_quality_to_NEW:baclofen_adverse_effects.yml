mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Careful monitoring of baclofen prescribing involves regular patient assessment and dose adjustment'
- 'Step 2: Adherence to prescription rules prevents inappropriate dosing and drug interactions'
- 'Step 3: Physician availability allows for timely intervention when adverse effects emerge'
- 'Step 4: Proper monitoring prevents escalation of adverse effects to severe outcomes'

description: Analysis of circumstances in which severe adverse effects occur suggests that careful monitoring
  of baclofen prescribing might prevent a large majority of severe adverse effects. The paper indicates
  that many severe adverse effects could be related to physicians not following appropriate prescription
  rules and treatment monitoring protocols.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies healthcare system quality and workforce capacity as structural
    determinants of treatment safety. Inadequate physician training, high caseloads limiting monitoring
    capacity, or healthcare access barriers that prevent regular follow-up represent structural factors
    that could increase adverse effect risk. This frames treatment safety as a system-level issue rather
    than individual patient or physician failure.
