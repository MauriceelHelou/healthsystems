mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care facilities (including FQHCs) serve as entry points for healthcare access in underserved
  communities'
- 'Step 2: Integration of drug misuse screening into routine primary care increases detection of substance
  use problems'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention delivery provides early treatment before substance use escalates to disorder'
- 'Step 4: Accessible primary care reduces geographic and financial barriers to receiving substance use
  services'
- 'Step 5: Population-level substance use disorder rates decrease with greater screening and intervention
  coverage'

description: Primary care facility density, particularly in underserved areas, creates structural capacity
  for drug misuse screening and brief intervention at the population level. The protocol notes that many
  primary care facilities have integrated drug misuse screening and brief intervention into usual care
  delivery, suggesting a systems-level approach to substance use prevention.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Primary care access and integration of substance use services varies significantly
    by geographic region and healthcare system capacity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare infrastructure and primary care access
    represent structural determinants of substance use outcomes. Areas with limited primary care capacity
    have reduced opportunity for early identification and intervention. The protocol's focus on primary
    care settings acknowledges that substance use services must be embedded in accessible healthcare infrastructure
    rather than relying solely on specialty treatment systems with higher access barriers.
