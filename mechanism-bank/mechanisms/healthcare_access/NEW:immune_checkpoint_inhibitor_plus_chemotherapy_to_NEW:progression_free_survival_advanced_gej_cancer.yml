mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ICI therapy reactivates exhausted T-cells in the tumor microenvironment'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced immune surveillance prevents tumor cell proliferation and spread'
- 'Step 3: Chemotherapy directly kills rapidly dividing cancer cells'
- 'Step 4: Synergistic effect of immunotherapy and chemotherapy delays disease progression'
- 'Step 5: Extended time before tumor growth or metastasis (progression-free survival)'

description: Combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy as first-line treatment significantly
  improves progression-free survival in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer
  compared to chemotherapy alone, with a 21% reduction in hazard of progression or death.

  equity_implications: Progression-free survival improvements require sustained access to treatment and
    monitoring. Structural barriers including insurance coverage gaps, treatment costs, and access to
    specialized oncology care may create inequities in who benefits from these therapeutic advances.
