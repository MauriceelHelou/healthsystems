category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher primary care physician density increases geographic accessibility
  and availability of ambulatory care services for the population'
- 'Step 2: Improved access enables earlier detection, treatment, and management of
  ambulatory care sensitive conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, asthma, COPD)'
- 'Step 3: Effective outpatient management prevents disease progression and acute
  exacerbations that would otherwise require hospitalization'
- 'Step 4: Reduced rates of avoidable hospitalizations as conditions are appropriately
  managed in the ambulatory setting'

description: Areas with greater primary care physician density demonstrate significantly
  lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations. This relationship reflects the capacity
  of primary care to provide appropriate ambulatory management of conditions that,
  if left untreated or poorly managed, would result in preventable hospital admissions.
  The study found this association while controlling for hospital bed density, specialist
  density, and type of hospital reimbursement.

moderators:
- name: rurality
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Rates of avoidable hospitalizations increased where the proportion
    of residences in rural communities increased, suggesting rurality may attenuate
    the protective effect of primary care
- name: specialist_physician_density
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher specialist density was associated with increased avoidable hospitalizations,
    potentially due to fragmented care or substitution effects
- name: disease_type
  direction: varies
  strength: moderate
  description: Inconsistent patterns were found for disease-specific analyses, suggesting
    the protective effect varies by condition type
