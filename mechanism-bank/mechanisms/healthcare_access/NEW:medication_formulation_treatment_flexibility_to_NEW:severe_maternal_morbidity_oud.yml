mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Treatment guidelines allow flexibility between buprenorphine formulations in pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Pregnant individuals can continue pre-pregnancy medications without forced transitions'
- 'Step 3: Treatment continuity improves adherence and reduces treatment disruption'
- 'Step 4: Stable OUD treatment reduces complications associated with withdrawal or relapse'
- 'Step 5: Comparable maternal morbidity rates support safe flexible prescribing practices'

description: Maternal morbidity rates were comparable between buprenorphine-naloxone (2.6%) and buprenorphine
  alone (2.9%) groups, with no statistically significant difference (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.19).

  equity_implications: This finding supports policy-level changes to treatment guidelines. Restrictive
    policies requiring medication switching during pregnancy create structural barriers that may lead
    to treatment discontinuation and worse outcomes. Evidence supporting treatment flexibility empowers
    collaborative decision-making between providers and pregnant individuals.
