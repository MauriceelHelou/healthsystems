  description: Average of 5+ years incarcerated suggests trauma exposure from incarceration itself; treatment
    may address both pre-existing and incarceration-related trauma
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how criminal justice involvement itself can be traumatizing,
    and how structural alternatives to incarceration can reduce trauma burden. The extensive prior incarceration
    (average 5+ years) among participants suggests that the criminal justice system may contribute to
    trauma, which is then addressed through trauma-informed alternatives. This represents a structural
    approach to healing institutional harm.
