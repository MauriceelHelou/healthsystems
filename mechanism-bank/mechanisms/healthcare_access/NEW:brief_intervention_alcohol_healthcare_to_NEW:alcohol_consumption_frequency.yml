  equity_implications: The finding that individuals with less than high school education show larger effects
    suggests brief interventions may help address health inequities. Lower educational attainment is a
    marker of structural disadvantage often associated with reduced access to specialized treatment services.
    Healthcare-based brief interventions may serve as an equity-promoting intervention by reaching populations
    less likely to access specialized alcohol treatment programs.
