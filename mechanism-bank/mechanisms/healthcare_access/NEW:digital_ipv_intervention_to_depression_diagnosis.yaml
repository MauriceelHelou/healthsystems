mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions (smartphone apps, text messaging, web-based platforms,
  online support groups, telehealth services) provide accessible, private, and convenient
  mental health support to IPV survivors who may face barriers to in-person care'
- 'Step 2: These platforms deliver evidence-based therapeutic content, safety planning
  resources, and psychoeducation that address trauma-related symptoms and cognitive
  distortions associated with IPV victimization'
- 'Step 3: Increased engagement with digital mental health resources reduces social
  isolation, provides coping strategies, and facilitates connections to professional
  support'
- 'Step 4: Sustained intervention engagement leads to clinically meaningful reductions
  in depression symptoms among IPV survivors'

description: Digital and technology-based interventions for intimate partner violence,
  including mobile health (mHealth) and electronic health (eHealth) platforms, are
  designed to reduce depression among IPV survivors. Depression rates are 3-5 times
  higher among IPV victims compared to non-victims, making it a primary target of
  digital interventions. These interventions overcome barriers to traditional care
  by providing private, accessible support through smartphone apps, text messaging,
  online support groups, and telehealth services.
