mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medication First removes prerequisite requirements for psychosocial services before medication
  access'
- 'Step 2: Lower barriers to entry increase immediate engagement with pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 3: Maintenance pharmacotherapy reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings that often precipitate
  dropout'
- 'Step 4: Policy of not discontinuing medication for reasons other than harm maintains treatment continuity'
- 'Step 5: Sustained treatment engagement improves retention rates'

description: Early implementation results show promising treatment retention outcomes when the Medication
  First approach is used. By removing barriers to medication access and protecting against arbitrary treatment
  discontinuation, the approach improves sustained engagement with OUD treatment.

  variation_notes: Early results in Missouri's publicly-funded system show promising treatment retention;
    variation expected across states with different treatment certification standards

    retention benefits
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Traditional treatment models often blame patients for treatment dropout when structural
    barriers (prerequisite requirements, punitive discontinuation policies) are the actual cause. The
    Medication First approach shifts responsibility to the treatment system to provide immediate, sustained
    access. This parallels the Housing First model's recognition that housing instability, not individual
    deficits, drives homelessness.
