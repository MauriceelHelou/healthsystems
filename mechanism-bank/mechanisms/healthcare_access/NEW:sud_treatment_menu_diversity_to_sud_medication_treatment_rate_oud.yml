mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased menu of approved pharmacological treatments expands clinician prescribing options'
- 'Step 2: Diverse treatment mechanisms (GABA modulation, glutamate antagonism, opioid antagonism, etc.)
  allow matching treatment to patient phenotype'
- 'Step 3: Personalized treatment approaches improve treatment retention and efficacy'
- 'Step 4: Higher medication treatment rates reduce alcohol consumption and related harms'

description: The paper emphasizes that expanding the menu of approved AUD pharmacotherapies advances precision
  medicine for this heterogeneous population. Multiple mechanisms of action (disulfiram-aversion, naltrexone-opioid
  antagonism, acamprosate-glutamate modulation, etc.) allow for personalized treatment matching.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Nalmefene is approved in Europe but not widely in other regions, demonstrating regulatory
    variation in treatment availability
moderators:
- name: Patient heterogeneity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The heterogeneous nature of AUD means diverse treatment options are essential for effective
    population-level treatment
- name: Precision medicine advancement
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Advancement of precision medicine and personalized treatment approaches enhances the utility
    of diverse pharmacotherapies
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This represents a structural healthcare system intervention - expanding approved
    treatment options is a policy and regulatory matter rather than individual behavior change. The emphasis
    on heterogeneity acknowledges that one-size-fits-all approaches fail diverse patient populations.
