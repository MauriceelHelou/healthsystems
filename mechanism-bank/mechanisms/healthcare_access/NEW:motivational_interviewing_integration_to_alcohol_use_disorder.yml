  equity_implications: Motivational interviewing addresses the structural issue of how healthcare encounters
    are designed. Traditional medical models often employ directive, judgment-laden approaches that alienate
    patients with AUD. Implementing MI system-wide represents institutional change toward more equitable,
    patient-centered care.
