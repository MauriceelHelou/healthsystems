mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients on OAT frequently have unrecognized co-occurring alcohol misuse'
- 'Step 2: Systematic screening protocols identify alcohol misuse that would otherwise go unaddressed'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention provides structured motivational counseling targeting alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Patient engagement leads to reduced alcohol consumption per day at 3-month follow-up'
- 'Step 5: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases interactions with opioid treatment and improves clinical
  outcomes'

  opioid and alcohol use.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol misuse in OAT populations represents a structural gap in integrated care
    delivery. The limited screening and intervention delivery in OAT settings reflects healthcare system
    fragmentation where substance use disorders are treated in silos rather than comprehensively. Populations
    receiving OAT often face socioeconomic marginalization, and gaps in integrated care exacerbate health
    inequities.
