direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency department serves as point of contact for populations with limited healthcare access'
- 'Step 2: Screening identifies individuals with hazardous drinking patterns or early-stage alcohol problems'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention provides structured feedback and motivation for behavior change'
- 'Step 4: Referral to treatment connects individuals to specialized alcohol treatment services'
- 'Step 5: Early intervention prevents progression to more severe alcohol use disorder'

description: Alcohol brief interventions and SBIRT delivered in emergency care settings reduce alcohol-related
  outcomes by providing a healthcare access point for under-served populations. Review evidence supports
  effectiveness though with heterogeneity across study designs and populations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural approach to addressing alcohol use by leveraging
    healthcare system touchpoints rather than relying on individual help-seeking. Implementation challenges
    highlight need for systemic changes including increased training, integration into service delivery,
    and supportive policy frameworks. The focus on under-served populations explicitly addresses health
    equity.
