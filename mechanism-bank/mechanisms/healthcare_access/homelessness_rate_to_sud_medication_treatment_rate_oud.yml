description: Homeless women veterans have 35% higher odds of receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD compared
  to housed counterparts, suggesting that targeted outreach programs for homeless veterans create more
  opportunities to access and utilize medication treatment for alcohol use disorder.

  equity_implications: This counterintuitive finding demonstrates that structural interventions targeting
    vulnerable populations (homeless outreach programs) can improve healthcare access. Rather than homelessness
    itself being protective, the dedicated services and increased healthcare system contact associated
    with housing instability in the VHA system facilitate treatment. This highlights the importance of
    low-barrier, outreach-based service models for marginalized populations.
