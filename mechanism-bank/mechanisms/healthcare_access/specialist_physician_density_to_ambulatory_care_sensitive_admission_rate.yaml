mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of medical specialists in a region increases the supply
  of specialty care services relative to primary care'
- 'Step 2: Specialist-dominated care patterns may lead to fragmented care coordination
  and reduced emphasis on preventive and chronic disease management typically provided
  by primary care'
- 'Step 3: Patients may preferentially seek or be referred to specialists rather than
  establishing continuous primary care relationships'
- 'Step 4: Reduced primary care continuity results in less effective management of
  ambulatory care sensitive conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, COPD)'
- 'Step 5: Inadequate primary care management of these conditions leads to exacerbations
  and complications requiring hospitalization'

description: Higher medical specialist density is associated with increased rates
  of avoidable hospitalizations. This counterintuitive finding suggests that specialist-heavy
  healthcare systems may underemphasize primary care's role in managing ambulatory
  care sensitive conditions. The study found that while areas with more primary care
  physicians had lower avoidable hospitalization rates, areas with more specialists
  showed increased rates, indicating that the balance between primary and specialty
  care is crucial for preventing unnecessary hospitalizations.
