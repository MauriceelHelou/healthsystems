direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients develop concerns about potential side effects before or during MAUD treatment'
- 'Step 2: Apprehensiveness may stem from inadequate pre-treatment counseling or prior negative experiences'
- 'Step 3: Some patients experience actual side effects that are distressing or intolerable'
- 'Step 4: Fear or experience of side effects leads to treatment avoidance, non-adherence, or discontinuation'
- 'Step 5: Side effect concerns contribute to low overall MAUD initiation and retention rates'

description: Patient apprehensiveness about or direct experience with medication side effects represents
  a key barrier to MAUD utilization. Both anticipated and experienced adverse effects lead patients to
  avoid, discontinue, or poorly adhere to medications for alcohol use disorder.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Side effect concerns reflect both biological realities and healthcare system shortcomings
    in patient education and shared decision-making. Structural factors include limited appointment time
    for counseling, lack of follow-up support for side effect management, and absence of patient-centered
    treatment planning. Healthcare systems should provide adequate resources for side effect education
    and management to improve retention.
