direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals preparing for or recently released from prison receive reentry
  services including enhanced primary care contact, support from community health
  workers, and care coordination programs'
- 'Step 2: These services facilitate continuity of chronic disease management by connecting
  individuals to healthcare providers, ensuring medication access, and providing health
  education during the vulnerable transition period'
- 'Step 3: Sustained engagement with healthcare services and disease monitoring leads
  to improved clinical outcomes for chronic non-communicable diseases including better
  disease control, reduced complications, and improved quality of life'

description: Systematic review of 65 studies (n=18,311) found that reentry-focused
  healthcare interventions including enhanced primary care contact, community health
  worker support, and integrated care systems were associated with improvements in
  various measures of clinical and cost effectiveness for chronic non-communicable
  disease management among people recently released from prison. However, high clinical
  heterogeneity prevented direct comparison between care models.
