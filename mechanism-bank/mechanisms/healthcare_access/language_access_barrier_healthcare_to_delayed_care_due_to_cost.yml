direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Language barriers create anticipatory concern about communication difficulties in healthcare
  settings'
- 'Step 2: Patients feel unsafe or uncomfortable seeking care without adequate interpretation'
- 'Step 3: Patients delay or avoid initial contact with healthcare system'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare access is reduced and care seeking is postponed'

  or avoided contact with the healthcare system and reduced quality of care for immigrant populations.

  variation_notes: Delayed contact with healthcare system documented across European settings with varying
    interpreter policies

  description: Patient awareness of their right to interpreter services can reduce avoidance of healthcare
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Healthcare avoidance by immigrant patients is a rational response to structurally
    inadequate language services, not a cultural preference or individual failing. The responsibility
    lies with healthcare systems to create welcoming, accessible environments through adequate interpreter
    infrastructure.
