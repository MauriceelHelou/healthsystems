description: Very low certainty evidence from a single study (60 participants) suggests phenytoin 300mg/day
  may reduce mean frequency of aggressive acts per week compared to placebo in male prisoners with aggression
  (phenytoin mean=0.33 vs placebo mean=0.51). Evidence quality is insufficient to draw conclusions about
  pharmacological treatment for AsPD.

    generalizability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This review highlights critical structural gaps in mental health research and treatment
    for antisocial personality disorder. The lack of evidence reflects systemic underinvestment in mental
    health research for personality disorders, particularly in carceral settings where AsPD is overrepresented.
    The focus on pharmacological interventions without addressing root causes (adverse childhood experiences,
    socioeconomic factors, lack of community mental health infrastructure) represents a medicalized approach
    that may miss structural determinants. Equity implications include the predominance of male participants
    (90%) and the intersection with criminal justice involvement and substance use disorders.
