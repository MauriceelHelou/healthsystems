- 'Step 1: Telehealth platforms enable remote consultation with mental health providers'
- 'Step 2: Patients can receive assessment and treatment without physical travel to specialty centers'
- 'Step 3: Reduced need for patient transfers to distant mental health facilities'
- 'Step 4: Lower burden on emergency transport systems and reduced patient/family disruption'

description: Telehealth and digital mental health platforms reduce the need for patient transfers by enabling
  remote consultations, particularly valuable in healthcare systems where mental health specialty services
  are geographically concentrated.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Impact likely greater in regions with dispersed populations and concentrated specialty
    mental health services like UAE
moderators:

  description: More severe mental health presentations may still require in-person evaluation and transfer
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Patient transfers represent a structural burden disproportionately affecting rural
    and underserved communities who must travel further for specialty mental health care. Telehealth reduces
    this structural inequity but requires addressing digital access barriers to ensure equitable benefit.
