mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) blocks inhibitory signals on T-cells (e.g.,
  PD-1/PD-L1 pathway)'
- 'Step 2: T-cell activation and proliferation enhances anti-tumor immune response'
- 'Step 3: Concurrent chemotherapy induces tumor cell death and antigen release, further stimulating immune
  recognition'
- 'Step 4: Combined immunogenic and cytotoxic effects lead to greater tumor control'
- 'Step 5: Improved tumor control translates to extended overall survival'

description: Combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy as first-line treatment significantly
  improves overall survival in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer compared
  to chemotherapy alone, with a 14% reduction in hazard of death.

  equity_implications: Access to novel immunotherapy treatments is a structural determinant of cancer
    outcomes. Disparities in access to ICI therapy may exist based on healthcare coverage, geographic
    proximity to cancer centers, and socioeconomic status. Ensuring equitable access to these treatments
    is critical for reducing cancer outcome disparities.
