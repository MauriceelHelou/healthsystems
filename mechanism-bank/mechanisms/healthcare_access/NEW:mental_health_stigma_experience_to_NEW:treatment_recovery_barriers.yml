description: Stigma and discrimination have detrimental effects on individual recovery and treatment access.
  The review establishes that negative stigmatic attitudes create structural barriers to healthcare engagement
  and recovery support for offenders with mental illness.

  description: More stigmatized diagnoses (psychopathy, schizophrenia) likely face greater treatment barriers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Treatment barriers are structurally produced through healthcare system biases and
    discriminatory practices rather than individual treatment non-compliance. Solutions require training
    healthcare workers in anti-stigma approaches, reforming intake procedures, and creating protected
    pathways to care for justice-involved individuals with mental illness.
