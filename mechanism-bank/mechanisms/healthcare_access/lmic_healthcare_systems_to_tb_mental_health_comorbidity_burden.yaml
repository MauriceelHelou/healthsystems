- 'Step 1: Low-to-middle income country healthcare systems lack integrated TB and
  mental health services'
- 'Step 2: Person-centered care interventions for TB comorbidities are almost entirely
  absent'
- 'Step 3: Psychosocial dimensions of TB are not addressed in routine care platforms'
- 'Step 4: Unaddressed mental health comorbidities worsen TB outcomes and vice versa,
  creating bidirectional negative cycle'
