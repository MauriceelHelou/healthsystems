mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Electronic CDSS is integrated into ED workflow and linked to electronic
  health record, automatically populating patient-specific clinical variables upon
  activation'
- 'Step 2: CDSS calculates PE Severity Index score using validated risk-stratification
  criteria, identifying patients with low-risk PE who may be eligible for outpatient
  management'
- 'Step 3: System provides risk-specific, site-of-care recommendations at the time
  of disposition decision making, reducing physician uncertainty about safe discharge'
- 'Step 4: Multicomponent intervention including physician education, audit and feedback,
  and early incentives reinforces CDSS adoption and appropriate use'
- 'Step 5: Physicians are more likely to discharge low-risk PE patients to home management
  rather than defaulting to hospitalization, increasing outpatient management rates'

description: Implementation of an electronic clinical decision support system integrated
  into the ED workflow facilitates identification of patients with pulmonary embolism
  who are eligible for safe outpatient management. The CDSS uses the validated PE
  Severity Index combined with outpatient exclusion criteria to provide risk-specific
  site-of-care recommendations at the point of disposition decision making. When combined
  with physician education, audit and feedback, and existing infrastructure for timely
  follow-up, the CDSS helps overcome perceived barriers to outpatient PE management
  and increases the rate of home discharge for eligible patients.
