- 'Step 1: Healthcare providers deliver brief interventions during prenatal care'

- 'Step 3: Pregnant women reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prenatal alcohol exposure decreases risk of FASD and other adverse neonatal outcomes'

description: Brief alcohol interventions reduce prenatal alcohol exposure by increasing abstinence rates
  during pregnancy, thereby decreasing risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and other adverse
  neonatal outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: FASD is entirely preventable through elimination of prenatal alcohol exposure.
    This mechanism highlights the importance of universal screening and intervention programs integrated
    into prenatal care systems. The structural approach focuses on healthcare system capacity rather than
    blaming individual pregnant women.
