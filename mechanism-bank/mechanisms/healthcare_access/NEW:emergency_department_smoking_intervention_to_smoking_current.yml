description: Smoking cessation interventions delivered in emergency care settings show evidence of reducing
  smoking rates, particularly in short-term follow-up and specific population groups. However, evidence
  base is more limited compared to alcohol interventions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Emergency departments serve as critical access points for populations with limited
    primary care access, including those with lower socioeconomic status who have higher smoking prevalence.
    Embedding cessation interventions in acute care represents a structural approach to health promotion
    that addresses healthcare access disparities.
