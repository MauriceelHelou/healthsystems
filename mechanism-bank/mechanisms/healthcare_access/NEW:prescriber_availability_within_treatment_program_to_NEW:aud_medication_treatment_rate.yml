direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Treatment programs with prescribers on staff have immediate access to providers who can prescribe
  AUD medications'
- 'Step 2: On-site prescribers can integrate medication discussions into routine treatment planning'
- 'Step 3: Reduced administrative barriers and delays in obtaining prescriptions'
- 'Step 4: Increased rates of AUD pharmacotherapy initiation and continuation'

description: Having prescribers integrated into residential treatment program staff facilitates access
  to AUD pharmacotherapy by reducing structural barriers to medication prescription
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Staffing models vary across VA residential programs, contributing to geographic variation
    in pharmacotherapy access

  description: Having prescribers on staff only facilitates pharmacotherapy if prescribers are willing
    to prescribe AUD medications
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights workforce structure and staffing models as structural
    determinants of treatment access. Veterans' access to evidence-based care depends on institutional
    staffing decisions rather than individual treatment-seeking behavior.
