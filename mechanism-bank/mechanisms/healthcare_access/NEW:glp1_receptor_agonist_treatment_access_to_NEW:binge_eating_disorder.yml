description: GLP-1 receptor agonists show promise for treating binge-type eating disorders through central
  nervous system mechanisms that regulate pathological consummatory behaviors, extending beyond simple
  appetite suppression to address compulsive eating patterns.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Binge eating disorder treatment has historically been limited and often not covered
    by insurance. The potential expansion of GLP-1 agonist indications to eating disorders raises structural
    questions about treatment access, as these medications remain expensive and may be gatekept by insurers
    or limited by supply shortages. The biological framing supports viewing eating disorders as neurobiologically-mediated
    conditions rather than failures of self-control.
