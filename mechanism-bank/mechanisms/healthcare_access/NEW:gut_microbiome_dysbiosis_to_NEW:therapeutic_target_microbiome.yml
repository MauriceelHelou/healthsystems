description: The consistent patterns of intestinal microbiome alterations in AUD make the microbiome a
  promising target for developing treatments to prevent or treat AUD complications
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to emerging microbiome-based therapies may be unequally distributed, potentially
    benefiting populations with better healthcare access while leaving underserved communities without
    these interventions. Policy attention to equitable access will be important as treatments develop.
