mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals receive psychotherapy targeting primary mental health conditions
  such as depression, anxiety, or personality disorders rather than suicidal ideation
  directly'
- 'Step 2: Treatment of underlying mental health conditions reduces symptom severity,
  improves emotional regulation, and enhances coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Improvement in primary mental health conditions leads to downstream reductions
  in suicidal ideation as a secondary outcome, even without explicit suicide-focused
  intervention'
- 'Step 4: This indirect pathway provides an alternative treatment route for individuals
  who may not seek or accept direct suicide prevention services'

description: Indirect psychotherapy targeting mental health conditions other than
  suicidal ideation (such as depression or personality disorders) demonstrates a significant
  negative association with suicidal ideation outcomes. Meta-analytic evidence from
  147 randomized clinical trials shows that indirect psychotherapy reduces suicidal
  ideation with a moderate effect size (Hedges g = -0.30), comparable to direct suicide-focused
  interventions. This suggests that treating underlying mental health conditions can
  effectively reduce suicidal ideation as a secondary benefit.
