mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adequate prenatal care provides multiple touchpoints for brief alcohol interventions'
- 'Step 2: Regular prenatal visits allow for ongoing screening and support'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare providers can deliver BIs and monitor progress over pregnancy'
- 'Step 4: Sustained intervention increases likelihood of achieving and maintaining abstinence'

description: Access to adequate prenatal care is a structural prerequisite for delivery of brief alcohol
  interventions, linking healthcare access to reduced prenatal alcohol exposure.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Prenatal care access and quality varies significantly between high-income and low/middle-income
    countries
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights that individual behavior change (alcohol abstinence)
    depends on structural factors (healthcare system capacity, prenatal care access). Populations with
    limited healthcare access may have reduced opportunity to benefit from evidence-based interventions,
    creating health inequities.
