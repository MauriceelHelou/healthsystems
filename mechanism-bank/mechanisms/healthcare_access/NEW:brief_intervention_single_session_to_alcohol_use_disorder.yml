- 'Step 1: Brief interventions delivered in single face-to-face sessions represent the most commonly studied
  approach in the literature'
- 'Step 2: Single session provides opportunity for screening, feedback, and initial motivation enhancement'
- 'Step 3: Limited intensity may provide less sustained behavior change support compared to multiple sessions'
- 'Step 4: Effect on harmful alcohol use is present but smaller than more intensive approaches'

description: Brief interventions delivered in single face-to-face sessions were the most commonly studied
  approach (6 of 19 studies) in the systematic review. While these represent pragmatic, accessible interventions,
  the network meta-analysis suggested they are less effective than more intensive combined multi-session
  approaches for reducing harmful alcohol consumption.

  description: Single session delivery associated with smaller effects compared to multiple session approaches
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Brief single-session interventions are often implemented due to healthcare system
    constraints including limited time, funding, and workforce capacity rather than optimal patient outcomes.
    The finding that more intensive interventions are more effective highlights how healthcare system
    resource allocation decisions affect treatment effectiveness. Populations served by under-resourced
    healthcare systems may receive only brief interventions, resulting in suboptimal outcomes and perpetuating
    health disparities in alcohol-related harms.
