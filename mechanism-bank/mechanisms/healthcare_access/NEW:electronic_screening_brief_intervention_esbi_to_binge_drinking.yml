description: e-SBI shows uncertain effects on binge drinking among trauma patients. While the intervention
  targets this risk behavior, heterogeneity in how binge drinking was measured across the 4 RCTs limits
  confidence in the effect.

  description: Lack of standardized outcome measurements contributed to uncertainties in binge drinking
    outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The uncertainty in binge drinking outcomes highlights the need for standardized
    approaches in health systems. Structural factors including inconsistent measurement practices and
    varying definitions of binge drinking across healthcare systems create barriers to understanding intervention
    effectiveness, particularly for populations with different drinking norms.
