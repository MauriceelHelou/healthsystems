mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare staff lack training in addiction and hold stigmatizing attitudes toward substance
  users'
- 'Step 2: Staff attitudes create unwelcoming care environments for people who use drugs/alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Patients may avoid or delay seeking palliative care due to anticipated discrimination'
- 'Step 4: Clinical decisions may be influenced by bias rather than patient needs'
- 'Step 5: Access to and quality of end-of-life care is compromised'

description: Healthcare provider skills gaps and attitudes toward people who use substances create barriers
  to palliative care access. The review identifies the need for staff sensitization and training as key
  elements of an effective care model, indicating that provider-level factors rooted in institutional
  training practices affect patient access to care.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies provider stigma as a systemic rather than individual
    issue, rooted in inadequate training and institutional culture. The solution lies in structural interventions
    (training programs, inclusive policies) rather than expecting individual patients to overcome discrimination.
    This frames healthcare institutions as responsible for creating non-discriminatory environments.
