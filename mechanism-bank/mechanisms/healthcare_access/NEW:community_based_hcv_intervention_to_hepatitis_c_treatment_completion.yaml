mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community-based interventions bring HCV screening, assessment, and treatment
  services directly to people who are homeless, eliminating transportation and accessibility
  barriers to traditional healthcare settings'
- 'Step 2: Integrated services including mental health support and peer mentorship
  address psychosocial barriers that typically impede treatment engagement in marginalized
  populations'
- 'Step 3: Sustained engagement through community-based care enables completion of
  direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment regimens, resulting in high sustained virological
  response (SVR) rates'
- 'Step 4: Community setting facilitates continuity of care and reduces loss to follow-up
  that commonly occurs when homeless populations must navigate traditional healthcare
  systems'

description: Community-based HCV assessment and treatment interventions significantly
  improve hepatitis C treatment completion rates among people who are homeless. This
  systematic review of 39 studies (n=13,918) found that intention-to-treat SVR rates
  with direct-acting antivirals in community settings ranged from 82-92%, reaching
  92% in studies exclusively including homeless populations. Two RCTs demonstrated
  that community-based interventions incorporating mental health support and peer
  mentorship significantly increased linkage to care (p=0.04), treatment initiation
  (p=0.005), and SVR achievement (p=0.018) compared to standard care approaches.

    studies) represents a barrier; notably no studies provided alcohol use interventions
