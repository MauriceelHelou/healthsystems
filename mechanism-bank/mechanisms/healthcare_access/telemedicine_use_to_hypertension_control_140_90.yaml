mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telemedicine enables remote communication and interaction between healthcare
  providers and patients with hypertension'
- 'Step 2: Increased accessibility facilitates more frequent monitoring of blood pressure
  and medication adherence'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced patient engagement and self-efficacy support sustained disease
  management behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Continuous remote support and individualized care lead to improved blood
  pressure control outcomes'

description: Telemedicine significantly improves blood pressure control in patients
  with hypertension. Meta-analysis of clinical trials found telemedicine reduced systolic
  blood pressure by 10.4 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 4.8 mmHg. The mechanism
  operates through enhanced patient-provider communication, improved blood pressure
  monitoring, increased medication adherence, and better patient engagement and self-efficacy.
