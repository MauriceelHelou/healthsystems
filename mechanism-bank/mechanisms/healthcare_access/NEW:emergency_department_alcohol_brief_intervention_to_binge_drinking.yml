- 'Step 1: Urgent and emergency care (UEC) settings screen patients for hazardous alcohol use using validated
  tools'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions (SBIRT) are delivered by clinical staff to at-risk individuals during healthcare
  encounter'
- 'Step 3: Motivational interviewing and health education increase patient awareness of alcohol-related
  harms'
- 'Step 4: Referral to treatment pathways are established for those requiring additional support'
- 'Step 5: Short-term reductions in alcohol consumption and binge drinking behaviors result'

description: Brief alcohol interventions delivered in emergency department settings as part of SBIRT (Screening,
  Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) approaches demonstrate significant decreases in alcohol
  consumption and alcohol-related outcomes, particularly in short-term follow-up and specific population
  groups.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: UEC settings provide structural opportunity to reach under-served, at-risk populations
    who may not access traditional healthcare. This mechanism addresses healthcare access inequities by
    embedding preventive interventions within acute care encounters. However, implementation barriers
    faced by clinicians and need for training, integration into service delivery, and supportive policy
    highlight systemic healthcare delivery challenges.
