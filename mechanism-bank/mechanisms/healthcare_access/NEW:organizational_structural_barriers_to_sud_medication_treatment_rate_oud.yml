- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems have embedded structural barriers including incompatible workflows and inadequate
  resources'
- 'Step 2: Compatibility issues create friction between AUD pharmacotherapy protocols and existing primary
  care workflows'
- 'Step 3: Design quality and packaging of interventions may not fit local context and clinical realities'
- 'Step 4: Available resources (time, staffing, infrastructure) remain insufficient for implementation'
- 'Step 5: Persistent structural barriers limit sustained uptake of AUD pharmacotherapy despite educational
  interventions'

description: Despite educational interventions, structural and organizational barriers including Compatibility,
  Design Quality & Packaging, and Available Resources remained barriers at the end of the implementation
  period. These findings indicate that traditional educational approaches are insufficient to address
  deeply embedded organizational and resource constraints that limit AUD pharmacotherapy access in primary
  care.

  equity_implications: This mechanism clearly demonstrates how healthcare system structures—not individual
    patient or provider deficits—create barriers to AUD treatment access. The finding that structural
    barriers persisted despite educational success highlights that increasing treatment access requires
    addressing organizational resource allocation, workflow design, and systemic compatibility issues.
    This has significant equity implications as patients in under-resourced settings face compounded barriers
    to care.
