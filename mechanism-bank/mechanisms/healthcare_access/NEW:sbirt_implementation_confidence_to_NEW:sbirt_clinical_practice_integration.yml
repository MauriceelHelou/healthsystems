mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare workers with increased confidence are more likely to initiate alcohol screening
  conversations'
- 'Step 2: Practical guidance on patient assessment enables systematic identification of excessive alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Skills in brief advice delivery facilitate intervention during clinical encounters'
- 'Step 4: Knowledge of referral decision-making supports appropriate treatment connections for patients
  needing specialized care'

description: Increased confidence and skills in SBIRT among healthcare workers facilitates integration
  of alcohol screening and brief intervention into routine clinical practice in urgent and emergency care
  settings. Qualitative interviews confirmed training was perceived as useful for workforce skills development
  and supporting SBIRT implementation.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system capacity building can improve population
    health. The structural approach recognizes that lack of provider training is a system-level barrier,
    not an individual provider failing. The intervention creates structural conditions (trained workforce)
    necessary for alcohol prevention to become routine care. Equity considerations include that emergency
    departments often serve as primary care access point for underserved populations, making SBIRT implementation
    in these settings particularly important for health equity.
