- 'Step 1: Implementation of multifaceted intervention (REACH) increases clinician training and resources
  for alcohol screening'
- 'Step 2: Primary care clinicians increase documentation and recording of patient alcohol status'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol status recording leads to identification of at-risk drinkers'
- 'Step 4: Brief interventions delivered to identified patients reduce harmful alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 5: Reduced harmful consumption decreases progression to alcohol use disorder'

description: Multifaceted intervention (REACH) significantly increased recorded alcohol status in intervention
  sites from 56.7% to 60.4%, while non-intervention practices showed no significant change (55.2% to 56.4%).
  This demonstrates that structured implementation programs can increase alcohol brief intervention delivery
  in primary care serving low-income communities.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural barriers to alcohol harm reduction by targeting
    healthcare system capacity rather than individual patient behavior. The focus on low-income communities
    in Melbourne addresses health equity by improving access to preventive interventions in underserved
    populations. The study recognizes that brief interventions are clinically indicated but underdelivered,
    pointing to systemic healthcare delivery gaps rather than individual patient failures.
