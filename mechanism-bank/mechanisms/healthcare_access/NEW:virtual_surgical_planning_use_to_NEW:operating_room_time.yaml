- 'Step 1: Virtual surgical planning (VSP) enables pre-operative 3D modeling and simulation
  of head and neck reconstruction procedures'
- 'Step 2: Surgeons can pre-plan osteotomies, plate positioning, and fibula placement
  before entering the operating room'
- 'Step 3: Pre-fabricated surgical guides and patient-specific implants reduce intraoperative
  decision-making and trial-and-error fitting'
- 'Step 4: Reduced need for intraoperative adjustments and measurements leads to more
  efficient surgical workflow'
- 'Step 5: Operating room time is decreased compared to traditional freehand surgical
  approaches'

description: Virtual surgical planning in head and neck reconstruction reduces operating
  room time compared to traditional freehand surgery. This systematic review of 18
  studies (n=733 patients) found that 78% of studies reported VSP either generated
  cost savings or was comparable to freehand surgery, with the majority of cost savings
  attributed to reduced OR times and length of stay/hospitalization. Pre-operative
  digital planning, patient-specific guides, and pre-fabricated implants streamline
  intraoperative workflow.

  description: In-house VSP workflows were associated with greater cost savings compared
    to outsourced VSP, suggesting the efficiency gains including OR time reduction
    may be more pronounced with in-house planning
