- 'Step 1: Patients with OUD on methadone maintenance may seek to transition to buprenorphine or extended-release
  naltrexone'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians resist or frustrate patient requests for medication transitions'
- 'Step 3: Patients experience barriers to shared decision-making about their treatment options'
- 'Step 4: Patient frustration leads to disengagement from treatment and reduced medication treatment
  rates'

description: Clinician reluctance to support patient requests for transitioning from methadone to buprenorphine
  or extended-release naltrexone creates barriers to patient-centered OUD care and may reduce treatment
  engagement
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 23
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies provider and healthcare system barriers rather than patient
    non-compliance as the source of treatment challenges. The structural issue is clinician training,
    attitudes, and practice patterns that limit patient autonomy in treatment decisions.
