description: Virtual reality simulation training significantly increased nursing students' knowledge of
  SBIRT characteristics, screening tools, and alcohol consumption guidelines (p < .05), with sustained
  confidence improvements at 3-month follow-up (p < .001). This workforce development intervention addresses
  the structural gap in healthcare provider training for substance use disorder screening and intervention.

  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses a structural barrier in healthcare workforce preparation.
    Many healthcare providers lack adequate training in substance use disorder screening, creating systemic
    gaps in early identification and intervention. By standardizing SBIRT education through simulation,
    this approach can improve healthcare system capacity to address alcohol and substance use disorders
    equitably across settings. The focus on both mental health and primary care settings acknowledges
    the need for integrated care approaches rather than siloed treatment systems.
