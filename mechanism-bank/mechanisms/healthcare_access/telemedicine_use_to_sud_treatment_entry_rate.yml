mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Remote/digital interventions reduce geographic and logistical barriers to accessing treatment'
- 'Step 2: Telephone and computer-based modalities offer flexibility in scheduling and location'
- 'Step 3: Reduced stigma associated with attending treatment facilities may increase willingness to engage'
- 'Step 4: Increased accessibility leads to greater treatment initiation and sustained engagement'
- 'Step 5: More individuals with alcohol/drug use disorders receive evidence-based interventions'

  description: Remote interventions show clearer benefits when supplementing rather than replacing in-person
    care
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses healthcare access disparities rooted in geographic maldistribution
    of SUD treatment facilities, particularly affecting rural communities and areas with treatment facility
    shortages. Digital interventions can partially mitigate structural inequities in treatment availability,
    though digital divide concerns require attention.
