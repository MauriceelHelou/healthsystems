mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Opioid substitution therapy (OST) such as methadone or buprenorphine stabilizes
  opioid-dependent individuals by providing controlled, long-acting opioid agonists'
- 'Step 2: OST reduces illicit opioid use, injection drug use, and associated high-risk
  behaviors that lead to medical emergencies'
- 'Step 3: Stabilized patients experience fewer overdoses, infections, and acute withdrawal
  episodes that would otherwise require emergency care'
- 'Step 4: OST programs often connect patients with primary care and preventive services,
  shifting care from emergency to routine settings'
- 'Step 5: Reduced frequency of acute drug-related crises leads to decreased emergency
  department presentations'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 studies examining ED utilization
  found that opioid substitution therapy was consistently associated with reduced
  emergency department presentation among people who use illicit drugs. People who
  use drugs have ED visit rates approximately 4.8 times higher than the general population
  (151 per 100 person-years), and OST provides a mechanism to reduce this disparity
  by stabilizing patients, reducing acute drug-related emergencies, and connecting
  them with routine healthcare.
