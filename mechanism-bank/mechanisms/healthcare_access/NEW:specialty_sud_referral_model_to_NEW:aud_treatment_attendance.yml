description: The traditional model of referring patients with AUD from primary care to specialty SUD clinics
  creates structural barriers that result in low treatment attendance. The abstract explicitly states
  that 'only a minority of those referred attend treatment services,' indicating a care delivery model
  that fails to meet patients where they are.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a healthcare system design flaw rather than patient non-compliance.
    The referral model places burden on patients to navigate between care settings, creating structural
    barriers that disproportionately affect those with fewer resources, transportation challenges, or
    stigma concerns. Integrating treatment into primary care addresses this structural inequity.
