description: e-SBI shows uncertain effects on reducing alcohol-related consequences among trauma patients.
  The review noted that while problematic alcohol consumption decreased, evidence for reduction in alcohol-related
  consequences specifically remained uncertain.

  description: Variations in trauma patient populations across studies contributed to nuanced findings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Trauma settings represent a critical intervention point where structural healthcare
    systems can address alcohol-related harm. The scalability of e-SBI addresses workforce constraints
    that limit delivery of evidence-based interventions. Tailored approaches, as emphasized in the review,
    are necessary to address diverse populations and social contexts that influence alcohol use patterns
    and consequences.
