direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher incarceration rates result in more individuals experiencing imprisonment
  and subsequent release into the community'
- 'Step 2: Incarceration exposes individuals to trauma, disrupts social bonds, employment,
  and housing stability, and concentrates psychiatric vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: The transition period after release creates acute vulnerability due to
  loss of structured support, stigma, social isolation, and barriers to accessing
  mental health services'
- 'Step 4: These compounded stressors and psychiatric risk factors substantially elevate
  suicide risk among formerly incarcerated individuals compared to the general population'

description: People released from incarceration are greater than seven times more
  likely to die by suicide than the general population (SMR 7.4). The pooled crude
  mortality rate for suicide was 114.5 per 100,000 person-years in non-sex stratified
  samples. This elevated risk reflects the cumulative impact of pre-existing vulnerabilities,
  traumatic experiences during incarceration, and severe social and economic disruptions
  following release. The suicide rate after release exceeds that during incarceration,
  highlighting the critical vulnerability of the reentry period.
