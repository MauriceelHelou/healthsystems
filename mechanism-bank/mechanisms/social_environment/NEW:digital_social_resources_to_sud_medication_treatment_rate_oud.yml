- 'Step 1: Digital inequalities extend beyond technology access to include social resources leveraged
  through digital means'
- 'Step 2: Social networks accessed through digital platforms provide treatment information and referrals'
- 'Step 3: Online peer support communities can encourage treatment seeking and provide ongoing support'
- 'Step 4: Those with limited digital social resources have reduced access to these treatment-promoting
  networks'
- 'Step 5: Diminished social capital through digital exclusion reduces likelihood of treatment engagement'

description: Digital inequalities encompass not just technology access and skills but also social resources
  that can be leveraged through digital means, affecting treatment seeking through reduced access to online
  support networks and treatment information
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that social capital operates through digital infrastructure,
    making technology access a social determinant of health. It highlights how structural exclusion from
    digital resources compounds social isolation faced by those with substance use disorders.
