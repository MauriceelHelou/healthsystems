- 'Step 1: Policy makers and scientists employ refutation-based communication approaches'
- 'Step 2: Refutation texts can be used proactively as warning labels or inoculation'
- 'Step 3: Refutation texts can be used retroactively to debunk misconceptions'
- 'Step 4: Consistent exposure to corrective information improves scientific understanding'
- 'Step 5: Improved science literacy enables better health decision-making'

description: Structured refutation-based science communication reduces low health literacy by providing
  evidence-based corrective information that counters rampant misinformation on social media. This has
  direct implications for alcohol-related health misinformation, where misconceptions about safe drinking
  levels, health benefits, or harm reduction may persist without effective communication strategies.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Health literacy disparities are structurally determined by educational access,
    language barriers, and information environment quality. This research supports investment in evidence-based
    communication infrastructure as a structural intervention. Communities with less access to quality
    education and greater exposure to misinformation (often due to algorithmic targeting and media deserts)
    stand to benefit most from systematic deployment of refutation-based public health messaging.
