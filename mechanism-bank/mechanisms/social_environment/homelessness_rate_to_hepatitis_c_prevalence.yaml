mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates conditions of housing instability, limiting access
  to safe hygiene facilities and private spaces for health practices'
- 'Step 2: People experiencing homelessness have elevated rates of injection drug
  use (21% prevalence in homeless-only populations) as a coping mechanism and due
  to co-occurring substance use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Injection drug use in unstable housing conditions leads to increased needle
  sharing and use of non-sterile injection equipment'
- 'Step 4: High-risk injection practices combined with limited healthcare access result
  in elevated HCV transmission and seroprevalence (20% pooled prevalence in homeless-only
  populations)'
- 'Step 5: Barriers to healthcare access, treatment adherence, and continuity of care
  among homeless populations allow HCV infection to persist and spread within this
  community'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 39 studies demonstrates that
  people who are homeless have substantially elevated HCV seroprevalence (20% pooled
  estimate in homeless-only populations, range 2.5%-58% across all studies). The pathway
  operates primarily through elevated injection drug use rates (21% in homeless populations),
  which facilitates HCV transmission through needle sharing. Additional contributing
  factors include high rates of alcohol use (59%), limited access to screening and
  treatment services, and barriers to healthcare engagement. Despite these challenges,
  when community-based treatment is provided, SVR rates of 92% are achievable.
