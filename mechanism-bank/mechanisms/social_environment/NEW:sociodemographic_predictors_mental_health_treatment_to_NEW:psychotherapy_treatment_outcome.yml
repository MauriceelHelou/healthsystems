mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Age and gender are frequently examined as predictors but show mixed results across studies'
- 'Step 2: Inconsistent findings suggest sociodemographic effects are moderated by disorder type and treatment
  context'
- 'Step 3: Overall, most sociodemographic variables did not consistently predict treatment outcomes'
- 'Step 4: This suggests individual sociodemographic factors may be less important than structural and
  treatment-level factors'

description: Systematic review found that age, gender, and ethnicity were most frequently reported sociodemographic
  predictors of psychotherapy outcomes for young people with mental disorders. However, for age and gender,
  findings were mixed and inconclusive. The overall conclusion was that most sociodemographic variables
  did not support their relevance for predicting treatment outcome.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of consistent sociodemographic predictors for most variables (except ethnic
    minority status and trauma history) suggests that treatment outcomes may be more influenced by structural
    factors in healthcare delivery, treatment quality, and access than by individual patient characteristics.
    This challenges deficit-based approaches that blame poor outcomes on patient demographics.
