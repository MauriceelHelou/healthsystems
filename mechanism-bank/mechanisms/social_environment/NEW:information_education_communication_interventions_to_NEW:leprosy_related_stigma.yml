direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IEC interventions provide accurate information about leprosy transmission, treatment, and prognosis
  to communities'
- 'Step 2: Increased knowledge reduces misconceptions and fear-based beliefs about leprosy contagion'
- 'Step 3: Reduced fear decreases social distancing behaviors and discriminatory attitudes toward affected
  individuals'
- 'Step 4: Lower community stigma enables earlier care-seeking and improved social integration of affected
  persons'

description: Information, education, and communication interventions reduce leprosy-related stigma by
  addressing knowledge gaps and misconceptions in communities, which reduces fear-based discrimination
  and enables earlier care-seeking.

    note interventions need testing in other leprosy endemic areas to assess effectiveness across contextual

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural determinants by targeting community-level knowledge
    deficits that create social barriers for affected individuals. Rather than blaming individuals for
    not seeking care, it recognizes that stigmatization is a community-level phenomenon requiring population-level
    interventions. Equity implications include addressing how marginalized populations with leprosy face
    compounded discrimination.
