- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates unstable living situations incompatible with standard palliative care
  delivery models'
- 'Step 2: Lack of fixed address prevents consistent follow-up and care coordination'
- 'Step 3: Homeless individuals may be excluded from facility-based palliative care due to admission criteria'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring substance use and homelessness compounds stigma and access barriers'
- 'Step 5: End-of-life care needs go unmet due to structural barriers in healthcare delivery'

description: Homelessness is identified as a key factor that compounds the challenges of providing palliative
  care to people who use drugs and/or alcohol. The lack of stable housing creates structural barriers
  to receiving appropriate end-of-life care, requiring flexible, multidisciplinary approaches to address.

  description: Multi-disciplinary, flexible approaches to care can mitigate barriers faced by homeless
    individuals
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism clearly identifies homelessness as a structural determinant of healthcare
    access rather than an individual failing. It highlights how healthcare systems designed for housed
    populations systematically exclude homeless individuals from essential end-of-life care, requiring
    structural adaptation of care delivery models.
