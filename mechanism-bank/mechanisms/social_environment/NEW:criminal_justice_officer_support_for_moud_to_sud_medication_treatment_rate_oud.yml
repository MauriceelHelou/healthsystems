  equity_implications: While attitudinal support from authority figures facilitates treatment access,
    the selective support for antagonist therapy (naltrexone) over agonist therapies (buprenorphine, methadone)
    reveals persistent structural bias in the criminal justice system's approach to addiction treatment.
    True structural competency requires evidence-based support for all MOUD options.
