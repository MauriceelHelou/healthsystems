description: PLWH who had higher levels of social support were less likely to report HIV-related stigma.

  equity_implications: The protective effect of social support highlights a structural intervention point
    - the paper explicitly recommends provision of social support by practitioners as a strategy to reduce
    stigma. This shifts responsibility from individual coping to healthcare system and community-level
    support structures.
