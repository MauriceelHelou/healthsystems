direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High visibility of alcohol outlets, advertising, and alcohol consumption
  in public spaces creates constant environmental cues'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure to alcohol cues in everyday environments normalizes alcohol
  as ordinary part of community life'
- 'Step 3: Normalization reduces perceived risks and increases social acceptability
  of drinking'
- 'Step 4: Social norms supporting drinking facilitate increased consumption across
  population'
