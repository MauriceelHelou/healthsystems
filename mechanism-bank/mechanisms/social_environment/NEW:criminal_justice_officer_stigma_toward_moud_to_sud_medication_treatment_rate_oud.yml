  node_name: OUD Medication Treatment Rate
direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Probation and parole officers hold stigmatizing attitudes toward buprenorphine and methadone
  (agonist medications)'
- 'Step 2: Officers may discourage or create barriers to individuals seeking these specific MOUD options'
- 'Step 3: Justice-involved individuals face reduced access to full range of evidence-based treatment
  options'
- 'Step 4: Lower overall MOUD utilization and suboptimal treatment matching'
- 'Step 5: Reduced recovery and remission outcomes among justice-involved individuals with OUD'

  and methadone, reduce access to the full continuum of MOUD options for justice-involved individuals
  with OUD.

  description: Stigma specifically directed toward buprenorphine and methadone (agonist therapies) rather
    than extended-release naltrexone (antagonist therapy)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how institutional attitudes within the criminal justice
    system create structural barriers to evidence-based healthcare. The differential stigma toward agonist
    vs antagonist therapies reflects broader societal misconceptions about medication-assisted treatment.
    Addressing this requires system-level training and policy change rather than individual-level interventions.
