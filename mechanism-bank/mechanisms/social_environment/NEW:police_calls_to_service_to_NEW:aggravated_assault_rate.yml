mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High volume of police calls reflects ongoing social disorder and crime in the neighborhood'
- 'Step 2: Despite greater police presence, disadvantaged communities experience limited crime abatement'
- 'Step 3: Reactive policing (responding to calls) may not address underlying structural drivers of violence'
- 'Step 4: Persistent violence despite police activity indicates policing alone is insufficient to reduce
  aggravated assaults'

description: Police calls to service are positively associated with aggravated assault rates, with each
  unit increase associated with a 24% increase in assault incidence. Critically, the abstract notes that
  disadvantaged communities experience greater police presence without corresponding crime reduction,
  suggesting policing alone does not address structural drivers of violence.

  description: Abstract explicitly notes disadvantaged urban communities are burdened by greater police

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding challenges assumptions that increased policing reduces violence. The
    positive association likely reflects that police calls are markers of neighborhood disorder rather
    than causes of violence. The abstract explicitly critiques the burden of police presence in disadvantaged
    communities without crime abatement—pointing to the need for structural interventions (addressing
    alcohol outlets, abandoned properties) rather than solely relying on law enforcement.
