mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior sexual assault victimization creates psychological vulnerabilities
  including trauma symptoms, PTSD, depression, and anxiety that may impair threat
  detection and protective behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Previous trauma may lead to maladaptive coping strategies such as increased
  alcohol or substance use, which are independently associated with revictimization
  risk'
- 'Step 3: Prior victimization may result in altered risk perception, self-blame,
  or relationship patterns that increase exposure to potential perpetrators'
- 'Step 4: Perpetrators may strategically target individuals with prior victimization
  histories, perceiving them as more vulnerable or less likely to report'

description: Prior sexual assault victimization is one of the strongest correlates
  of subsequent sexual assault victimization among college students. This meta-analysis
  of 118 studies found that individuals with prior SA victimization history face significantly
  elevated risk of revictimization, likely through multiple pathways including psychological
  vulnerability, altered coping mechanisms, and potential perpetrator targeting behaviors.
