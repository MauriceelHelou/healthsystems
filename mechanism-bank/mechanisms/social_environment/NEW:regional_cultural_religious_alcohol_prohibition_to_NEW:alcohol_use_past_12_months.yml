direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Religious and cultural norms in Eastern Mediterranean region strongly discourage or prohibit
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Legal frameworks in many countries restrict alcohol sales, importation, and consumption'
- 'Step 3: Social stigma and reduced availability decrease population-level alcohol access and use'
- 'Step 4: Regional prevalence remains significantly lower than global averages (6.2% vs 43%)'

description: Cultural and religious norms in the Eastern Mediterranean region, predominantly Islamic,
  create structural barriers to alcohol consumption through legal restrictions, social stigma, and reduced
  availability. This results in a 12-month alcohol use prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI 3.9-9.6%), which is
  approximately one-seventh of the global prevalence of 43%.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately frames alcohol use patterns as shaped by macro-level
    cultural, religious, and legal structures rather than individual choices. The finding that regional
    prevalence is much lower than global averages demonstrates how structural factors powerfully shape
    health behaviors. However, the finding that prevalence may be increasing (from 2.9% in 2016 WHO estimates
    to 6.2% in this review) suggests potential shifts in these structural protections.
