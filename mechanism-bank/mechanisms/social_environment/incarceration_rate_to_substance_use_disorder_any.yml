- 'Step 1: High incarceration rates result in large populations of individuals with substance use histories
  being concentrated in prisons'
- 'Step 2: Limited treatment availability within correctional systems means many do not receive adequate
  care'
- 'Step 3: Incarceration disrupts existing treatment relationships and community support systems'
- 'Step 4: Post-release individuals face barriers to treatment access, housing, and employment that perpetuate
  substance use'
- 'Step 5: Cyclical pattern of substance use, crime, and reincarceration persists'

description: The review highlights that alcohol and other drug use history is common among incarcerated
  men and often linked to their crimes. This suggests a bidirectional relationship where incarceration
  concentrates individuals with substance use disorders while the carceral experience may perpetuate these
  conditions without adequate treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism centers structural factors rather than individual blame. Mass incarceration
    as policy creates conditions that perpetuate substance use disorders by: disrupting community ties,
    creating barriers to employment and housing upon release, and substituting punishment for treatment.
    The review''s focus on men in prison also highlights gendered dimensions of incarceration and substance
    use. Racial and economic disparities in incarceration mean these harms are not equally distributed
    across populations.'
