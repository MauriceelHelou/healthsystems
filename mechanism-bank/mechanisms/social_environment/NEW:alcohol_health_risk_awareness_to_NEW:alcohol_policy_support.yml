- 'Step 1: Greater awareness of alcohol''s health risks increases perception of alcohol as a public health
  issue'
- 'Step 2: Recognition of public health framing increases support for regulatory interventions'
- 'Step 3: Higher public support enables political will for evidence-based policy implementation'
- 'Step 4: Policy implementation creates structural conditions for reduced population-level alcohol harm'

description: Respondents with greater awareness of the health risks of alcohol showed higher levels of
  support for alcohol control measures. This suggests health literacy campaigns may be necessary preconditions
  for building political support for structural alcohol policy interventions.

  description: Counterintuitively, those who experienced harms due to other people's drinking showed lower
    support compared to those who had not experienced such harms
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how population-level health literacy creates enabling
    conditions for structural policy change. It suggests that individual awareness must be understood
    in relation to policy environments, not as individual responsibility for behavior change.
