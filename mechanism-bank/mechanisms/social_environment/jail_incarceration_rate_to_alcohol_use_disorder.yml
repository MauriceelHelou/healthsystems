  using validated screening tools. This represents the highest concentration of AUD at the entry point
  to the criminal justice system.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Police custody represents a critical structural intervention point where high AUD
    prevalence could be addressed through systematic screening and brief intervention. The failure to
    implement effective interventions at this stage represents a missed public health opportunity within
    the criminal justice infrastructure.
