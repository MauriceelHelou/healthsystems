description: 64% of young people in the UK criminal justice system scored positive for alcohol use disorder,
  indicating that youth involvement in the justice system strongly correlates with AUD prevalence.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 64.0
    type: percentage_change
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: UK youth criminal justice system data; USA studies show some promise for brief interventions
    with young people
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The high AUD prevalence among justice-involved youth reflects structural failures
    in early intervention, family support systems, and youth-appropriate alcohol services. The criminal
    justice system becomes a default response to untreated youth alcohol problems, potentially worsening
    trajectories rather than providing treatment.
