- 'Step 1: Organizational networking practices require attendance at alcohol-centered events for career
  advancement'
- 'Step 2: Religious minorities face conflicting pressures between career expectations and religious prohibitions
  on alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Muslim women engage in ''emotional effort'' to persuade themselves to attend events where alcohol
  is served'
- 'Step 4: This ongoing negotiation between professional obligations and religious identity creates chronic
  psychological strain'
- 'Step 5: The paradoxical outcome of continued marginalization despite participation compounds emotional
  burden'

description: The qualitative findings reveal that British Muslim women in professional positions experience
  significant emotional effort when navigating workplace networking events centered on alcohol. The study
  documents how these women must constantly reconcile their religious practices with organizational expectations,
  leading to ongoing psychological strain. The paradox of participating yet still experiencing marginalization
  creates an additional layer of stress.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately identifies the structural source of stress as organizational
    norms rather than individual psychological vulnerability. The emotional labor required to navigate
    contradictory demands reflects systemic failure to accommodate religious diversity in workplace culture.
    This framing aligns with structural competency by locating the intervention point at the organizational/policy
    level rather than expecting individuals to adapt to exclusionary norms.
