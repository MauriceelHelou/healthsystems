mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Conflict and natural disasters create contexts of societal instability,
  displacement, and resource scarcity that disrupt social structures and support systems'
- 'Step 2: These crisis conditions interact with existing patriarchal norms and gender
  inequalities, exacerbating power imbalances within households'
- 'Step 3: Economic stress, trauma, substance use, and breakdown of community protective
  factors increase risk of male-perpetrated violence against intimate partners'
- 'Step 4: Countries experiencing both conflict and disasters alongside patriarchal
  post-colonial contexts show distinctly elevated IPV prevalence compared to non-patriarchal
  egalitarian contexts'

description: Exposure to conflict and natural disasters creates high-risk contexts
  for intimate partner violence, particularly when combined with patriarchal norms
  and post-colonial structural inequalities. Latent class analysis of 190 countries
  identified that patriarchal post-colonial contexts affected by conflict and disasters
  represent a distinct high-risk cluster for IPV. These contexts are characterized
  by younger populations, higher drug use disorders, and elevated IPV prevalence compared
  to non-patriarchal egalitarian contexts.
