mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: History of traumatic events creates complex trauma presentations that standard treatments may
  not adequately address'
- 'Step 2: Trauma alters neurobiological stress response systems and emotional regulation capacity'
- 'Step 3: Complex trauma requires longer and more intensive treatment approaches than typically provided'
- 'Step 4: Standard psychotherapy protocols may be insufficient for trauma-affected youth, leading to
  poorer treatment outcomes'

description: History of traumatic events predicts poorer psychotherapy treatment outcomes for young people
  with mental disorders. This reflects the structural reality that standard treatments are often not trauma-informed
  and may be insufficient for addressing the complex presentations of trauma-affected youth.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'Traumatic events experienced by youth often stem from structural conditions including
    poverty, community violence, family instability driven by economic stress, and child welfare system
    involvement. The finding that trauma history predicts poorer outcomes reflects healthcare system failures
    to provide trauma-informed care at scale. Equity implications: youth from marginalized communities
    disproportionately experience trauma exposure, compounding treatment disparities.'
