mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to intimate partner violence creates psychological trauma, stress,
  and negative emotional states that require coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Individuals use alcohol as a maladaptive coping strategy to manage trauma
  symptoms, stress, depression, and emotional dysregulation resulting from IPV exposure'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol use as a coping mechanism for IPV-related trauma leads
  to the development of alcohol use disorder through tolerance, dependence, and loss
  of control'

description: Intimate partner violence exposure increases the risk of alcohol use
  disorder through psychological trauma and maladaptive coping mechanisms. IPV creates
  stress, depression, and emotional dysregulation, leading individuals to use alcohol
  as a coping strategy. This self-medication pattern can develop into alcohol use
  disorder, with longitudinal studies showing robust associations even after controlling
  for prior substance use.
structural_competency_notes: This mechanism reflects broader structural inequalities
  including gender-based violence, limited access to trauma-informed mental health
  services, social isolation from support systems, and inadequate community resources
  for IPV survivors. Structural factors such as economic dependence, legal barriers,
  and stigma may limit help-seeking behavior, increasing reliance on alcohol as a
  readily available coping mechanism.
