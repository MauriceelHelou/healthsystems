description: High-functioning occasional heavy drinkers demonstrated higher purpose in life compared to
  both poor-functioning profiles, suggesting purpose in life differentiates functional recovery regardless
  of drinking pattern.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 806
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Purpose in life is shaped by access to meaningful employment, education, social
    connections, and community engagement—all influenced by structural factors. Addressing social determinants
    that support purpose and meaning may be as important as addressing drinking behavior directly.
