mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-waivered NPs/PAs express concerns about buprenorphine affecting their patient mix'
- 'Step 2: These concerns reflect stigmatization of patients with opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 3: Provider stigma creates reluctance to obtain waiver and prescribe buprenorphine'
- 'Step 4: Reduced provider willingness limits treatment capacity'
- 'Step 5: Stigma-driven provider avoidance reduces access to evidence-based OUD treatment'

description: Provider stigmatization of OUD patients, manifested as concerns about how treating OUD patients
  will affect practice patient mix, creates barriers to providers obtaining waivers and prescribing buprenorphine

  description: Non-waivered practitioners were more likely than waivered practitioners to have concerns
    about patient mix, suggesting stigma as barrier to obtaining waiver
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies institutionalized stigma within healthcare as a structural
    barrier. Provider concerns about 'patient mix' reflect broader societal stigmatization of people with
    OUD that becomes embedded in clinical practice decisions. Addressing this requires systemic anti-stigma
    interventions in healthcare education and practice culture, not individual blame.
