mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Previous license suspensions indicate prior involvement with legal/regulatory systems around
  driving'
- 'Step 2: Suspension history may reflect ongoing risk patterns or limited alternative transport options'
- 'Step 3: Those with suspension history continue to drive due to treatment access needs despite legal
  barriers'
- 'Step 4: History of suspension showed 8.95 times higher odds of recent driving offences'

description: OAT clients with history of license suspension showed dramatically higher odds of recent
  driving offences, suggesting a cyclical pattern where legal penalties fail to address underlying transport
  needs.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: License suspension as punishment fails to address the structural need for transport
    to access mandated treatment. This creates a catch-22 where clients must choose between treatment
    compliance and legal compliance. The punitive approach criminalizes those already marginalized by
    addiction rather than providing transport solutions. Gender differences (males 1.87x higher odds)
    may reflect differential enforcement or transport access patterns.
