- 'Step 1: Menthol tobacco products are removed from retail display'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents observe absence of menthol products during shopping experiences'
- 'Step 3: Perceived prevalence of menthol cigarette use (descriptive norms) may shift based on product
  visibility'
- 'Step 4: However, this pathway was NOT statistically significant as a mediator'

description: Descriptive norms (perceptions of how common a behavior is) were examined as a potential
  mediator but were NOT found to significantly mediate the relationship between menthol display removal
  and smoking intentions.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The null finding for descriptive norms is important for policy design - it suggests
    that the pathway through which retail environment changes affect youth smoking intentions operates
    primarily through perceptions of social approval (injunctive norms) rather than perceptions of behavior
    prevalence. This informs how complementary public health communications should be designed.
