mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social contexts normalize competitive alcohol consumption through structured drinking games'
- 'Step 2: Game rules encourage rapid consumption exceeding safe limits'
- 'Step 3: Peer pressure within game context reduces individual ability to self-regulate intake'
- 'Step 4: Acute alcohol toxicity develops requiring emergency medical intervention'

description: Other alcoholic drinking games (beyond NekNomination and binge drinking) caused 23.8% (107/450)
  of acute alcohol intoxication hospitalizations among young people aged 15-23. This demonstrates that
  structured social activities promoting excessive alcohol consumption are significant drivers of alcohol-related
  emergency department visits.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Drinking games represent socially-embedded practices that create structural pressure
    for dangerous consumption. Addressing this requires understanding youth social environments and developing
    community-level interventions rather than individual counseling alone.
