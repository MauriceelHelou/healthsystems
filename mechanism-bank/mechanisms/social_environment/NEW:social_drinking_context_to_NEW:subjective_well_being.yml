description: Individuals report being happier on days when drinking more, with language on these days
  predominantly describing socializing with friends. This finding suggests the apparent well-being benefits
  of moderate drinking are largely explained by the social context in which alcohol is consumed rather
  than pharmacological effects of alcohol.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights that social infrastructure and community connections
    mediate the relationship between alcohol consumption and well-being. The protective effect comes from
    social environments, not alcohol itself. This has implications for policies that promote social connectivity
    and community spaces as alternatives to drinking venues.
