structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The study demonstrates structural awareness by anticipating how a well-intentioned
    public health policy could have unintended negative effects on already disinvested communities. This
    reflects understanding that structural interventions operate within complex systems where removing
    one element (liquor stores) may disrupt other functions (retail access) in neighborhoods already facing
    resource scarcity. The equity implication is that predominantly low-income communities of color may
    bear disproportionate burden of unintended consequences without adequate mitigation.
