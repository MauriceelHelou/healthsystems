mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Firearm violence incidents result in acute traumatic injuries requiring
  immediate emergency medical care'
- 'Step 2: Gunshot wound victims are transported to emergency departments for stabilization
  and treatment of potentially life-threatening injuries'
- 'Step 3: Secondary ED utilization occurs as victims return for follow-up care, wound
  complications, and treatment of psychological trauma'
- 'Step 4: Community-level firearm violence exposure increases ED visits for related
  mental health crises, anxiety, and trauma responses among witnesses and community
  members'
- 'Step 5: Areas with higher firearm violence rates experience sustained elevated
  ED utilization patterns affecting both direct victims and affected populations'

description: Firearm violence directly increases emergency department utilization
  through acute traumatic injury care needs. The scoping review identified firearm
  violence as a rapidly growing area of social emergency medicine research, with studies
  documenting the relationship between firearm injuries and ED visits. The influence
  of social determinants on ED utilization patterns was noted across multiple topic
  areas including firearm violence.
