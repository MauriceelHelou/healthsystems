mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to disasters and mass casualty incidents causes physical, economic,
  and social injuries to affected populations'
- 'Step 2: These injuries lead to development of mental disorders including anxiety,
  stress, and depression'
- 'Step 3: Persistent psychological distress and mental health deterioration increase
  suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Elevated suicidal ideation translates into increased suicide attempt behaviors,
  with prevalence of 8.8% among disaster-exposed populations'

description: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of 33 studies (n=61,180) demonstrates
  that exposure to disasters and mass casualty incidents is associated with elevated
  suicide attempt rates. The pooled prevalence of suicide attempts after disaster
  exposure was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.6%-11.0%), while suicidal ideation prevalence was 12.9%.
  The mechanism operates through physical, economic, and social injuries that trigger
  mental health disorders including anxiety, stress, and depression, which subsequently
  increase suicidal behaviors.'
