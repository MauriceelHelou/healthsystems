- 'Step 1: Inadequate mental health education in schools and communities leads to poor mental health literacy'
- 'Step 2: Emerging adults lack knowledge to recognize symptoms of mental health conditions'

  equity_implications: This reflects systemic failure in educational institutions to incorporate mental
    health literacy. The solution lies in policy-level changes to educational curricula rather than expecting
    individuals to self-educate. Structural intervention through school-based mental health education
    could address this gap.
