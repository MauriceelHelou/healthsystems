- 'Step 1: People living with HIV (PLWH) experience stigma from healthcare providers, communities, and
  structural discrimination'
- 'Step 2: Stigma intersects with existing structural inequalities and cultural discrimination'
- 'Step 3: HIV-related stigma creates chronic psychological stress and emotional distress'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress and social marginalization contribute to anxiety symptom development'
- 'Step 5: Anxiety disorders manifest at higher rates among stigmatized PLWH'

description: PLWH who had been diagnosed with anxiety were 1.89 times more likely to report HIV-related
  stigma. The relationship reflects how structural stigma and discrimination against PLWH creates chronic
  stress that manifests as anxiety disorders.

  description: Higher levels of social support were associated with lower likelihood of reporting HIV-related
    stigma, suggesting protective buffering effect
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces HIV-related anxiety to structural stigma rather than individual
    vulnerability. The paper explicitly notes that stigma intersects with structural inequalities and
    healthcare provider discrimination, emphasizing systemic rather than individual-level causes. Interventions
    should target structural stigma reduction and mental health support systems.
