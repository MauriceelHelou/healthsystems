direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: RRT creates ongoing need for medical and practical support'
- 'Step 2: Economic barriers from unemployment limit financial independence'
- 'Step 3: Health insurance dependence may require remaining on family coverage'
- 'Step 4: Housing market barriers and need for accessible accommodations limit options'
- 'Step 5: Young adults on RRT are more likely to remain living in family home rather than achieving residential
  independence'

    insurance access issues, and inadequate disability support systems create compounding barriers.
