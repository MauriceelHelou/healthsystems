- 'Step 1: Cumulative ACEs during childhood create neurobiological changes affecting stress response and
  behavioral regulation'
- 'Step 2: Youth with high ACE scores demonstrate increased behavioral dysregulation and risk-taking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: School discipline systems disproportionately punish trauma-related behaviors, feeding school-to-prison
  pipeline'
- 'Step 4: Initial justice involvement combined with unaddressed trauma increases vulnerability to repeated
  offending'
- 'Step 5: Youth courts without ACE screening fail to identify and appropriately treat underlying trauma,
  perpetuating cycle'

description: The meta-analysis specifically found that the ACE-recidivism relationship was statistically
  significant only in youth subgroups, highlighting the particular vulnerability of justice-involved young
  people with trauma histories. This finding has direct policy implications for juvenile justice systems
  implementing trauma-informed approaches and ACE screening protocols.

  description: Youth samples showed significant ACE-recidivism relationship while adult samples (n=1,204)
    did not, suggesting developmental sensitivity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how youth justice systems can either perpetuate or interrupt
    cycles of trauma and incarceration. The differential effect by age suggests that youth represent a
    critical intervention window where structural changes to court processes (ACE screening, trauma-informed
    diversion) could have outsized impact. The structural determinants of ACEs (poverty, community violence,
    family instability) are themselves products of policy choices around social safety nets, housing,
    and economic opportunity. Addressing youth recidivism requires upstream investment in ACE prevention
    alongside downstream trauma-informed justice reform.
