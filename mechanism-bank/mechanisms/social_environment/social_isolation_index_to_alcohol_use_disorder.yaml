- 'Step 1: Social isolation increases psychological distress, loneliness, and perceived
  stress levels'
- 'Step 2: Isolated individuals use alcohol as a coping mechanism to manage negative
  emotional states and stress'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol use as self-medication progresses to alcohol use disorder,
  particularly among those with high loneliness scores'

description: Social isolation increases the risk of alcohol use disorder through psychological
  distress and loneliness-mediated pathways. Longitudinal studies demonstrate that
  individuals with high loneliness scores are significantly more likely to progress
  from low-risk to high-risk drinking patterns. The mechanism involves using alcohol
  as a maladaptive coping strategy to manage the emotional burden of social disconnection.
structural_competency_notes: Social isolation reflects broader structural inequalities
  including housing instability, economic disadvantage, and lack of social support
  systems. Veterans and marginalized populations face particular structural barriers
  to social connection, making them more vulnerable to alcohol use as a coping mechanism.
