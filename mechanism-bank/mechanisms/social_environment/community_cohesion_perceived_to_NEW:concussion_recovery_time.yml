description: Social and community context is identified as a social determinant of health that may impact
  clinical recovery from concussion. Stronger community support systems likely facilitate better adherence
  to recovery protocols and provide resources that aid healing.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Social and community context reflects the accumulated effects of historical policies
    including residential segregation, community disinvestment, and social infrastructure decay. Communities
    with strong social cohesion have typically benefited from sustained public and private investment.
    Differential recovery outcomes by community context thus trace to structural decisions about resource
    allocation rather than individual social choices.
