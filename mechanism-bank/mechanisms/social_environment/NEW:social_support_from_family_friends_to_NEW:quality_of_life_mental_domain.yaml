- 'Step 1: Social support from family and friends provides emotional validation, practical
  assistance, and a sense of belonging that buffers against psychological distress'
- 'Step 2: Supportive social networks encourage recovery-oriented behaviors and provide
  accountability, reducing isolation and hopelessness common in substance use disorder
  populations'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced coping resources and reduced stress perception translate to improved
  subjective mental well-being and quality of life in the mental health domain'

description: 'A meta-analysis of 4 studies (n=1126 participants) found that patients
  with substance use disorders who received support from family or friends (social
  networks) had significantly better mental quality of life compared to those without
  such support. The pooled odds ratio of 1.05 (95% CI: 1.04-1.07) indicates a modest
  but statistically significant positive association between social support and mental
  QoL domain scores.'
