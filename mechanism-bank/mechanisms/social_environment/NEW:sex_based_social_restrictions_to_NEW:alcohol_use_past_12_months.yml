- 'Step 1: Gender-specific social norms impose stricter restrictions on female alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Women face greater social stigma and consequences for alcohol use in many Eastern Mediterranean
  societies'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to alcohol venues and social contexts where drinking occurs for women'
- 'Step 4: Female alcohol use prevalence is approximately 70% lower than male prevalence'

description: Gendered social norms create differential structural barriers to alcohol use, with women
  facing stricter prohibitions. Male 12-month alcohol use prevalence is 9.5% (95% CI 6.4-13.7%) compared
  to 2.8% (95% CI 1.3-5.5%) among females, demonstrating how structural gender dynamics shape substance
  use patterns.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Sex differences may vary across the 22 countries studied, reflecting different levels
    of gender-based restrictions on alcohol access
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how gender-based social structures create differential
    exposure to alcohol. While this may appear protective for women's alcohol-related harms, it reflects
    broader patterns of gendered social control. An equity lens recognizes that these same structural
    forces may limit women's autonomy in other domains.
