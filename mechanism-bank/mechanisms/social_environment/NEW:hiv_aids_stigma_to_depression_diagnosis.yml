structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Depression in PLWHA is not simply an individual psychological response but is structurally
    produced through societal discrimination and lack of supportive infrastructure. The root cause is
    inadequate public education and discriminatory social norms, not individual vulnerability. Addressing
    this requires structural interventions including anti-stigma campaigns and community education.
