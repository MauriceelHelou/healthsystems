direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community-wide interventions are implemented across schools, sporting clubs, police, retail
  premises, and media'
- 'Step 2: Environmental modifications aim to reduce access, change social norms, and increase enforcement'
- 'Step 3: Target population is exposed to coordinated messaging and policy changes'
- 'Step 4: Binge drinking rates are measured at population level'

description: Whole-of-community interventions showed no statistically significant impact on binge drinking
  rates (RR=0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.06), indicating that while these structural interventions may reduce risky
  drinking patterns, they do not effectively prevent episodic heavy drinking episodes at the population
  level.

  description: High risk of bias across studies may attenuate or obscure true effects

  equity_implications: The null finding for binge drinking despite positive effects on risky drinking
    (AUDIT>8) suggests that different drinking patterns may require different structural interventions.
    Binge drinking may be more resistant to community-level interventions and may require additional policy
    mechanisms such as pricing controls or more intensive enforcement.
