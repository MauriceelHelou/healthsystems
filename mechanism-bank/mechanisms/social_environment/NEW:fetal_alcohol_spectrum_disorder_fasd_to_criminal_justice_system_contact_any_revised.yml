direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FASD causes deficits in cognition, memory, language, executive functioning, and adaptive functioning'
- 'Step 2: These neurodevelopmental deficits increase vulnerability to suggestibility and confabulation
  during legal interviews'
- 'Step 3: Suggestibility leads to impulsive Miranda rights waivers and potential false confessions'
- 'Step 4: Confabulation results in inaccurate or incomplete information gathering and misinterpretation
  of intent'
- 'Step 5: These factors lead to wrongful convictions, probation/parole violations, and deeper criminal
  justice involvement'

description: Individuals with FASD face elevated risk of adverse criminal justice outcomes due to neurodevelopmental
  deficits that increase suggestibility and confabulation during legal interviews, leading to false confessions,
  competency issues, and probation violations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how a disability caused by prenatal alcohol exposure
    intersects with criminal justice system practices that are not designed to accommodate neurodevelopmental
    differences. The structural failure lies in criminal justice systems that assume neurotypical cognitive
    functioning, leading to systematic disadvantages for individuals with FASD. This is not individual
    blame but rather a systems-level failure to provide appropriate accommodations and training.
