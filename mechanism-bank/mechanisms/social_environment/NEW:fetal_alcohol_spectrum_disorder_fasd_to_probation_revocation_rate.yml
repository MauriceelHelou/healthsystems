direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FASD causes deficits in executive functioning and adaptive functioning'
- 'Step 2: Executive dysfunction impairs ability to plan, organize, and follow complex probation requirements'
- 'Step 3: Memory deficits lead to forgetting appointments and compliance deadlines'
- 'Step 4: Court ordered treatment completion problems arise due to cognitive and adaptive challenges'
- 'Step 5: These functional impairments result in technical probation and parole violations'

description: Individuals with FASD experience higher rates of probation and parole violations due to executive
  functioning and adaptive deficits that impair their ability to comply with complex supervision requirements.

  description: Probation and parole supervision that accounts for FASD-related deficits can reduce technical
    violations through appropriate accommodations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The probation and parole system's standard requirements assume neurotypical functioning
    and do not accommodate neurodevelopmental disabilities like FASD. This structural mismatch criminalizes
    disability-related behaviors rather than providing appropriate support, perpetuating cycles of incarceration
    for individuals whose prenatal environment was shaped by structural determinants of maternal health.
