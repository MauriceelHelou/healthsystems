- 'Step 1: Composite structural racism index captures five interconnected dimensions: residential segregation,
  employment inequity, economic inequity, incarceration disparities, and educational inequity'
- 'Step 2: These interconnected systems of racial hierarchy create cumulative disadvantage affecting multiple
  life domains for Black Americans'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative structural disadvantage produces chronic stress, limited opportunities, and reduced
  access to health-promoting resources'
- 'Step 4: Elevated psychosocial stress and limited alternative coping resources increase vulnerability
  to alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: More frequent alcohol use emerges as a population-level response to structural conditions'

description: State-level structural racism, measured as a composite index of five interconnected dimensions
  (residential segregation, employment, economic, incarceration, and educational inequities), is associated
  with alcohol use frequency among Black Americans. This reflects how interconnected racist systems produce
  conditions that increase population-level alcohol use.
quantitative_effects:

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study design explicitly examines state-level variation through hierarchical models
    accounting for participant clustering at state level
moderators:
- name: state_clustering
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Hierarchical models account for participant clustering at the state level, suggesting state
    context moderates individual-level associations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The composite index approach recognizes that structural racism operates through
    multiple, interconnected systems rather than isolated factors. This avoids reductionist explanations
    and appropriately situates alcohol use within broader structures of racial inequality. The study explicitly
    theorizes structural racism as promoting substance use, centering root causes rather than individual
    behavior.
