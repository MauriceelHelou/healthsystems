description: 35% of transgender participants in public mental health facilities were documented as using
  tobacco products, reflecting the high burden of tobacco use in this population. The Minority Stress
  Model suggests this elevated prevalence stems from discrimination and violence experienced by transgender
  individuals.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 1387
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: High tobacco use rates in transgender populations reflect structural factors including
    discrimination and lack of affirming healthcare, not individual moral failings. Tobacco use serves
    as a coping mechanism in the context of chronic minority stress from societal stigma.
