structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While interpersonal in nature, these attitudes reflect broader societal stigma
    and cultural norms around mental health. Structural interventions targeting community-level mental
    health education could shift social network attitudes. This mechanism does not blame individuals but
    recognizes the social embeddedness of healthcare decisions.
