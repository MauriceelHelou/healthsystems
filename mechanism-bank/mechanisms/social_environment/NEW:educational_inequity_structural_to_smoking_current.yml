mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The education dimension of structural racism captures disparities in educational attainment
  and resources between Black and white populations at the state level'
- 'Step 2: Paradoxically, in states with greater educational inequity, there may be stronger health-protective
  social networks and community resilience among Black populations'
- 'Step 3: Alternative interpretation: states with documented educational inequity may have implemented
  more targeted tobacco control interventions in Black communities'
- 'Step 4: Complex interplay between structural factors may result in inverse associations that require
  further investigation'
- 'Step 5: Lower smoking prevalence observed in states with higher educational inequity dimension scores'

description: An inverse association was detected between the education dimension of structural racism
  and smoking status. This unexpected finding suggests complex relationships between different dimensions
  of structural racism and health behaviors that may involve unmeasured confounders or protective community
  factors.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: State-level variation in the education dimension of structural racism shows inverse
    relationship with smoking, contrasting with other dimensions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This inverse finding highlights the complexity of structural racism's health effects.
    It does not suggest educational inequity is protective, but rather that the mechanisms through which
    different dimensions of structural racism affect health behaviors may operate through distinct pathways
    requiring further investigation.
