description: Cross-lagged longitudinal analysis found that only authoritative parenting showed a significant
  effect on subsequent decline in substance use (r = -0.06). This provides stronger evidence for the causal
  direction of the association, suggesting authoritative parenting actively reduces substance use over
  time rather than simply correlating with lower use.

    associations may also apply to longitudinal effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The longitudinal evidence strengthens the case that family environment shapes substance
    use trajectories. However, the small effect size (r = -0.06) indicates that parenting style alone
    has modest impact, and broader structural factors (economic conditions, community resources, school
    environments) likely play substantial roles. Policies should support families holistically rather
    than focusing narrowly on parenting education.
