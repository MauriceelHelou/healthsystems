- 'Step 1: Probation populations show 53-69% alcohol use disorder prevalence'
- 'Step 2: Community supervision creates ongoing stress and surveillance'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related probation violations may lead to incarceration rather than treatment'
- 'Step 4: Limited integration of evidence-based AUD treatment within probation services'

description: In UK probation settings, 53-69% of individuals screened positive for alcohol use disorder,
  highlighting the community supervision system as another point where AUD prevalence far exceeds general
  population rates.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Probation could serve as a community-based intervention point for AUD, but the
    review found limited evidence for brief intervention effectiveness in this setting. This represents
    a structural gap where the criminal justice system identifies but fails to effectively treat alcohol
    disorders.
