description: Most vendors (70%) were aware of tobacco-related harms of naswar, yet compliance with sales
  regulations remained poor. This suggests that knowledge of health harms alone is insufficient to change
  vendor behavior without structural policy enforcement mechanisms.

  equity_implications: The disconnect between harm awareness and compliance highlights that individual
    knowledge interventions are insufficient without structural enforcement. This finding supports policies
    focusing on regulatory systems rather than education-only approaches that place responsibility on
    individual actors.
