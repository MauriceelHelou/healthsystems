- 'Step 1: Adverse childhood experiences (childhood trauma, abuse, neglect) create
  lasting psychological vulnerabilities and disrupt healthy emotional development'
- 'Step 2: These historical interpersonal factors contribute to the development of
  personality disorders and other mental health conditions'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with ACEs and resultant personality pathology may develop maladaptive
  coping mechanisms including substance use'
- 'Step 4: The combination of early trauma, personality dysfunction, and comorbid
  substance use facilitates ideation-to-enaction processes'
- 'Step 5: These cumulative risk factors significantly elevate the likelihood of suicide
  attempts'

description: This systematic review of 34 studies identifies historical interpersonal
  factors, specifically childhood trauma (a core component of ACEs), as commonly associated
  with suicide attempt and death outcomes. The review found that childhood trauma
  contributes to personality disorder development, which in turn substantially elevates
  suicide risk compared to populations without personality disorders or with other
  mental health conditions.
