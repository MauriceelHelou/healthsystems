description: The review identified stigma and perception of ill treatment by others as correlates and
  predictors of loneliness among people with substance use problems, highlighting the role of social attitudes
  in perpetuating isolation.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Stigma is a structural factor rooted in societal attitudes, policies (e.g., criminalization
    of substance use), and institutional practices that marginalize people with substance use disorders.
    Addressing loneliness requires structural interventions that reduce stigma rather than focusing solely
    on individual-level coping.
