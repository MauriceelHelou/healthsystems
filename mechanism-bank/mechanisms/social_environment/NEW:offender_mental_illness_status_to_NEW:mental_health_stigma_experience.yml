direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with criminal justice involvement and mental illness face dual stigmatization from
  both labels'
- 'Step 2: Public attitudes compound negative perceptions when mental illness and offender status intersect'
- 'Step 3: Stigmatic attitudes manifest as discrimination in social interactions, employment, and healthcare
  settings'
- 'Step 4: Compounded stigma creates barriers to recovery, treatment engagement, and social reintegration'

description: Systematic review of 12 studies found that offenders with mental illness elicit more negative
  stigmatic attitudes than offenders without mental illness or individuals with neither condition. The
  intersection of criminal justice involvement and mental health status creates compounded stigma that
  affects recovery and treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural systems (criminal justice and mental health
    labeling) create intersecting stigmas. The stigma is not an individual failing but emerges from societal
    attitudes toward both incarceration and mental illness. Addressing this requires structural interventions
    in public education, policy reform, and anti-discrimination protections rather than individual-level
    interventions.
