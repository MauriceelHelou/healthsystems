- 'Step 1: Fear of stigmatization leads affected individuals to conceal symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Concealment delays initial presentation to healthcare services'
- 'Step 3: Delayed care allows disease progression and increased transmission to others'
- 'Step 4: Advanced disease at presentation results in more severe outcomes and complications'

description: Leprosy-related stigma creates social barriers to care seeking, leading to delayed diagnosis
  and treatment which increases disease severity and transmission.
spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: Evidence from Nepal, India, and Indonesia; relationship between stigma and care seeking
    may vary by healthcare system accessibility and cultural factors.

  description: Stigma as barrier is more significant where healthcare services are geographically and
    financially accessible but social barriers remain
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how social structures (stigma) create health inequities
    independent of individual decision-making. Delayed care is not a personal failure but a predictable
    response to structural discrimination. Reducing stigma is a public health intervention with population-level
    benefits.
