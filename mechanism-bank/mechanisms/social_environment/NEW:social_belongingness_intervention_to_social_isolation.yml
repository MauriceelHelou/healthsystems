description: Social belongingness interventions within nature-based social prescription programs show
  significant effects on mental health by reducing social isolation through structured group activities
  in natural settings.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Social isolation is a structural health determinant shaped by urban design, housing
    patterns, and economic factors. Nature-based social belongingness interventions address these structural
    roots by creating accessible community spaces and programs that facilitate social connection independent
    of individual resources.
