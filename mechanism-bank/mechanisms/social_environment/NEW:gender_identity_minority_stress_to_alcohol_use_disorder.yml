mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transfeminine individuals experience higher levels of violence and discrimination compared
  to transmasculine individuals'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure to discrimination activates stress response systems and increases psychological
  distress'
- 'Step 3: Minority stress leads to maladaptive coping mechanisms including increased alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Sustained hazardous alcohol use progresses to alcohol-related disorder diagnosis'

description: Transfeminine adults experience higher rates of alcohol-related disorders compared to transmasculine
  adults, likely due to greater exposure to discrimination and violence as predicted by the Minority Stress
  Model. This differential exposure to minority stressors creates disparate substance use outcomes between
  gender identity subgroups.

    disorders relative to transmasculine adults
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies structural discrimination and violence against transgender
    individuals as root causes of substance use disorders, rather than attributing outcomes to individual
    behavior. The Minority Stress Model framework explicitly traces health disparities to societal stigma
    and systemic mistreatment of marginalized communities.
