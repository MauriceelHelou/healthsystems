- 'Step 1: Young people from ethnic minority backgrounds face structural barriers to substance use treatment
  engagement'
- 'Step 2: Cultural incongruence between treatment approaches and minority youth experiences reduces treatment
  relevance'
- 'Step 3: Discrimination and stigma compound substance use stigma for minority youth'
- 'Step 4: These structural barriers contribute to poorer treatment retention and outcomes in substance
  use disorders'

description: Ethnic minority status may predict poorer outcomes in psychotherapeutic interventions for
  young people with substance use disorders, one of the most frequently studied disorder groups in this
  systematic review. This reflects structural inequities in substance use treatment systems.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Substance use disorder treatment systems historically developed with limited attention
    to cultural competence and the social determinants that drive substance use in minority communities.
    The structural inequities in SUD treatment mirror broader healthcare disparities. Addressing this
    requires culturally-adapted interventions, diverse treatment workforce, and addressing root causes
    of substance use in marginalized communities.
