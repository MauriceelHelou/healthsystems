structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural factors including inadequate public health
    education about HIV/AIDS and systemic discrimination rather than individual behaviors. The stigma
    is produced by societal lack of knowledge and understanding, which is a failure of public health infrastructure
    and education systems. Equity implications include disproportionate impact on marginalized populations
    who may have less access to accurate health information and supportive resources.
