mechanism_pathway:
  - 'Step 1: High neighborhood poverty concentrates chronic stressors including economic insecurity, violence exposure, and hopelessness'
  - 'Step 2: Concentrated disadvantage creates higher alcohol outlet density through targeted marketing and zoning inequities'
  - 'Step 3: Limited economic opportunity and chronic stress drive alcohol use as accessible coping mechanism for structural suffering'
  - 'Step 4: Erosion of community institutions (recreation, youth programs, employment services) removes protective factors and alternatives'
  - 'Step 5: Cumulative exposure to poverty-related adversity combined with easy alcohol access increases AUD prevalence in high-poverty areas'

  equity_implications: Neighborhood poverty is not a natural condition but the result of deliberate policy choices about residential segregation, discriminatory lending, zoning, tax policy, and public investment. Concentrated poverty in communities of color reflects historical redlining and ongoing structural racism. The alcohol industry deliberately targets high-poverty neighborhoods with dense outlet placement and aggressive marketing, extracting resources while contributing to harm. High AUD in poor neighborhoods represents structural violence—predictable health harm from unjust social arrangements. Addressing this requires transformative policies: equitable school funding, living wage jobs, affordable housing, alcohol outlet density restrictions, and community reinvestment—not individual addiction treatment alone.
assumptions:
  - 'Neighborhood poverty assessed at census tract or ZIP code level'
  - 'Mechanism operates through both material deprivation and psychosocial stress pathways'
  - 'Assumes sustained exposure to neighborhood poverty over years'
limitations:
  - 'Individual SES may confound neighborhood effects'
  - 'Selective migration may influence who lives in high-poverty areas'
  - 'Protective factors create resilience despite neighborhood poverty'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Poverty concentration varies dramatically by region, shaped by historical segregation and contemporary disinvestment patterns
  relevant_geographies:
    - 'Formerly redlined urban neighborhoods show persistent concentrated poverty and elevated AUD'
    - 'Rust Belt cities experiencing deindustrialization concentrate poverty and substance use'
    - 'Rural poverty areas face different mechanisms (isolation, limited treatment) than urban poverty'
    - 'Native American reservations experience severe concentrated poverty from historical dispossession'
