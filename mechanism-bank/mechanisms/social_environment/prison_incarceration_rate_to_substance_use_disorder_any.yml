direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural factors including poverty, housing instability, and limited economic opportunity
  increase vulnerability to drug use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Drug policy and enforcement patterns disproportionately criminalize substance use in marginalized
  communities'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate community mental health and substance use treatment infrastructure leaves individuals
  without alternatives to the criminal justice system'
- 'Step 4: Drug use disorders are concentrated among newly incarcerated populations, with prevalence at
  least as high as AUD in men and higher in women'

description: Meta-analysis found drug use disorder prevalence at least as high as alcohol use disorder
  (24%) in incarcerated men, and higher in incarcerated women. This concentration reflects structural
  pathways whereby drug policy criminalizes addiction rather than treating it as a health condition.

  description: Drug use disorder prevalence was higher in incarcerated women compared to men, suggesting
    gender-specific pathways to incarceration involving substance use

  equity_implications: The finding that drug use disorders are at least as prevalent as AUD (and higher
    in women) highlights how drug enforcement policies funnel individuals with substance use problems
    into the criminal justice system. Women's higher rates may reflect gendered pathways including trauma,
    economic marginalization, and relationships with drug-involved partners. Structural reforms including
    decriminalization and treatment expansion could redirect these populations to health services.
