description: This systematic review of 41 studies found that loneliness is prevalent among people with
  substance use problems and is related to substance use patterns. The bidirectional relationship suggests
  loneliness may both contribute to and result from substance use.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how social environmental factors (stigma, quality of
    relationships, perception of ill treatment) create structural conditions that perpetuate loneliness
    among people with substance use problems. The finding that only one loneliness intervention has been
    trialed for this population indicates systemic gaps in addressing social determinants of recovery.
