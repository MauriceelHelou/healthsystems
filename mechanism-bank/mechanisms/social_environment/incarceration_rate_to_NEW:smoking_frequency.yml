direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State-level incarceration disparities reflect systematic racial bias in criminal justice contact,
  arrest, prosecution, and sentencing'
- 'Step 2: High incarceration rates create community-wide collateral consequences including family separation,
  economic instability, and social stigma'
- 'Step 3: Community trauma and chronic stress from concentrated incarceration elevate cortisol and inflammatory
  markers'
- 'Step 4: Nicotine provides temporary stress relief, and tobacco industry has targeted communities experiencing
  chronic stress'
- 'Step 5: Both initiation of smoking and increased smoking frequency result from structural conditions
  created by incarceration disparities'

description: The incarceration dimension of structural racism is positively associated with smoking frequency
  among Black Americans. Those living in states with greater incarceration disparities smoke more frequently,
  reflecting the dose-response relationship between structural racism exposure and tobacco use intensity.

  variation_notes: Associations vary by state-level incarceration disparities, highlighting geographic
    variation in structural racism's health effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes smoking frequency as a population-level response to structural
    conditions rather than individual choice. It traces the pathway from racist criminal justice policies
    through community-level effects to individual health behaviors, maintaining focus on root causes and
    avoiding victim-blaming.
