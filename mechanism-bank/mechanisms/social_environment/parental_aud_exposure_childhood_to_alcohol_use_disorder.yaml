mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parental alcohol use disorder during childhood creates environmental exposure
  through modeling of drinking behaviors, normalization of alcohol use, and potential
  genetic predisposition transmission'
- 'Step 2: Childhood exposure leads to maladaptive coping mechanisms, increased stress
  vulnerability, disrupted family relationships, and early initiation of alcohol experimentation'
- 'Step 3: These developmental disruptions and learned behaviors culminate in increased
  risk for developing alcohol use disorder in adulthood through both behavioral modeling
  and neurobiological vulnerability pathways'

description: Parental alcohol use disorder during childhood increases offspring risk
  for developing alcohol use disorder through multiple pathways including genetic
  transmission, environmental modeling, disrupted family relationships, and compromised
  stress-coping mechanisms. The genetic risk adoption study demonstrates both genetic
  and rearing effects, with hazard ratios of 1.25 for combined genetic and rearing
  exposure, 1.16 for genetic effects alone, and 1.08 for rearing effects alone, indicating
  that both biological and environmental factors contribute to transmission.
structural_competency_notes: This pathway is influenced by structural factors including
  socioeconomic status, access to mental health services, family support systems,
  and community-level alcohol availability and norms. Interventions should address
  both individual family dynamics and broader social determinants that perpetuate
  intergenerational transmission of alcohol use disorders.
