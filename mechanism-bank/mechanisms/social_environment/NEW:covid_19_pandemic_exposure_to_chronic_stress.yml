  equity_implications: Pandemic-related stress is rooted in structural vulnerabilities including weak
    social safety nets, precarious employment conditions, overcrowded housing, and inadequate public health
    infrastructure. The high burden in Bangladesh reflects the compound effects of poverty and pandemic
    on population mental health.
