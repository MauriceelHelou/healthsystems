direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use on school property (41.7% of challenges) creates acute management demands'
- 'Step 2: School administrators report feeling unequipped and ineffective in current approaches despite
  willingness to act'
- 'Step 3: Time spent on reactive substance use responses (>5 hours weekly at secondary level) reduces
  capacity for proactive health promotion'
- 'Step 4: Lack of developmentally informed, evidence-aligned strategies perpetuates ineffective responses'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies systemic failures in providing school administrators
    with evidence-based tools and training rather than framing students or administrators as deficient.
    The 64.7% willingness to change practices indicates structural barriers to implementation rather than
    attitudinal resistance. Findings call for developmentally informed strategies - a structural/policy
    response rather than punitive individual-level interventions.
