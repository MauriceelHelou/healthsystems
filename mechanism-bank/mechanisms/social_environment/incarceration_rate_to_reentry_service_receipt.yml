- 'Step 1: High incarceration rates strain reentry service capacity and resources'
- 'Step 2: Previously incarcerated individuals with polysubstance use have complex needs requiring comprehensive
  services'
- 'Step 3: Limited substance use-related reentry services fail to meet population demand'
- 'Step 4: Gaps in reentry services contribute to recidivism and continued adverse outcomes'

description: The review identifies gaps in substance use-related services for previously incarcerated
  individuals reentering society, with polysubstance use complicating service needs and treatment outcomes

  description: Paper explicitly notes limited research focus on social determinants of health which likely
    moderate reentry success
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural failures in the reentry system rather than
    individual responsibility for reintegration challenges. The paper explicitly calls for more research
    on social determinants of health and interventions, recognizing that structural changes are needed.
    Equity implications are significant given racial/ethnic disparities in incarceration.
