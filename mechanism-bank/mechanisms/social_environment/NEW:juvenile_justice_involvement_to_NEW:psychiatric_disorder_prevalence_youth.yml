direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth in juvenile justice system often come from environments with elevated adverse childhood
  experiences and trauma'
- 'Step 2: Structural factors (poverty, family instability, limited mental health access) increase both
  justice involvement and psychiatric risk'
- 'Step 3: Nearly half (approximately 50%) of juvenile offenders on probation/parole have diagnosable
  psychiatric disorders'
- 'Step 4: High prevalence of AUD (19.17%), bipolar disorder (18.33%), ASPD (11.67%), and ADHD (10.83%)
  reflects accumulated structural disadvantage'

description: The study found that approximately half of juvenile offenders on probation or parole had
  psychiatric disorders, with alcohol use disorder (19.17%), bipolar disorder (18.33%), antisocial personality
  disorder (11.67%), and ADHD (10.83%) being most prevalent. This high burden reflects structural pathways
  whereby youth exposed to adverse social conditions are both more likely to enter the justice system
  and more likely to have untreated mental health conditions.

  equity_implications: 'The concentration of psychiatric disorders among justice-involved youth reflects
    upstream structural failures: inadequate community mental health services for adolescents, school
    systems that suspend/expel rather than treat behavioral health issues, and child welfare systems that
    fail to address trauma. The juvenile justice system effectively becomes the default mental health
    system for disadvantaged youth. Equity implications are significant as youth from marginalized communities
    face greater risk of both psychiatric disorder development and justice involvement due to structural
    racism and economic inequality.'
