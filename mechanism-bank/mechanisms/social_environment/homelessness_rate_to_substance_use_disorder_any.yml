- 'Step 1: Adolescents experiencing homelessness face chronic stress, trauma, and lack of stable living
  environments'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to mental health services, family support, and protective social structures
  increases vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Exposure to substance use in street environments and shelters normalizes drug and alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Self-medication to cope with trauma, mental health symptoms, and survival needs leads to substance
  use initiation'
- 'Step 5: Lack of treatment access and continued housing instability perpetuates substance use disorders'

  adolescents (43%), indicating that housing instability creates conditions that dramatically increase
  substance use disorder risk in vulnerable youth populations.

  description: Adolescents with existing mental health disorders are at higher risk for both homelessness
    and substance use disorders, creating bidirectional reinforcement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural failures in housing policy, youth services,
    and mental health infrastructure. Rather than individual behavioral choices, substance use among homeless
    adolescents emerges from systematic lack of safe housing, treatment access, and protective environments.
    Equity implications include disproportionate impact on youth from marginalized backgrounds who face
    higher baseline homelessness risk.
