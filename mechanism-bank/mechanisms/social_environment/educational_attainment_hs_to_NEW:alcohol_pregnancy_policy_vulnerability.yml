direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Educational attainment shapes social position and interaction with healthcare and legal systems'
- 'Step 2: Higher-educated women may face greater scrutiny or have more to lose from policy consequences'
- 'Step 3: Higher-educated women may be more likely to avoid care when policies create punitive environments'
- 'Step 4: Lower-educated women may benefit from increased attention and resources directed toward screening'
- 'Step 5: Paradoxical pattern where policy harms concentrate among higher-educated women'

description: Educational attainment moderates the effects of alcohol/pregnancy policies on birth outcomes,
  with higher education paradoxically associated with greater vulnerability to policy harms on preterm
  birth and low birthweight.

  variation_notes: Education-policy interactions vary across states based on policy type and implementation.

  description: Different alcohol/pregnancy policies (8 examined) showed varying patterns of education-based
    effect modification, suggesting policy design matters for differential impacts.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding challenges the typical assumption that higher socioeconomic status
    protects against policy harms. It suggests that policies can create unexpected patterns of inequity
    and that policy effects must be evaluated across social strata. The mechanism may involve differential
    surveillance, help-seeking behavior, or resources to avoid detection.
