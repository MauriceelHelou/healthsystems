mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High incarceration rates concentrate individuals with elevated HIV and TB risk factors'
- 'Step 2: Prison overcrowding reduces per-person living space and ventilation adequacy'
- 'Step 3: Close congregate living facilitates airborne TB transmission among immunocompromised individuals'
- 'Step 4: Limited prison healthcare infrastructure delays diagnosis and treatment of co-infections'
- 'Step 5: Elevated co-infection rates result from convergence of structural vulnerabilities'

description: Prison settings create structural conditions that amplify HIV-TB co-infection through concentration
  of high-risk populations, overcrowding, and inadequate healthcare. This systematic review documents
  wide variation in co-infection prevalence (2.4-73.1%) across prison populations globally.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Prevalence estimates varied dramatically (2.4% to 73.1%) reflecting differences in
    background disease burden, prison conditions, and healthcare systems across countries

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly traces health outcomes to structural factors including
    criminal justice policies, prison infrastructure, and healthcare system capacity. The review notes
    that few studies compare prison rates to general population rates, obscuring the degree to which incarceration
    itself produces excess co-infection burden. This represents a clear example of how structural factors
    (mass incarceration, underfunded prison health systems) rather than individual behaviors drive disease
    patterns in vulnerable populations.
