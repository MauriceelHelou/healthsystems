mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with criminal-legal system involvement have elevated rates of substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Jails and probation/parole systems serve as points of contact for identifying treatment needs'
- 'Step 3: Limited data-driven decision-making capacity in these settings results in inadequate service
  coordination'
- 'Step 4: Fragmented care perpetuates substance use disorders among justice-involved populations'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that substance use disorders among justice-involved individuals
    reflect structural factors including inadequate treatment infrastructure, criminalization of substance
    use, and systemic barriers to care. The focus is appropriately on system capacity rather than individual
    pathology. Racial and socioeconomic disparities in criminal justice involvement compound these effects.
