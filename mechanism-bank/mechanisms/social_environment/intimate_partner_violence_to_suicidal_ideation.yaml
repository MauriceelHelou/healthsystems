direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women experience intimate partner violence (physical, psychological, and/or
  sexual) which creates chronic traumatic stress and threatens physical safety and
  psychological integrity'
- 'Step 2: IPV exposure leads to development of mental health conditions including
  depression and PTSD, which are established risk factors for suicidality'
- 'Step 3: The combination of ongoing trauma, mental health deterioration, feelings
  of hopelessness, entrapment, and loss of autonomy increases vulnerability to suicidal
  ideation and behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Social isolation often accompanying IPV reduces access to protective factors
  and support systems, further elevating suicide risk'

description: Intimate partner violence significantly increases the odds of suicidality
  among women, with meta-analytic evidence showing odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to
  5.52 across different IPV types. This relationship operates through multiple pathways
  including direct trauma effects and mediated through depression and PTSD. The association
  is robust across 201 studies involving over 250,000 women globally.
