description: The review emphasizes that understanding links between loneliness and substance use is important
  for wellbeing and recovery, with loneliness experienced as problematic among people with substance use
  problems.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that only a single loneliness intervention has been trialed (and was
    not efficacious) for this population reveals a significant structural gap in evidence-based treatment
    development. This calls for systemic investment in developing and trialing interventions that meet
    specific needs of people with substance use problems.
