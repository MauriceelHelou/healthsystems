direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Conflict-related trauma events accumulate through repeated exposure to violence, displacement,
  and loss'
- 'Step 2: Cumulative trauma overwhelms psychological coping capacity and disrupts neurobiological stress
  response systems'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress activation and dysregulated HPA axis function increase vulnerability to substance
  use'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol becomes a self-medication strategy for managing trauma symptoms including hyperarousal,
  intrusive memories, and emotional numbing'
- 'Step 5: In resource-limited conflict settings, lack of alternative mental health supports reinforces
  reliance on alcohol'

description: Cumulative trauma event exposure was identified as a factor associated with harmful alcohol
  use among conflict-affected civilian populations. The dose-response relationship between accumulated
  traumatic experiences and alcohol use reflects the compounding psychological burden of conflict exposure
  in settings with limited mental health resources.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Cumulative trauma effects on alcohol use may vary based on cultural drinking norms,
    availability of alcohol, and access to mental health services across different LMIC contexts

  description: Depression co-occurring with trauma exposure strengthens the pathway to harmful alcohol
    use
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies cumulative trauma as a structural exposure created by
    armed conflict rather than individual vulnerability. The pathway emphasizes how systemic violence
    produces psychological harm that manifests as alcohol use disorder when adequate mental health infrastructure
    is absent. This avoids blaming individuals for 'poor coping' by recognizing the overwhelming nature
    of conflict-related trauma and the structural absence of treatment alternatives in LMIC conflict settings.
