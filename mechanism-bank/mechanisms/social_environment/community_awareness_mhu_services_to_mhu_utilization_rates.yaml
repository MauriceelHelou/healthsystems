direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile health units represent a novel service delivery model not widely
  known in communities with opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Limited awareness results from insufficient community outreach, communication
  infrastructure gaps, and social isolation of target populations'
- 'Step 3: Without knowledge of MHU availability, location, and services, target populations
  cannot access available treatment'
- 'Step 4: Low utilization rates persist despite availability, creating a mismatch
  between need and service uptake'
