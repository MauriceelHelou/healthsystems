mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Experience of intimate partner violence (physical, emotional, or as perpetration)
  creates patterns of interpersonal violence exposure and normalized abusive relationship
  dynamics'
- 'Step 2: IPV involvement disrupts healthy relationship schema, boundaries, and self-protective
  behaviors while potentially increasing mental health vulnerabilities (trauma symptoms,
  depression)'
- 'Step 3: These compromised protective factors and increased psychological vulnerabilities
  elevate risk for subsequent sexual assault victimization across relationship contexts'

description: This meta-analysis of 118 studies identified intimate partner violence
  as one of the strongest correlates of sexual assault victimization among U.S. college
  students. Physical IPV perpetration, physical IPV victimization, and emotional IPV
  victimization were all identified as top correlates, suggesting that both experiencing
  and perpetrating IPV significantly increases vulnerability to sexual assault. The
  relationship likely operates through disrupted interpersonal functioning, normalized
  violence in relationships, and co-occurring mental health sequelae that compromise
  protective factors.
