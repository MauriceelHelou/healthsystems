mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children are exposed to parental alcohol use patterns, observing drinking
  behaviors and attitudes toward alcohol in the family environment'
- 'Step 2: This exposure creates social modeling and normalization of alcohol use,
  while also potentially contributing to family stress and reduced parental monitoring'
- 'Step 3: These factors combine to increase the likelihood of early alcohol initiation
  before age 15 through increased availability, acceptance, and opportunity'

description: Parental alcohol use disorder exposure during childhood increases the
  likelihood of early onset drinking before age 15 through social modeling, normalization
  of alcohol use, and reduced family protective factors. Multiple longitudinal studies
  demonstrate consistent associations between parental drinking patterns and earlier
  initiation of alcohol use in offspring, with effects persisting even when accounting
  for peer influences.
structural_competency_notes: This pathway reflects broader structural inequalities
  where families affected by alcohol use disorders may have reduced access to prevention
  resources, live in communities with higher alcohol availability, and face systemic
  barriers to accessing treatment and support services that could mitigate intergenerational
  transmission of alcohol problems.
