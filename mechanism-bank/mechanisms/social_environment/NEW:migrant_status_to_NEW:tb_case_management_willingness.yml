mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Migrant populations face structural barriers including residency restrictions and limited access
  to local healthcare services'
- 'Step 2: Work instability and housing insecurity reduce ability to maintain consistent healthcare relationships'
- 'Step 3: Social marginalization and lack of trust in local healthcare systems develop'
- 'Step 4: Willingness to engage with TB case management services from PHC workers decreases'

description: Migrant TB patients demonstrate particularly low willingness to receive case management provided
  by healthcare workers in primary healthcare sectors, reflecting structural barriers faced by mobile
  populations.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how migration policies and the hukou (household registration)
    system create structural barriers to healthcare access for internal migrants in China. Low willingness
    to engage with TB services is a consequence of systemic exclusion rather than individual non-compliance.
    Addressing this requires policy changes to ensure healthcare access regardless of residency status.
