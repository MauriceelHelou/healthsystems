direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Certain diagnoses (psychopathy, schizophrenia) are associated with cultural stereotypes of
  dangerousness'
- 'Step 2: Media portrayals and public misconceptions amplify negative perceptions of these conditions'
- 'Step 3: Diagnostic labels trigger more severe stigmatic responses in interpersonal and institutional
  contexts'
- 'Step 4: Differential stigma by diagnosis creates inequitable treatment within mental health and criminal
  justice systems'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Differential stigma by diagnosis reflects socially constructed categories and cultural
    narratives about mental illness dangerousness. This is not inherent to the conditions but produced
    through media representation, policy frameworks, and institutional practices. Addressing diagnosis-specific
    stigma requires media advocacy, clinical education reform, and challenging diagnostic labeling practices
    that reinforce stereotypes.
