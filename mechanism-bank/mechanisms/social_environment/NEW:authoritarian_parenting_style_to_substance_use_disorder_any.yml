mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Authoritarian parenting involves high control but low warmth and responsiveness'
- 'Step 2: Harsh discipline without emotional support may damage parent-child relationship and communication'
- 'Step 3: Youth may rebel against rigid control or seek emotional coping through peer groups'
- 'Step 4: Reduced open communication prevents effective dialogue about substance use risks'
- 'Step 5: Slightly increased substance use in offspring'

description: Meta-analysis found a very small positive correlation between authoritarian parenting (low
  warmth, high control) and offspring substance use. The effect size of r=0.03 with confidence interval
  touching zero indicates this is a minimal and marginally significant association.

  description: Associations may be stronger or weaker depending on cultural norms regarding parental authority
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Authoritarian parenting styles may be more common in contexts where parents face
    external threats (neighborhood violence, discrimination) and perceive strict control as protective.
    Cultural values around respect for authority also influence this parenting approach. The minimal effect
    size suggests this is not a major driver of substance use outcomes.
