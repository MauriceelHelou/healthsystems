direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with SUDs experience perceived social stigma from family, community, employers,
  and healthcare providers'
- 'Step 2: Stigma experiences negatively impact feelings and beliefs about treatment seeking and engagement'
- 'Step 3: Negative emotions (shame, guilt) and reduced self-efficacy mediate the relationship between
  stigma and treatment outcomes'
- 'Step 4: These cognitive and emotional barriers lead to treatment avoidance, early dropout, or reduced
  engagement'
- 'Step 5: Structural discrimination in healthcare settings compounds individual-level stigma effects
  on treatment retention'

description: This systematic review examines how perceived social stigma impacts substance use disorder
  treatment outcomes. Qualitative studies confirm stigma experiences are common and negatively impact
  treatment-related feelings and beliefs. Quantitative evidence suggests primarily indirect effects through
  negative emotions and cognitive mechanisms like self-efficacy, though one study found direct effects.
  The review notes significant inconsistency in definitions and measurement across studies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism traces to structural stigma embedded in social institutions, healthcare
    systems, and policy frameworks that criminalize and moralize substance use. The review appropriately
    focuses on how societal stigmatization creates barriers to treatment rather than blaming individuals
    for treatment failure. Equity implications include that marginalized groups may face compounded stigma
    (racial/ethnic minorities, people experiencing poverty, LGBTQ+ individuals) creating greater barriers
    to treatment access and success. Structural interventions should target reducing stigma in healthcare
    settings and public policy rather than expecting individuals to overcome stigma alone.
