mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Refutation texts explicitly state and acknowledge the misconception'
- 'Step 2: Text provides clear scientific explanation contradicting the misconception'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive conflict triggers active processing and conceptual change'
- 'Step 4: Corrected understanding replaces or suppresses misconception in memory'
- 'Step 5: Updated knowledge persists across both immediate and delayed assessments'

description: Refutation texts that directly address and correct scientific misconceptions show consistent
  and statistically significant advantages over non-refutation texts in reducing misconceptions. This
  meta-analysis of 76 studies with 294 effect sizes demonstrates that structured communication approaches
  can effectively counter misinformation, with implications for health communication about alcohol, tobacco,
  and other public health topics where misconceptions persist.

  description: 26 moderators were examined but none significantly enhanced or diminished the impact of
    refutation texts, suggesting robust effects across conditions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism is relevant to health equity because misinformation disproportionately
    affects communities with less access to quality health education and science literacy resources. Effective
    counter-messaging strategies can be deployed through public health communications, policy maker communications,
    and educational settings to address health misconceptions that may drive harmful behaviors. The finding
    that no moderators enhanced or diminished effects suggests these interventions may work equitably
    across populations, though equity-specific analyses were not reported in the abstract.
