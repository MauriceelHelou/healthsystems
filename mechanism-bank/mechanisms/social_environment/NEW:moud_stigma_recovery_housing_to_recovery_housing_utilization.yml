direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recovery housing staff and operators hold stigmatizing beliefs about MOUD as substituting one
  substance for another'
- 'Step 2: Stigma creates hesitancy among program operators to accept MOUD-prescribed individuals'
- 'Step 3: People prescribed MOUD face exclusion from recovery housing options'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to stable housing environment undermines recovery support infrastructure'
- 'Step 5: Decreased recovery housing utilization among MOUD-prescribed population'

description: MOUD-related stigma among recovery housing operators and staff creates barriers to housing
  access for people prescribed medications for opioid use disorder. This stigma manifests as hesitancy
  to accept MOUD-prescribed residents due to beliefs about medication misuse or diversion risk, ultimately
  reducing housing utilization among this population.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces housing exclusion to organizational and cultural stigma rather
    than individual deficits. The structural root cause is the abstinence-only ideology embedded in many
    recovery communities, which conflicts with evidence-based medication treatment. Addressing this requires
    organizational policy change, staff education, and culture shift rather than expecting individuals
    to overcome stigma alone. Equity implications include disproportionate housing barriers for those
    who benefit most from MOUD.
