category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High violent crime rates create chronic neighborhood stress and fear'
- 'Step 2: Parents keep children indoors to avoid violence exposure, reducing physical activity'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress activates inflammatory pathways that worsen asthma symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Reduced outdoor activity limits lung function development and overall respiratory health'
- 'Step 5: Increased asthma exacerbations due to combined stress-induced inflammation and reduced physical
  fitness'

description: Neighborhood violent crime creates chronic stress and limits children's outdoor activity,
  leading to increased asthma exacerbations through inflammatory pathways and reduced physical fitness.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects observed in high-crime areas of South Side Chicago with spatial clustering
    of violence
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural disinvestment in communities including inadequate
    funding for schools, mental health services, job programs, and community resources that prevent violence.
    High crime rates result from concentrated poverty and lack of economic opportunities, not individual
    moral failings. Violence concentrates in historically redlined neighborhoods due to systematic disinvestment.
