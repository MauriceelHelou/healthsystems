direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Justice involvement creates multiple stressors including legal uncertainty, employment barriers,
  and housing instability that promote alcohol use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 2: Community supervision requirements (meetings, reporting) conflict with treatment schedules
  and employment, limiting treatment access'
- 'Step 3: Stigma associated with justice involvement reduces help-seeking behavior and healthcare engagement'
- 'Step 4: Lack of targeted interventions for this population perpetuates hazardous alcohol use patterns'

description: Among justice-involved young adults, 51.9% reported hazardous alcohol use. The structural
  barriers created by justice system involvement contribute to low treatment engagement (only 21.4% in
  current treatment), perpetuating alcohol use disorders.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes that hazardous alcohol use among justice-involved young
    adults is not simply individual behavior but results from structural barriers to care created by the
    justice system itself. The finding that most are supervised in the community - not incarcerated -
    highlights how punitive community supervision creates treatment access barriers while maintaining
    exposure to substances.
