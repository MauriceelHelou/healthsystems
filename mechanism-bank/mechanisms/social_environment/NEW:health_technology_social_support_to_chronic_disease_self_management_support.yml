mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Formal caregivers (healthcare providers) and informal caregivers (family members) provide technology
  assistance'
- 'Step 2: Social support reduces anxiety and increases confidence in using health monitoring devices'
- 'Step 3: Caregiver involvement facilitates consistent use of wearables and mobile health applications'
- 'Step 4: Sustained technology use enables better chronic disease monitoring and self-management'

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how social infrastructure and caregiving systems structurally
    enable or constrain access to health technology benefits. Older adults without caregiver networks
    face structural disadvantages in technology adoption, reflecting broader inequities in social support
    systems.
