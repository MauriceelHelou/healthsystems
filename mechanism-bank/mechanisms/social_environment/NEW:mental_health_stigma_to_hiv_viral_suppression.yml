- 'Step 2: People living with HIV and co-occurring mental health conditions avoid or delay engaging with
  healthcare systems'
- 'Step 3: Reduced engagement leads to inconsistent antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence'
- 'Step 4: Poor medication adherence results in failure to achieve viral suppression'

  description: Co-occurring substance use compounds stigma effects and further impairs treatment engagement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies stigma as a structural barrier rather than blaming individuals
    for non-adherence. Stigma is perpetuated through healthcare systems, social institutions, and cultural
    norms that discriminate against people with mental health conditions. Interventions should target
    destigmatization at institutional and policy levels.
