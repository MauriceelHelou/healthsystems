- 'Step 1: Low educational attainment limits women''s economic opportunities, employment
  prospects, and income-generating potential'
- 'Step 2: Reduced economic independence creates financial dependency on intimate
  partners, limiting women''s ability to leave abusive relationships'
- 'Step 3: Lower education is associated with reduced decision-making power within
  relationships and households'
- 'Step 4: Limited education may reduce awareness of legal rights, available support
  services, and strategies for addressing violence'
- 'Step 5: Educational disparities between partners and economic dependency increase
  vulnerability to physical, sexual, and psychological intimate partner violence'

description: Lack of formal education is a significant determinant of intimate partner
  violence against women. Both meta-analyses consistently identify educational background
  as a key risk factor. Women with lower educational attainment experience higher
  rates of physical, sexual, and psychological violence from intimate partners. This
  relationship operates through multiple pathways including reduced economic independence,
  lower decision-making power in relationships, and limited awareness of rights and
  resources. The pooled prevalence of IPV among pregnant women in Ethiopia was 37%,
  with lack of formal education identified as a significant associated factor.
