- 'Step 1: Alcohol marketing through traditional and digital media increases exposure to alcohol-promoting
  content'
- 'Step 2: Digital marketing enables individualized and targeted advertising that circumvents traditional
  placement restrictions'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure normalizes alcohol consumption and creates positive associations with drinking'
- 'Step 4: Marketing exposure increases initiation of drinking, particularly among youth, and promotes
  heavier consumption patterns'
- 'Step 5: Sustained exposure and consumption patterns increase risk of developing alcohol use disorder'

description: This narrative review examines how alcohol marketing through digital media increases exposure
  to alcohol-promoting content, with comprehensive advertising bans being most effective at reducing exposure.
  Partial bans and placement restrictions have limited effectiveness as promotional budgets shift to less
  regulated media channels.

  variation_notes: Effects vary by international jurisdiction based on regulatory approaches applied to
    digital media; some jurisdictions have implemented comprehensive bans while others rely on partial

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately focuses on structural and policy-level factors (advertising
    regulation, digital media governance) rather than individual consumer choices. The paper emphasizes
    that current regulatory frameworks developed for traditional media are inadequate for digital contexts,
    representing a structural gap that disproportionately affects populations targeted by digital marketing.
    Equity implications include differential targeting of vulnerable populations through personalized
    digital advertising.
