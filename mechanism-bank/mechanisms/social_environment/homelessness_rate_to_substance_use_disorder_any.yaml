direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates extreme chronic stress through exposure to violence,
  lack of safety, uncertainty about basic needs (shelter, food), and social marginalization'
- 'Step 2: Individuals experiencing homelessness have limited access to healthy coping
  mechanisms, mental health services, and social support networks'
- 'Step 3: Substance use emerges as a coping mechanism for trauma, physical discomfort
  (cold, pain), mental health symptoms, and the daily hardships of street life'
- 'Step 4: The homeless environment facilitates substance access and normalized use
  through peer networks and lack of structured daily activities'
- 'Step 5: Once substance use begins, homelessness creates barriers to recovery including
  lack of stable housing required for treatment programs, no safe storage for medications,
  and continued exposure to substance-using environments'

description: Meta-analytic evidence from 39 studies demonstrates extremely high prevalence
  of substance use disorders among homeless populations in high-income countries.
  Alcohol use disorders affect 36.7% and drug use disorders affect 21.7% of homeless
  individuals, compared to general population rates of approximately 5-10%. The COVID-19
  pandemic exacerbated these disparities by disrupting access to treatment services
  and creating additional stressors for persons experiencing homelessness. The bidirectional
  relationship is acknowledged, but homelessness creates and sustains conditions that
  promote substance use initiation and progression while creating substantial barriers
  to recovery.
