structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Anxiety in PLWHA is a direct consequence of structural discrimination and inadequate
    public health education rather than individual psychological weakness. The mechanism demonstrates
    how social environments produce mental health outcomes. Structural interventions should focus on eliminating
    discriminatory practices and improving public understanding of HIV/AIDS.
