mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Web-based training standardizes RBS curriculum delivery, eliminating variation
  in instruction quality across different instructors and classes'
- 'Step 2: Standardized online training ensures consistent implementation of evidence-based
  protocols for recognizing and responding to patron intoxication'
- 'Step 3: Servers receive uniform messaging about legal responsibilities and techniques
  for refusing service to intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 4: Trained servers apply standardized protocols when encountering apparently
  intoxicated patrons, resulting in higher refusal rates'

  description: Refusal rates showed significant differences at immediate post-training
    (68% vs 49%) and 1-year follow-up (68% vs 58%), but not at 6-month follow-up (69%
    vs 64%), suggesting temporal variation in training effectiveness

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Younger pseudo-patrons were consistently refused service more often
    than older pseudo-patrons, indicating age-based differential application of refusal
    protocols
