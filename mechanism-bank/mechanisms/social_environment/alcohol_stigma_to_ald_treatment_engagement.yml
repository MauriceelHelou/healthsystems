description: Social and medical stigma surrounding alcohol use disorders creates barriers to treatment
  engagement and healthcare quality, contributing to worse ALD outcomes through delayed and inadequate
  care.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Stigma reflects broader social construction of addiction as moral failing rather
    than medical condition. This mechanism demonstrates how cultural attitudes embedded in healthcare
    systems create treatment disparities. Stigma particularly affects marginalized populations who face
    intersectional discrimination, compounding barriers to care.
