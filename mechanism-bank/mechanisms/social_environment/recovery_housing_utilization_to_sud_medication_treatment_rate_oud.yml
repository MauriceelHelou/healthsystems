    found intrusive or isolating
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural factors in recovery housing that either support
    or undermine MOUD treatment success. The tension between medical and social models of recovery represents
    a systems-level issue requiring organizational policy changes rather than individual behavior modification.
    Stigma toward MOUD recipients represents structural discrimination that creates barriers to treatment.
