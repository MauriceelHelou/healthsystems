description: No association was observed between HIV-related stigma and alcohol use disorders in the pooled
  meta-analysis. Despite theoretical pathways suggesting alcohol as a coping mechanism for stigma-related
  distress, the evidence did not support this association.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 9548
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Null finding may reflect heterogeneity across cultural contexts and varying alcohol
    use patterns globally
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The null finding is important for understanding that while stigma has clear mental
    health impacts, the relationship with alcohol use may be more complex and context-dependent. This
    challenges assumptions about simple stress-coping pathways and suggests structural determinants of
    alcohol use among PLWH may operate through different mechanisms.
