direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adolescent homelessness removes protective factors including stable family environment and
  adult supervision'
- 'Step 2: Street environments and unstable housing situations increase exposure to alcohol use and access'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress, trauma, and mental health symptoms associated with homelessness drive self-medication
  behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Lack of healthcare access prevents early intervention for problematic alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 5: Alcohol use disorder develops as coping mechanism becomes entrenched without treatment availability'

description: Alcohol abuse disorder affected 38% of homeless adolescents, representing the third most
  common disorder identified. This reflects how housing instability creates structural conditions that
  dramatically elevate alcohol use disorder risk in adolescent populations.

  description: Co-occurring mental health disorders increase vulnerability to alcohol use disorder among
    homeless adolescents
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: High alcohol use disorder prevalence among homeless youth reflects structural determinants
    including inadequate youth housing programs, insufficient mental health services, and lack of early
    intervention systems. The mechanism avoids individual blame by recognizing that housing instability
    creates environments conducive to alcohol misuse. Equity considerations include that youth of color
    and LGBTQ+ youth face higher homelessness rates and thus greater exposure to this risk pathway.
