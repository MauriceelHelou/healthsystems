description: PLWH diagnosed with depression were 1.61 times more likely to report HIV-related stigma.
  Depression emerges from the chronic psychological burden of experiencing structural discrimination and
  social marginalization.

  description: Higher social support levels protect against stigma reporting and may buffer depression
    development
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism emphasizes that depression among PLWH stems from structural stigma,
    discrimination by healthcare providers, and intersection with broader structural inequalities - not
    individual psychological weakness. The paper recommends interventions targeting mental health at structural
    level and practitioner-provided social support.
