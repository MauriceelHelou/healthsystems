mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with OUD receive reentry services that address social determinants
  of health (housing, employment, healthcare access) during and after incarceration'
- 'Step 2: SDOH-focused interventions reduce competing priorities and structural barriers
  that often derail recovery efforts post-release'
- 'Step 3: Stable housing, employment support, and healthcare navigation enable consistent
  engagement with medication-assisted treatment (MAT) and other recovery services'
- 'Step 4: Continued medication treatment throughout criminal justice involvement
  and post-release, combined with SDOH support, reduces opioid use and prevents return
  to substance use'
- 'Step 5: Addressing both clinical OUD treatment and social determinants creates
  synergistic effects that improve post-release opioid-related outcomes'

description: Reentry services that include social determinants of health support can
  reduce opioid use disorder outcomes post-release by addressing the structural and
  social barriers that compete with recovery efforts. The systematic review found
  that while medication-assisted treatment is effective, most interventions did not
  include SDOH components despite investigators recognizing these as critical competing
  priorities. The evidence suggests that comprehensive reentry services addressing
  both clinical OUD treatment and SDOH needs (housing, employment, healthcare access)
  would likely produce stronger reductions in post-release opioid use.
