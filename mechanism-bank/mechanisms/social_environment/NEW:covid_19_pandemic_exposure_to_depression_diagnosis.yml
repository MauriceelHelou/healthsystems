structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces pandemic-related depression to structural factors including
    economic disruption, inadequate social safety nets, and public health system strain rather than individual
    vulnerability. The high prevalence reflects systemic failures in mental health infrastructure and
    social protection in a low-middle income country context.
