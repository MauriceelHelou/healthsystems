mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Living alone reduces daily social contact and opportunities for emotional
  support, leading to perceived isolation'
- 'Step 2: Social isolation diminishes access to protective factors including emotional
  validation, practical assistance, and sense of belonging'
- 'Step 3: Reduced social support amplifies psychological distress, depression, and
  feelings of hopelessness'
- 'Step 4: Absence of close relationships removes natural barriers to suicidal ideation
  (no one to notice warning signs or intervene)'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative effect of isolation-related psychological burden increases vulnerability
  to suicidal thoughts'

description: Living alone is a significant risk factor for suicidal ideation across
  multiple populations including cancer patients and healthcare workers. Meta-analytic
  evidence from cancer patients and systematic review of healthcare workers during
  COVID-19 consistently identify living alone as independently associated with increased
  suicidal ideation. The mechanism operates through reduced social support, diminished
  protective interpersonal connections, and absence of monitoring or intervention
  from close others. This risk is compounded by co-occurring depression, anxiety,
  psychiatric history, and economic stressors.
