    pathway from ACEs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces homelessness to its structural roots in childhood adversity
    and social disadvantage, avoiding individual blame. The concentration of ACEs among homeless populations
    reflects intergenerational transmission of structural disadvantage. Equity implications include that
    children in poverty, in foster care, or in households affected by violence face higher ACE exposure
    and subsequent homelessness risk, creating racialized and class-based patterns of housing instability.
