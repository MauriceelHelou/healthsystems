  node_name: Alcohol Restrictive Cannabis Permissive Policy Pattern
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban areas with more low-income and racial/ethnic minority residents have experienced harms
  from historical alcohol outlet over-concentration'
- 'Step 2: Progressive political orientation favors cannabis legalization as drug policy reform and social
  justice issue'
- 'Step 3: Recognition of cannabis prohibition''s disproportionate impact on minority communities'
- 'Step 4: Local policies reflect both stricter alcohol control (addressing historical harms) and permissive
  cannabis approach (reform orientation)'
- 'Step 5: Results in alcohol-restrictive/cannabis-permissive policy pattern (12% of localities)'

description: Urban, politically progressive localities with higher proportions of low-income and racial/ethnic
  minority residents were more likely to adopt policies restrictive on alcohol but permissive on cannabis
  (12% of sample), potentially reflecting community responses to historical alcohol-related harms and
  progressive drug policy reform orientations.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how community demographics and political orientation
    shape substance policy approaches. The pattern may reflect efforts by marginalized communities to
    address historical inequities in alcohol outlet placement while embracing cannabis legalization as
    criminal justice reform. This represents community-level agency in policy formation, though the finding
    that lessons from alcohol regulation are not being applied to cannabis raises public health concerns.
