category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women experience intimate partner violence (physical, psychological, and/or
  sexual abuse) from a current or former partner'
- 'Step 2: IPV exposure triggers chronic stress responses, trauma, feelings of helplessness,
  and erosion of self-worth and social support'
- 'Step 3: Sustained psychological distress, social isolation, and trauma symptoms
  develop in response to ongoing or past violence'
- 'Step 4: These factors culminate in increased risk of major depressive disorder,
  with bidirectional reinforcement where depression may increase vulnerability to
  continued IPV'

description: Strong and consistent evidence from multiple meta-analyses demonstrates
  that intimate partner violence significantly increases the risk of depression among
  women. The pooled odds ratios range from 1.76 for recent IPV exposure to 2.04-3.14
  across different IPV types. The burden of proof analysis confirmed a moderate association
  with 63% increased risk of major depressive disorder. The relationship appears bidirectional,
  with depression also potentially increasing vulnerability to continued IPV. Evidence
  supports both immediate and long-term depressive consequences of IPV exposure.
