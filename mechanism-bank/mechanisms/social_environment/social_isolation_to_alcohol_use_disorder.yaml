mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social isolation creates psychological distress through loss of social
  support networks and meaningful interpersonal connections'
- 'Step 2: This psychological distress triggers maladaptive coping mechanisms, with
  alcohol use serving as a common stress response'
- 'Step 3: Isolated individuals lack social monitoring and accountability that normally
  moderate drinking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Continued excessive alcohol use in response to isolation-related stress
  leads to development or relapse of alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 5: For those previously abstinent, social isolation undermines recovery support
  systems, increasing relapse risk'

description: Social isolation increases risk of alcohol use disorder through multiple
  mechanisms including increased psychological stress, use of alcohol as a maladaptive
  coping strategy, reduced social support and monitoring, and disruption of treatment
  access. Evidence from COVID-19 pandemic studies demonstrates that social isolation
  during lockdowns was associated with increased alcohol consumption and relapse among
  individuals with AUD or in recovery. Approximately 30.8% of Australian participants
  reported drinking significantly more than normal during pandemic-related isolation,
  while London studies specifically identified social isolation as a risk factor for
  increased consumption and relapse.
