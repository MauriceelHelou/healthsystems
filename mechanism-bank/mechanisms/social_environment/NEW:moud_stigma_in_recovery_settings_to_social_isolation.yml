direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recovery homes lack formal policies to address MOUD-related stigma among staff'
- 'Step 2: Inconsistent staff attitudes toward MOUD create tension between medical and social models of
  recovery'
- 'Step 3: Some residents experience staff behavior as intrusive or judgmental regarding their MOUD use'
- 'Step 4: Stigmatizing treatment leads to marginalization and isolation of MOUD recipients within recovery
  community'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural gap in recovery home policies. The conflict
    between medical and social models of recovery creates systemic barriers for MOUD recipients. The solution
    requires organizational-level intervention (staff education, formal policies) rather than expecting
    individual residents to navigate stigma alone. This represents an equity issue as MOUD recipients
    face differential treatment within recovery communities.
