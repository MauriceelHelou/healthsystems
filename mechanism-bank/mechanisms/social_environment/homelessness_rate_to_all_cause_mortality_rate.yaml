mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness exposes individuals to extreme social exclusion, poverty,
  and marginalization that creates barriers to healthcare access and health-promoting
  resources'
- 'Step 2: Homeless individuals experience elevated rates of multiple morbidities
  including infectious diseases, mental health conditions, and injuries due to environmental
  exposures, violence, and lack of shelter'
- 'Step 3: Overlapping risk factors including substance use disorders, incarceration
  history, and engagement in survival sex work compound health vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated health burden from multimorbidity, delayed healthcare, and
  ongoing environmental stressors leads to substantially elevated all-cause mortality
  rates compared to general population'

description: Homelessness is associated with a standardized mortality ratio of 11.86,
  indicating nearly 12-fold increased mortality compared to the general population.
  This systematic review of 92 datapoints found that 99% showed significantly elevated
  all-cause mortality among homeless populations in high-income countries. The elevated
  mortality reflects extreme health inequities driven by social exclusion, multimorbidity,
  and barriers to healthcare.
