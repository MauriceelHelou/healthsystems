description: The review found loneliness is related to poor mental health among people with substance
  use problems. Cognitive theories have proposed cognitive patterns underlying the onset and maintenance
  of loneliness, though these had not been adequately investigated in interventions.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of effective loneliness interventions for people with substance use problems
    represents a structural gap in mental health services. The review notes cognitive theories exist but
    have not been translated into measurement or intervention efforts, indicating systemic research-to-practice
    gaps.
