description: Older age is associated with lower unmet primary care needs, possibly reflecting longer-established
  care relationships, reduced work-related barriers, and healthcare system factors that better serve older
  populations.

  description: Mobility limitations associated with aging may partially offset the protective effect of
    older age
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This age gradient in unmet needs highlights how healthcare system design may better
    serve certain populations. The finding raises equity concerns about younger working-age adults who
    may face more barriers related to employment, competing demands, and less established healthcare relationships.
