mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Professional networking opportunities are primarily structured around alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Non-participation in drinking creates visible differentiation within social groups'
- 'Step 3: Even when physically present, non-drinkers are not fully integrated into social bonding that
  occurs through shared drinking'
- 'Step 4: This produces feelings of exclusion and marginalization within professional peer groups'
- 'Step 5: Repeated experiences of social distance during networking events accumulate into broader workplace
  social isolation'

description: The study documents how Muslim women experience feelings of exclusion and marginalization
  within their professional groups despite attending alcohol-centered networking events. The practice
  of 'happy hours' creates a paradox where physical presence does not translate to social inclusion, as
  the act of drinking together serves as a bonding ritual that non-drinkers cannot fully participate in.
  This structural arrangement produces social isolation even among those who make efforts to attend.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism correctly identifies social isolation as a product of organizational
    structure rather than individual social skill deficits. The invisible nature of alcohol as an organizational
    norm (per Acker's framework) means that the isolating effects on religious minorities are not recognized
    as discrimination. This has equity implications for religious minority women's access to professional
    networks that facilitate career advancement, mentorship, and organizational belonging.
