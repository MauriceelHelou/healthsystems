structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism clearly identifies structural root causes of stigma in educational
    and public health infrastructure failures rather than individual prejudice. The pathway demonstrates
    how inadequate investment in health education creates conditions for discrimination. Policy interventions
    should target educational systems and public health messaging rather than individual attitude change.
