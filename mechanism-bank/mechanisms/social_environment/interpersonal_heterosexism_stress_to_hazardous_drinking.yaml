  target SGM individuals in daily interactions'
- 'Step 2: Repeated interpersonal oppression-based stressors accumulate and activate
  physiological and psychological stress responses'

- 'Step 4: Alcohol use escalates as a tension-reduction mechanism to manage interpersonal
  minority stress, progressing to hazardous drinking patterns'
