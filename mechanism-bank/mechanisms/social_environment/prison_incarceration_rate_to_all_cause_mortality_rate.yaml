direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Imprisonment exposes individuals to extreme social exclusion, marginalization,
  and concentrated health risks within correctional facilities'
- 'Step 2: During and after incarceration, individuals experience elevated rates of
  substance use disorders, mental health conditions, infectious diseases (HIV, Hepatitis
  C, tuberculosis), and chronic conditions'
- 'Step 3: Post-release period carries exceptionally high mortality risk due to disrupted
  healthcare access, social support loss, housing instability, and overdose vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative health burdens and barriers to reintegration result in substantially
  elevated standardized mortality ratios compared to general population'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 337 studies found that imprisoned
  individuals experience extreme health inequities, with all-cause standardized mortality
  ratios significantly increased in 99% of 92 extracted datapoints. The pooled SMR
  of 11.86 indicates imprisoned individuals have nearly 12 times the mortality risk
  compared to the general population, driven by concentrated exposure to poverty,
  marginalization, multimorbidity, substance use, infectious disease, and barriers
  to healthcare access.
