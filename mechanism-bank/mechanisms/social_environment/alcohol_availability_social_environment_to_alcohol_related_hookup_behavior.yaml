direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol is frequently present and normalized in social environments where
  adolescents and young adults congregate (parties, bars, social gatherings)'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption reduces inhibitions and impairs decision-making capacity
  regarding sexual behavior'
- 'Step 3: The social context creates expectations and norms around combining alcohol
  use with sexual encounters'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol availability and consumption in these settings directly
  facilitates uncommitted sexual encounters (hookups)'
