mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Immigrant status creates structural vulnerabilities including limited legal
  protections, fear of deportation, and unfamiliarity with systems'
- 'Step 2: These structural barriers reduce access to community resources, professional
  support services, and protective social networks'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to protective factors impedes development of trauma recovery
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Barriers to protective factors delay or prevent recovery from IPV-related
  psychological trauma'
