direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal stigma around substance use disorder extends to medication-based treatments'
- 'Step 2: Patients internalize stigma and perceive MAUD use as a sign of weakness or failure'
- 'Step 3: Fear of judgment from family, peers, and healthcare providers discourages treatment-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Stigma-related concerns lead patients to decline, discontinue, or hide MAUD use'
- 'Step 5: Overall MAUD uptake and retention remain low despite medication effectiveness'

description: Perceived stigma surrounding medications for alcohol use disorder represents a significant
  patient-level barrier to treatment utilization. Patients who internalize societal stigma about AUD and
  its treatments are less likely to initiate or continue MAUD, perpetuating low utilization rates despite
  evidence of medication effectiveness.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Stigma around MAUD reflects broader structural stigmatization of substance use
    disorders rooted in moral frameworks and criminalization rather than medical understanding. Healthcare
    systems, media, and policy environments shape and perpetuate this stigma. Reducing MAUD stigma requires
    structural interventions including provider training, public education campaigns, and policy changes
    that frame AUD as a treatable medical condition. Marginalized communities may face compounded stigma
    due to intersecting discrimination.
