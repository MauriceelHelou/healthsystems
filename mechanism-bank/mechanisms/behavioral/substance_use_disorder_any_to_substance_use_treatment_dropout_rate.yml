- 'Step 1: Pregnant women with SUD face multiple structural barriers to treatment retention including
  stigma and criminalization'
- 'Step 2: Treatment programs may lack pregnancy-specific accommodations and wraparound services'
- 'Step 3: Competing demands of pregnancy/postpartum period reduce capacity for sustained treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Fear of CPS involvement may paradoxically deter treatment entry or continuation'

description: The study background notes that pregnant women with substance use disorder often fail to
  complete treatment, highlighting this as a significant clinical problem. Treatment retention can be
  influenced by multiple factors including CPS involvement, suggesting complex structural and system-level
  determinants of treatment success.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism frames treatment failure not as individual deficit but as product
    of structural conditions facing pregnant women with SUD. The authors appropriately call for research
    on how fear of CPS involvement affects treatment enrollment, acknowledging the dual role of child
    welfare systems as both barrier and facilitator. This reflects structural competency by recognizing
    how criminalization and surveillance of pregnant women shapes healthcare seeking behavior.
