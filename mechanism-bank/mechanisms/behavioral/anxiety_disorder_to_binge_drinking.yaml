mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Anxiety disorders create chronic states of negative affect, heightened
  stress reactivity, and psychological distress'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with anxiety experience dysregulated stress response systems
  and seek relief from persistent anxious symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol is used as a self-medication strategy to reduce anxiety symptoms
  and negative affect states'
- 'Step 4: The acute anxiolytic effects of alcohol reinforce drinking behavior, leading
  to escalation from moderate use to binge drinking patterns'
- 'Step 5: Repeated binge drinking episodes become established as a maladaptive coping
  mechanism for managing anxiety symptoms'

description: Anxiety disorders contribute to binge drinking through a self-medication
  pathway, where individuals use alcohol to cope with negative affect and chronic
  stress states. The review highlights that anxiety and mood disorders, along with
  stress and trauma, facilitate escalation from alcohol use to binge and heavy drinking
  patterns. Central and peripheral biological mechanisms, including dysregulated stress
  response systems, may underlie this relationship, with evidence suggesting sex-specific
  pathways that are particularly pronounced in women.
