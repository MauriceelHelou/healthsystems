direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Trauma-focused therapy (e.g., prolonged exposure, cognitive processing
  therapy) directly addresses PTSD symptoms by processing traumatic memories, reducing
  avoidance behaviors, and modifying maladaptive cognitions about the trauma'
- 'Step 2: Pharmacotherapy targeting substance use disorders (e.g., naltrexone, acamprosate)
  reduces craving, blocks rewarding effects of substances, and stabilizes neurobiological
  systems disrupted by chronic substance use'
- 'Step 3: The synergistic combination addresses the bidirectional relationship between
  PTSD and SUD - as trauma symptoms decrease, the need for substance use as self-medication
  diminishes; as substance use decreases, cognitive and emotional processing of trauma
  becomes more effective'
- 'Step 4: Combined treatment leads to sustained improvements in both PTSD severity
  and alcohol/drug use severity, with effects maintained at 12-month follow-up'

description: Combining trauma-focused behavioral therapy with pharmacotherapy for
  substance use disorders produces the largest treatment effects for comorbid PTSD
  and SUD compared to treatment as usual. This meta-analysis of 36 trials (N=4,046)
  found large effect sizes for both PTSD severity (d=-0.92) and alcohol use severity
  (d=-1.10) at end of treatment, with improvements sustained at 12-month follow-up.
  The synergistic approach addresses both conditions simultaneously, breaking the
  cycle of trauma symptoms driving substance use and substance use impairing trauma
  processing.
