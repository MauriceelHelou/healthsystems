mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mixed training exercise combines aerobic and resistance training modalities,
  engaging multiple physiological systems simultaneously including cardiovascular,
  musculoskeletal, and neuromuscular systems'
- 'Step 2: The combined exercise approach at optimal dose (~970 METs-min/week) induces
  comprehensive physiological adaptations including improved cardiorespiratory fitness,
  muscular strength, endurance, and body composition'
- 'Step 3: These physical improvements translate to enhanced functional capacity,
  reduced fatigue, and improved ability to perform daily activities'
- 'Step 4: Psychological benefits emerge including improved mood, reduced anxiety
  and depression, enhanced self-efficacy and body image'
- 'Step 5: The synergistic combination of physical and psychological improvements
  results in significantly enhanced health-related quality of life, with mixed training
  demonstrating the strongest effect among exercise modalities'

description: 'Mixed training exercise, combining aerobic and resistance components,
  demonstrates the strongest positive effect on health-related quality of life among
  cancer survivors. At an optimal dose of approximately 970 METs-min/week, mixed training
  produces a large standardized effect (SMD: 0.883), outperforming single-modality
  exercise interventions. The combined approach addresses multiple dimensions of quality
  of life through comprehensive physical and psychological adaptations.'
