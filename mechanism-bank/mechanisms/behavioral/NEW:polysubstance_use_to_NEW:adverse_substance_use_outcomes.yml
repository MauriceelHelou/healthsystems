mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Polysubstance use involves synergistic effects of multiple substances increasing physiological
  burden'
- 'Step 2: Combined substance use elevates overdose risk and complicates withdrawal management'
- 'Step 3: Treatment for polysubstance use is more complex and has lower success rates'
- 'Step 4: Syndemic interaction with criminal justice involvement amplifies adverse outcomes'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The syndemic framework used in this paper explicitly recognizes that adverse outcomes
    result from intersecting social conditions rather than individual choices. The paper calls for attention
    to social determinants of health, acknowledging structural root causes. Limited research on interventions
    reflects structural neglect of this population.
