direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with poly-substance use disorders engage in concurrent use
  of multiple substances (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines, stimulants, alcohol), creating
  complex pharmacological interactions'
- 'Step 2: Combined substance effects potentiate respiratory depression, cardiovascular
  stress, and central nervous system toxicity beyond what single substances would
  cause'
- 'Step 3: Unpredictable drug interactions and tolerance variations across multiple
  substances increase risk of accidental overdose'
- 'Step 4: Poly-substance users experience significantly higher overdose mortality
  rates compared to those with single substance use disorders (33% vs 9% of deaths
  from overdose)'

description: Poly-substance use disorder substantially increases drug overdose mortality
  risk compared to single-substance use disorders. In a 19-year prospective cohort
  study, patients with poly-substance use disorders died from overdoses at nearly
  four times the rate of those with alcohol use disorder alone (33% vs 9% of deaths,
  p=0.002). The combined use of multiple substances creates dangerous pharmacological
  interactions and unpredictable toxicity profiles that elevate fatal overdose risk.
