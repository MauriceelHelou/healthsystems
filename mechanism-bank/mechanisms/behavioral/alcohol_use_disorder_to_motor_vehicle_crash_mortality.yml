direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption leads to elevated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels'
- 'Step 2: Higher BAC impairs cognitive function, reaction time, and motor coordination'
- 'Step 3: Impaired driving capacity increases crash risk with approximately exponential relationship
  to BAC level'
- 'Step 4: Higher severity crashes result in increased mortality outcomes'

description: Meta-analysis of 60 studies examining the association between blood alcohol concentration
  (BAC) and road safety outcomes found that alcohol impairment substantially increases crash risk, injury
  severity, and driver culpability. The dose-response relationship is approximately exponential, meaning
  risk accelerates dramatically at higher BAC levels.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The relationship between BAC and crash/injury outcomes is stronger in Nordic countries
    than in other countries, possibly because of the relatively low level of drunk driving in these countries
moderators:
- name: BAC level
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The effect of BAC on crash and injury risk is stronger at higher BAC levels; relationship
    is approximately exponential
- name: Outcome severity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Effects are stronger for more serious outcomes (severe injury/death vs minor crashes)
- name: Geographic region
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Nordic countries show stronger effects, possibly due to lower baseline drunk driving rates
    making impaired drivers more conspicuous
- name: Data source (hospital data)
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Studies based on hospital data find smaller effects on average
- name: Control group type
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Studies using non-crash-involved control groups find smaller effects on average
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While this mechanism involves individual behavior (drinking and driving), structural
    factors shape exposure: alcohol availability policies, public transportation access, land use patterns
    requiring vehicle dependency, enforcement policies, and cultural norms around drinking vary geographically.
    The finding that Nordic countries show stronger effects may reflect stricter alcohol policies and
    better public transit reducing baseline drunk driving rates. Equity implications include that communities
    with fewer transit options, higher alcohol outlet density, or less DUI enforcement may have higher
    population-level risk.'
