mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-existing depression creates vulnerability to stress-induced coping behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Pandemic disrupts mental health treatment access and social support systems'
- 'Step 3: Current depression symptoms compound with pandemic-related stressors'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol used as self-medication for depression and anxiety symptoms'
- 'Step 5: Among binge drinkers, this leads to increased alcohol consumption patterns'

description: Binge drinkers with a previous diagnosis of depression and current depression symptoms had
  1.77 times greater odds of increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic compared to those reporting
  no depression. This highlights the compounding effect of mental health conditions on alcohol use during
  periods of structural disruption.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates health inequity where those with pre-existing mental
    health vulnerabilities experience disproportionate impacts from structural disruptions. The pathway
    reflects inadequate mental health infrastructure that fails to maintain continuity of care during
    crises, forcing vulnerable individuals toward maladaptive coping. Rather than blaming individual choices,
    this highlights systemic failures in mental health support systems and the need for integrated behavioral
    health responses during public health emergencies. Equity implications are significant for populations
    with limited mental health access pre-pandemic.
