direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol demand intensity reflects elevated subjective value placed on alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Elevated demand creates stronger motivation to consume alcohol even during recovery attempts'
- 'Step 3: This heightened reinforcing value of alcohol predicts relapse to heavy drinking in subsequent
  time periods'
- 'Step 4: Heavy drinking episodes reinforce and further elevate alcohol demand through neuroadaptation'

description: This prospective longitudinal study demonstrates bidirectional associations between alcohol
  demand intensity (measured via alcohol purchase task - consumption when drinks are free) and drinking
  patterns during natural recovery attempts. Higher demand at Quarter 1 distinguished heavy drinkers from
  abstainers at Quarter 2, and heavy drinking at Quarter 2 predicted higher demand at Quarter 3, which
  then predicted heavy drinking at Quarter 4.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While this study focuses on individual-level behavioral economic indicators, the
    findings have structural implications: alcohol pricing policies that increase cost may reduce demand
    intensity; availability of alcohol (e.g., outlet density, pricing) shapes the environment in which
    demand translates to consumption. The ''natural recovery'' framing (without treatment) highlights
    how lack of access to treatment services may leave individuals more vulnerable to demand-driven relapse.
    Equity implications include differential access to recovery support services and treatment resources
    across communities.'
