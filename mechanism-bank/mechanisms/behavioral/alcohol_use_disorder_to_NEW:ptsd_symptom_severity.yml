- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disrupts natural recovery processes from trauma'

- 'Step 3: Withdrawal effects and alcohol-related consequences increase physiological arousal and stress'
- 'Step 4: PTSD symptoms are maintained or exacerbated in subsequent weeks'

description: Greater alcohol use is prospectively associated with greater future PTSD symptom severity
  during integrated treatment. This reciprocal relationship supports the mutual maintenance model where
  alcohol use perpetuates PTSD symptoms, creating a reinforcing cycle.

    alcohol use on PTSD symptoms
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The bidirectional relationship demonstrates how co-occurring conditions maintain
    each other when structural treatment barriers exist. Traditional sequential treatment models that
    require addressing substance use before trauma treatment may inadvertently perpetuate both conditions.
    Integrated treatment approaches that address both simultaneously represent a structural intervention
    that can break this cycle. Access to such integrated treatment is often limited by healthcare system
    fragmentation, insurance coverage gaps, and provider training deficits.
