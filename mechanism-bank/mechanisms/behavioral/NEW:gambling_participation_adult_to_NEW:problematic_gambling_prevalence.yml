description: The systematic review found 1.41% (95% CI 1.06-1.84) of adults globally meet criteria for
  problematic gambling. This represents a substantial public health burden given the association between
  gambling and multiple health harms identified in the paper.

  description: Men have higher gambling rates (49.1%) vs women (37.4%), suggesting potential gender differences
    in problematic gambling
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The paper explicitly frames problematic gambling as a public health issue requiring
    governmental regulation rather than individual-level interventions. The call for strict regulation
    acknowledges that industry practices and regulatory environments are key structural determinants of
    population-level harm.
