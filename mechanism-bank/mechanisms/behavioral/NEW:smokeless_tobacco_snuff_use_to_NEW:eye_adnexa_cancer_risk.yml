direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smokeless tobacco contains carcinogenic compounds including tobacco-specific nitrosamines'
- 'Step 2: Systemic absorption of carcinogens from oral/nasal mucosa enters bloodstream'
- 'Step 3: Carcinogenic exposure to ocular and periocular tissues through systemic circulation'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of malignant transformation in eye and adnexal structures'

description: Ever use of smokeless tobacco was associated with nearly two-fold increased risk of eye and
  adnexa cancer, representing a novel finding not previously established in the SLT-cancer literature.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights health risks concentrated in populations with cultural
    practices involving tobacco use. Lower educational attainment and limited access to health information
    may perpetuate high-risk behaviors. The structural context includes limited cancer prevention resources
    and screening availability in South Africa. Addressing this requires health system investments and
    culturally appropriate health education.
