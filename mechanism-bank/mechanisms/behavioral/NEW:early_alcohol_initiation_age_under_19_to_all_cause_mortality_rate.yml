direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Earlier age at first drink establishes longer duration of alcohol exposure across the lifespan'
- 'Step 2: Extended duration increases cumulative alcohol-related organ damage'
- 'Step 3: Earlier initiation is associated with development of hazardous drinking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Hazardous drinking patterns compound physiological damage leading to elevated mortality'

description: Among current drinkers, those who initiated alcohol before age 19 had 20% higher mortality
  risk compared to those who initiated at age 19 or older, demonstrating a dose-response relationship
  with timing of first alcohol exposure

  equity_implications: This finding reinforces the public health rationale for minimum legal drinking
    age laws. The mechanism operates through structural policy (age restrictions) rather than individual
    blame, as early initiation often reflects environmental availability and social context rather than
    individual choice. Policy interventions targeting alcohol availability to youth are the appropriate
    structural response.
