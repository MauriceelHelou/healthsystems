direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Time-restricted eating (TRE) limits the daily eating window to 4-8 hours, creating a prolonged
  fasting period'
- 'Step 2: Extended fasting periods enhance metabolic flexibility and shift energy utilization toward
  fat oxidation'
- 'Step 3: Circadian alignment of feeding patterns optimizes hormonal regulation including insulin sensitivity'
- 'Step 4: Reduced caloric intake often naturally accompanies restricted eating windows'
- 'Step 5: Sustained TRE intervention (≥8 weeks) leads to significant reductions in body weight and fat
  mass'

description: Time-restricted eating interventions with 4-8 hour feeding windows lead to significant reductions
  in body weight in adults with overweight and obesity. The meta-analysis of 23 studies with 1867 participants
  found that TRE is an effective approach for weight loss, with optimal effects observed using an 8-hour
  eating window with morning timing for at least 8 weeks.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While TRE is framed as an individual behavior change, structural factors shape
    feasibility: work schedules, food environment timing, shift work policies, and access to meal preparation
    facilities all influence ability to implement TRE. Populations with irregular work hours, food insecurity,
    or lack of kitchen access may face barriers to TRE adherence. Policy interventions supporting regular
    work schedules and workplace meal facilities could improve TRE accessibility across socioeconomic
    groups.'
