direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions deliver evidence-based therapeutic content (e.g.,
  cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing) targeting both depressive
  symptoms and problematic alcohol use simultaneously'
- 'Step 2: Users engage with structured modules addressing negative thought patterns,
  behavioral activation, and alcohol use reduction strategies through accessible digital
  platforms'
- 'Step 3: Integrated treatment approach addresses the bidirectional relationship
  between depression and alcohol use, reducing both conditions concurrently'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement with digital interventions leads to measurable reductions
  in depressive symptoms, with small but significant effects observed at 3-month follow-up'

description: Digital interventions targeting both depression and problematic alcohol
  use simultaneously produce small but significant reductions in depressive symptoms
  at 3-month follow-up among people with co-occurring conditions. The pooled effect
  size (Hedges' g = 0.34) indicates a small beneficial effect favoring digital interventions
  over comparators.

  description: Effects on depressive symptoms were significant at 3-month follow-up
    (g=0.34, p=0.02) but non-significant at 6-month follow-up (g=0.29, p=0.15), suggesting
    potential attenuation of effects over time
