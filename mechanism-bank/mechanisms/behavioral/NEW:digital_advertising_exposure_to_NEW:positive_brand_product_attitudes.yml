description: Meta-analysis found significant effects of digital advertising formats on young people's
  brand and product attitudes for unhealthy commodities. This is particularly relevant as digital platforms
  are less regulated than traditional broadcast media and allow more targeted advertising to youth.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Digital advertising represents an evolving structural challenge. Traditional advertising
    regulations (e.g., broadcast restrictions on alcohol/tobacco advertising) often do not extend to digital
    platforms. This creates a regulatory gap that the industry exploits to reach young people. Policy
    solutions require updating regulations to address digital marketing environments.
