direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Opioid use disorder involves compulsive opioid use despite harmful consequences,
  leading to repeated exposure to opioids with unpredictable potency and purity'
- 'Step 2: Chronic opioid use creates tolerance, requiring higher doses to achieve
  effects while simultaneously narrowing the margin between effective and lethal doses'
- 'Step 3: Periods of abstinence (incarceration, treatment dropout) reduce tolerance,
  increasing overdose risk upon relapse at previously tolerated doses'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring risk factors in OUD populations (injection drug use, HIV infection,
  polysubstance use) compound overdose vulnerability'
- 'Step 5: Resulting overdose-specific crude mortality rate of 7.0 per 1000 person-years
  among people with OUD'

description: Opioid use disorder directly increases risk of opioid overdose mortality
  through multiple behavioral and physiological pathways. Meta-analysis of 101 cohorts
  demonstrates an overdose-specific crude mortality rate of 7.0 per 1000 person-years
  among people with OUD. The relationship is strengthened by injection drug use, HIV
  co-infection, and residence in low/middle-income countries where treatment access
  may be limited.
