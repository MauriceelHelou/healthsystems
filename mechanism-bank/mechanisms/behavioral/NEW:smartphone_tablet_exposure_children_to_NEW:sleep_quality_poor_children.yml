mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children are exposed to smartphones and tablets across daily routines'
- 'Step 2: Blue light exposure suppresses melatonin secretion affecting sleep architecture'
- 'Step 3: Stimulating content increases sympathetic nervous system activation'
- 'Step 4: Sleep fragmentation and reduced deep sleep stages result in poorer sleep quality'

description: Children using smartphones and tablets were 1.53 times more likely to have worse sleep quality
  (OR = 1.53; 95%CI = 1.41-1.65). Sleep quality encompasses factors beyond duration including sleep efficiency,
  night wakings, and restorative value of sleep.

  description: Evening and bedtime use likely has stronger effects on sleep quality
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Sleep quality in children is affected by broader household and neighborhood conditions
    including housing stability, noise exposure, and parental work schedules. Technology use may be a
    marker of or interact with other structural determinants. Addressing sleep quality requires attention
    to both device policies and underlying social conditions affecting family routines.
