direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption characteristic of alcohol use disorder leads
  to repeated hepatotoxic exposure'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism in the liver produces acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen
  species, causing oxidative stress and hepatocyte damage'
- 'Step 3: Sustained liver injury triggers inflammatory responses and activation of
  hepatic stellate cells'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis develops as collagen deposition replaces functional
  liver tissue'
- 'Step 5: Continued alcohol exposure with genetic susceptibility factors (e.g., PNPLA3
  variants) accelerates progression to cirrhosis'

description: Alcohol use disorder significantly increases the risk of alcoholic liver
  cirrhosis through chronic hepatotoxic exposure. This meta-analysis of 11 studies
  (3,495 ALD patients including 2,087 with cirrhosis, and 5,038 controls) demonstrates
  that chronic alcohol consumption leads to progressive liver damage. The relationship
  is modified by genetic factors, particularly the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant, which
  substantially increases cirrhosis susceptibility in alcohol users.

    approximately 2-fold increased risk, suggesting an additive genetic model.
