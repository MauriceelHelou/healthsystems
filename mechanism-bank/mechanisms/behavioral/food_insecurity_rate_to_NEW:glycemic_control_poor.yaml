direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Food insecurity creates inability to consistently obtain nutritious food,
  forcing reliance on cheaper, energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods high in refined carbohydrates'
- 'Step 2: Inconsistent food availability disrupts regular eating patterns and meal
  timing, making diabetes self-management difficult'
- 'Step 3: Competition between food costs and medication costs may lead to medication
  non-adherence or rationing among those with diabetes'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress from food insecurity activates physiological stress responses
  that elevate blood glucose levels'
- 'Step 5: Combined dietary, behavioral, and physiological factors result in elevated
  HbA1c levels and poor glycemic control outcomes'

description: Food insecurity is consistently associated with worse glycemic control
  among individuals with diabetes compared to food secure individuals. The relationship
  operates through multiple pathways including dietary quality compromises, disrupted
  eating patterns, medication-food tradeoffs, and chronic stress. However, the exact
  mechanisms remain unclear as interventional studies that effectively reduced food
  insecurity showed variable outcomes on glycemic control, suggesting the relationship
  is complex and multifactorial.
