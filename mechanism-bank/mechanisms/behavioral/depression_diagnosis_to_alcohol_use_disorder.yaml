direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Major depression creates persistent negative mood states, anhedonia, and
  psychological distress that individuals may seek to alleviate'
- 'Step 2: Self-medication hypothesis - individuals with depression use alcohol to
  temporarily relieve depressive symptoms such as low mood, anxiety, and sleep disturbances'
- 'Step 3: Shared neuroimmune mechanisms involving inflammatory mediators (cytokines)
  create biological vulnerability, as both conditions involve systemic and CNS inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic alcohol use develops as a coping mechanism, with progressive tolerance
  requiring increased consumption to achieve the same mood-modifying effects'
- 'Step 5: The bidirectional immune-to-brain signaling pathways become dysregulated,
  reinforcing both depressive symptoms and alcohol dependence, leading to alcohol
  use disorder'

description: Major depression increases risk of alcohol use disorder through both
  behavioral self-medication pathways and shared neuroimmune mechanisms. Individuals
  with depression may use alcohol to cope with negative mood states, while underlying
  inflammatory processes common to both conditions create biological vulnerability.
  The bidirectional communication between immune system and brain function, involving
  cytokines and other neuroimmune mediators, contributes to the frequent comorbidity
  between these disorders.
