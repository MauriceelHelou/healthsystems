direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic disease self-management interventions provide patients with structured
  education, skills training, and support for managing their health conditions'
- 'Step 2: Through skill-building activities and guided practice, patients develop
  confidence in their ability to perform disease management tasks such as medication
  adherence, symptom monitoring, and lifestyle modifications'
- 'Step 3: Repeated successful experiences with self-management behaviors reinforce
  patients'' belief in their capabilities, leading to improved self-efficacy'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced self-efficacy enables patients to better adapt to disease-related
  challenges and maintain self-management behaviors over time'

description: Self-management interventions for chronic diseases significantly improve
  patients' self-efficacy compared to usual care. A meta-analysis of 34 studies involving
  7,603 patients demonstrated a moderate positive effect (SMD 0.405, 95% CI 0.19-0.62,
  p<0.001), indicating that structured self-management support helps patients build
  confidence in their ability to manage their health conditions.
