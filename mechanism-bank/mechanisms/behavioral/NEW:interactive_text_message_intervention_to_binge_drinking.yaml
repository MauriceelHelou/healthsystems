direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Weekly Thursday text messages query upcoming weekend drinking plans and
  prompt participants to commit to a drinking limit goal, activating prospective planning
  and goal-setting cognitive processes'
- 'Step 2: Sunday follow-up texts assess actual weekend drinking quantity, creating
  a self-monitoring feedback loop that increases awareness of drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Tailored feedback based on responses provides personalized information
  about discrepancies between goals and behavior, reinforcing motivation to reduce
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Regular engagement over 12 weeks establishes new behavioral patterns and
  drinking norms, leading to sustained reductions in binge drinking frequency and
  intensity'

description: A 12-week interactive text message intervention combining weekly drinking
  plan queries, goal commitment prompts, and tailored feedback significantly reduced
  binge drinking in young adults. At 9 months, participants in the intervention group
  showed 31% fewer binge drinking days (IRR 0.69), 48% lower odds of binge drinking
  prevalence (OR 0.52), fewer drinks per drinking day, and 58% lower odds of alcohol-related
  injury compared to controls. Self-monitoring alone (without feedback) was not effective.
