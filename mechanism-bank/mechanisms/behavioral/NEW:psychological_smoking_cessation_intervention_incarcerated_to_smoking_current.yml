direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incarcerated individuals receive psychological interventions (cognitive-behavioral therapy,
  motivational interviewing, or similar approaches) targeting smoking cessation'
- 'Step 2: Interventions address psychological dependence, coping mechanisms, and motivation to quit within
  the correctional setting'
- 'Step 3: Participants develop skills and motivation to abstain from smoking'
- 'Step 4: Smoking abstinence rates increase compared to control conditions'

description: Psychological interventions for smoking cessation among incarcerated populations show initial
  promise with a significant increase in abstinence compared to controls (OR=3.41). However, high heterogeneity
  (I²=85.4%) and the effect becoming non-significant after publication bias adjustment suggest cautious
  interpretation. The pooled post-intervention abstinence rate was 18.8%.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism addresses a critical health equity issue: smoking prevalence is
    disproportionately high in correctional settings, reflecting structural inequities in health access
    and health education for incarcerated populations. The intervention targets a captive population with
    limited access to community-based cessation resources. The structural context of incarceration itself
    creates unique challenges and opportunities for behavioral health interventions. However, methodological
    weaknesses and small sample sizes in existing research reflect underinvestment in health services
    research for incarcerated populations.'
