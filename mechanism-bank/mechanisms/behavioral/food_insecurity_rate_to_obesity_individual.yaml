direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Food insecurity creates economic constraints that limit access to healthy,
  nutrient-dense foods, which tend to be more expensive than calorie-dense, processed
  alternatives'
- 'Step 2: Individuals experiencing food insecurity engage in compensatory eating
  behaviors, including overconsumption during periods of food availability (feast-famine
  cycles) and preference for high-calorie, shelf-stable foods'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from food insecurity triggers physiological responses including
  elevated cortisol, which promotes fat storage and increases appetite for energy-dense
  comfort foods'
- 'Step 4: These behavioral and physiological adaptations lead to energy imbalance
  and weight gain, particularly manifesting as overweight/obesity in adults, especially
  women'

description: Food insecurity is associated with greater prevalence of overweight/obesity
  in adults, with the association being especially strong for women. This comprehensive
  review of 50 studies (35 adult studies and 15 child studies) published between 2017-2020
  found robust evidence for this relationship in adults, while findings in children
  were more nuanced and often did not show significant associations, potentially because
  metabolic conditions had not yet developed.
