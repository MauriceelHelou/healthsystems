direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High intake of saturated fats and refined sugars causes rapid blood glucose
  fluctuations, leading to nighttime hypoglycemia and sleep disruption'
- 'Step 2: Processed foods trigger inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress that
  interfere with sleep-regulating neurobiological systems'
- 'Step 3: High-fat diets alter gut microbiome composition, affecting production of
  sleep-related neurotransmitters through the gut-brain axis'
- 'Step 4: Poor nutritional quality leads to deficiencies in sleep-promoting micronutrients,
  impairing melatonin synthesis and circadian regulation'
