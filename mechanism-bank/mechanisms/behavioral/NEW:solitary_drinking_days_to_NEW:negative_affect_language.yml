direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Within-person variation shows drinking alone days differ qualitatively from social drinking
  days'
- 'Step 2: On drinking alone days, individuals use nervous and annoyed language'
- 'Step 3: This negative affect on solitary drinking days indicates drinking alone may be response to
  distress'
- 'Step 4: Lower reported subjective well-being on these days suggests solitary drinking fails to improve
  mood'

description: Within-person analysis shows that on days when individuals drink alone, they express nervous
  and annoyed language and report lower subjective well-being. This day-level pattern suggests solitary
  drinking occasions are qualitatively different from social drinking and are associated with negative
  emotional states.

  description: Language-based subjective well-being measures predicted alcohol behavior more accurately
    than traditional rating scales, both between and within individuals
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The within-person design helps identify that solitary drinking days represent a
    departure from an individual's typical emotional state, suggesting environmental and contextual triggers
    rather than stable individual traits. This supports structural interventions that modify drinking
    contexts rather than treating problematic drinking as purely individual pathology.
