category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Episodic heavy drinking (binge drinking) causes acute spikes in blood pressure
  through sympathetic nervous system activation and vasoconstriction'
- 'Step 2: Repeated binge drinking episodes lead to sustained elevations in systolic
  blood pressure over time'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to elevated systolic blood pressure accelerates vascular
  changes and atherosclerosis'
- 'Step 4: Persistent elevation of blood pressure eventually meets clinical thresholds
  for hypertension diagnosis'

description: Binge drinking (consuming 5+ drinks for men or 4+ drinks for women in
  a single day) is associated with elevated systolic blood pressure, particularly
  in men. This commentary synthesizes evidence from multiple studies showing that
  no level of alcohol intake is associated with lower hypertension risk, and that
  episodic heavy drinking patterns contribute to elevated blood pressure. The relationship
  appears stronger in men than women, and drinking habits established in early adulthood
  have lasting impacts on cardiovascular health across the life course.

  description: Drinking habits adopted in early adulthood and middle age correlate
    with premorbid cardiovascular health indicators. Cumulative exposure to elevated
    blood pressure increases coronary heart disease risk proportionally.
