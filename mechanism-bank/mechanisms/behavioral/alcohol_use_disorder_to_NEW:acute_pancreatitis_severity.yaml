mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to metabolic changes in pancreatic acinar
  cells, including oxidative stress and accumulation of toxic metabolites such as
  acetaldehyde and fatty acid ethyl esters'
- 'Step 2: These metabolic changes sensitize the pancreas to acute injury, resulting
  in more severe inflammatory responses when acute pancreatitis is triggered'
- 'Step 3: Alcoholic acute pancreatitis (AAP) demonstrates higher rates of pancreatic
  necrosis compared to biliary acute pancreatitis, indicating more severe tissue damage'
- 'Step 4: The severity profile of AAP shows elevated risk for non-mild (moderately
  severe and severe) presentations compared to other etiologies like biliary or post-ERCP
  pancreatitis'

description: Alcohol use disorder is associated with increased severity of acute pancreatitis.
  This meta-analysis of 127 studies found that alcoholic acute pancreatitis (AAP)
  has a higher risk for non-mild (moderately severe and severe) conditions compared
  to biliary and post-ERCP pancreatitis. Specifically, pancreatic necrosis occurred
  more frequently in AAP than BAP patients (OR=1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.30). AAP also demonstrates
  significantly higher recurrence rates, which may contribute to cumulative pancreatic
  damage and increased severity over time.
