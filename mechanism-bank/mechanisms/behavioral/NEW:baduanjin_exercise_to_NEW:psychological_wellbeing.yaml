direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Baduanjin exercise combines slow, gentle physical movements with mindful
  breathing and mental focus, activating parasympathetic nervous system responses'
- 'Step 2: Regular practice reduces physiological stress markers and promotes relaxation
  through mind-body integration'
- 'Step 3: The meditative aspects of the practice help regulate emotional responses,
  reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety'
- 'Step 4: Improved glycemic control (FBG, HbA1c, 2-hPBG) reduces diabetes-related
  distress and emotional burden'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced mental health and reduced psychological symptoms contribute to
  overall improved psychological well-being'

description: Baduanjin, a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise, significantly improves
  psychological well-being in patients with type 2 diabetes. This meta-analysis of
  27 RCTs demonstrated large positive effects on overall psychological well-being
  (SMD=0.96), depression (SMD=1.03), anxiety (SMD=0.88), and mental health (SMD=0.72).
  The practice integrates physical movement, breathing techniques, and mental focus,
  addressing both physical and psychological aspects of diabetes management. Improvements
  in glycemic control may also contribute to enhanced psychological outcomes by reducing
  disease-related distress.
