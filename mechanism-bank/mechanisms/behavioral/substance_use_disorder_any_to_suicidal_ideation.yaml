direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorder creates neurobiological changes that affect mood
  regulation, impulse control, and cognitive functioning'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with SUD experience psychosocial consequences including relationship
  problems, employment difficulties, and social isolation that compound psychological
  distress'
- 'Step 3: The combination of neurobiological vulnerability and psychosocial stressors
  increases risk of developing suicidal thoughts, with 5-10 times higher lifetime
  suicide risk than general population'
- 'Step 4: Up to 19% of patients continue to experience suicidal ideation even after
  accessing treatment, indicating persistent vulnerability'

description: Substance use disorder substantially increases risk of suicidal ideation
  through both neurobiological and psychosocial pathways. The lifetime risk of suicide
  in patients with SUD is 5-10 times higher than the general population. Critically,
  up to 19% of patients continue to experience suicidal thoughts even after accessing
  treatment, indicating that the relationship persists across the treatment trajectory.
