direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep disturbances (including inadequate sleep duration, insomnia, poor
  sleep quality) disrupt neurobiological processes essential for emotional regulation
  and cognitive functioning'
- 'Step 2: Chronic sleep deprivation impairs prefrontal cortex functioning, reducing
  impulse control and increasing emotional reactivity to stressors'
- 'Step 3: Sleep disturbances amplify negative affect, hopelessness, and cognitive
  distortions while reducing problem-solving capacity'
- 'Step 4: Accumulating psychological distress and impaired coping mechanisms increase
  vulnerability to suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 5: Reduced inhibitory control combined with heightened emotional dysregulation
  increases likelihood of progression from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt'

description: This meta-analysis of 19 studies with over 1.1 million adolescents demonstrates
  that sleep disturbances significantly increase the risk of suicide attempts (OR=3.10)
  in adolescents without pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses. The threefold increased
  risk highlights sleep disturbances as an independent and modifiable risk factor
  for suicidal behavior in young populations.
