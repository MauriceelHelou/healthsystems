mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social media alcohol advertisements feature models appearing younger than 25 years old'
- 'Step 2: Underage viewers experience enhanced affective arousal when viewing relatable, peer-like models
  based on Limited Capacity Model of Mediated Motivated Message Processing (LC4MP)'
- 'Step 3: Psychophysiological responses indicate increased emotional engagement with younger-model advertisements'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced affective processing leads to stronger encoding and memory of alcohol brand messaging'

description: Alcohol advertisements featuring younger-looking models elicit stronger affective (emotional)
  processing responses in underage youth, as measured through psychophysiological recordings, compared
  to advertisements with older-appearing models.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism demonstrates how commercial entities exploit developmental vulnerabilities
    in youth through strategic marketing decisions. The psychophysiological pathway shows this is not
    simply about youth 'choosing' to be influenced - there are automatic, below-conscious-awareness processing
    differences that the alcohol industry exploits. This represents a commercial determinant of health
    requiring structural/regulatory intervention.
