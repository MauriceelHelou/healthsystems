- 'Step 1: Summer holiday programs increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior'
- 'Step 2: Increased energy expenditure from structured activities during program participation'
- 'Step 3: Prevention of accelerated weight gain that typically occurs during summer months when children
  are out of school'
- 'Step 4: Maintenance of healthier body composition through sustained physical activity and structured
  routines'

description: Summer holiday programs demonstrate a significant small effect on improving adiposity measures
  in school-aged children (g=-0.25). Programs help maintain healthy body weight during summer months when
  children typically experience accelerated weight gain due to reduced structure and physical activity.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the 'summer slide' in health that disproportionately affects
    children from disadvantaged backgrounds who may lack access to structured activities, safe outdoor
    spaces, and nutritious meals during summer vacation. Summer programs represent a structural intervention
    that can reduce health disparities by providing equal access to health-promoting environments regardless
    of family resources.
