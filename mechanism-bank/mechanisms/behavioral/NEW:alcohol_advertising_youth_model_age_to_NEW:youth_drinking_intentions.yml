  node_id: NEW:youth_drinking_intentions
  node_name: Youth Drinking Intentions
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol brands use younger-looking models (appearing under 25) in social media advertisements
  despite industry self-regulatory guidelines'
- 'Step 2: Underage minors viewing these ads experience increased identification and relatability with
  younger-appearing models through social cognitive processes'
- 'Step 3: Social cognitive theory suggests youth model their behavior on perceived peers and aspirational
  figures who appear similar in age'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced affective and cognitive processing of ads featuring younger models leads to more favorable
  attitudes toward alcohol'
- 'Step 5: Increased positive attitudes and identification translate to elevated behavioral intentions
  to consume alcohol'

  models, despite industry self-regulatory guidelines prohibiting use of models under 25.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights a structural failure in alcohol industry self-regulation.
    Despite guidelines prohibiting young-appearing models, brands circumvent these rules, creating an
    obesogenic media environment that targets vulnerable youth populations. The regulatory and policy
    implications are central - the study explicitly discusses advertising's role in hindering consumer
    well-being and calls for stronger regulatory interventions. This is a structural/commercial determinants
    of health issue rather than individual choice.
