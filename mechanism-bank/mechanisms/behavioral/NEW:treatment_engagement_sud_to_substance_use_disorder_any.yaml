direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Treatment engagement interventions (e.g., Assertive Community Treatment)
  increase contact frequency and continuity of care for patients with substance use
  disorder'
- 'Step 2: Sustained engagement enables delivery of evidence-based SUD treatments
  including counseling, medication-assisted treatment, and psychosocial support'
- 'Step 3: Consistent therapeutic contact addresses barriers to care access and maintains
  treatment adherence over time'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to treatment interventions leads to behavioral changes
  and coping skill development'
- 'Step 5: Substance use reduces, though effects vary across populations and treatment
  fidelity levels'

description: This systematic review of 5 randomized controlled trial datasets found
  mixed evidence that treatment engagement interventions reduce substance use. While
  ACT consistently improved treatment engagement (4 of 5 datasets showed higher engagement),
  substance use reduced in only half of the datasets, with only one showing significant
  reduction in the ACT group compared to controls. The relationship between engagement
  and substance use outcomes appears to be moderated by treatment fidelity and patient
  characteristics.
