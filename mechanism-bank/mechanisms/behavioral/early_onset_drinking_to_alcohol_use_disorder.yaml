mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early alcohol exposure during critical neurodevelopmental periods (before
  age 15) disrupts normal brain maturation and increases neurobiological vulnerability'
- 'Step 2: Early onset creates accelerated progression patterns, with adolescents
  showing peak risk for rapid transition from first drink to dependence symptoms'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes and accelerated progression patterns result
  in significantly higher rates of alcohol use disorder in late adolescence and adulthood'

description: Early onset drinking before age 15 significantly increases risk of developing
  alcohol use disorder through disruption of critical neurodevelopmental processes
  and acceleration of progression from initial use to dependence. Multiple longitudinal
  studies demonstrate that adolescents who begin drinking before age 15 show 36-77%
  higher rates of AUD compared to those with later onset, with particularly pronounced
  effects during the peak vulnerability period of adolescence.
structural_competency_notes: Early drinking onset is influenced by structural factors
  including family alcohol provision, peer networks, socioeconomic status, and school
  environments that may facilitate or constrain access to alcohol during critical
  developmental periods.
