direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women experience PTSD, often from distinct trauma types including interpersonal violence and
  sexual assault'
- 'Step 2: PTSD symptoms lead to psychological distress and attempts at self-medication'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol is used to manage PTSD symptoms, leading to problematic use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Development of alcohol use disorder, though with lower relative risk compared to men'

description: 'Among women, PTSD predicted a 4.14-fold increased risk of developing AUD (HR=4.14, 95% CI:
  3.99-4.30), demonstrating strong support for the self-medication model in women. While the effect was
  slightly lower than in men, it remains clinically and statistically significant.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Women's pathways from PTSD to AUD often involve distinct structural factors including
    gender-based violence, workplace harassment, and domestic violence - all of which have structural
    determinants in gender inequality, inadequate legal protections, and economic dependence. Access to
    trauma-informed care and substance use treatment may also differ by gender due to caregiving responsibilities,
    stigma, and healthcare system design.
