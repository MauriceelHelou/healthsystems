mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Older adults with alcohol use disorder have established patterns of substance use'
- 'Step 2: Polysubstance use patterns and substance-seeking behaviors transfer across substance types'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with AUD may initiate or reinitiate marijuana use as complementary or alternative
  substance'
- 'Step 4: Shared vulnerability factors and neurobiological pathways increase likelihood of marijuana
  initiation/reinitiation'

description: Alcohol use disorder was associated with a higher likelihood of marijuana initiation/reinitiation
  among older adults aged 50+, indicating that existing alcohol-related problems are a risk factor for
  beginning or resuming marijuana use.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism involves individual-level substance use patterns, it reflects
    broader structural issues including inadequate treatment access for AUD, social determinants driving
    substance use, and lack of integrated care for older adults with co-occurring conditions. The finding
    highlights the need for comprehensive substance use screening and treatment in older adult populations.
