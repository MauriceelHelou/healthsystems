direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Health warning labels are placed on food and alcohol products at point of selection'
- 'Step 2: Visual and textual warnings communicate health risks to consumers at decision-making moment'
- 'Step 3: Risk information activates cognitive processing of potential health consequences'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness of harms shifts product preferences away from labeled items'
- 'Step 5: Consumers are 26% less likely to select products displaying health warning labels'

description: Health warning labels placed on food and alcohol products reduce consumer selection of those
  products. Meta-analysis of 12 comparisons from 9 studies found participants were 26% less likely to
  choose a product displaying a health warning label compared to no-label controls.

  description: Image-and-text HWLs showed larger effect (RR=0.65, 95% CI 0.54-0.80) compared to text-only
    HWLs (RR=0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.85), though difference was not statistically significant
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural/policy intervention that modifies the choice
    environment rather than relying on individual willpower or education alone. Warning labels function
    as an upstream policy tool that can be mandated through regulation, similar to tobacco control policies.
    The intervention operates at the population level by changing the informational environment at point
    of purchase, potentially reducing inequities by providing standardized health information regardless
    of individual health literacy or access to health education. However, current evidence is limited
    to experimental settings and may not fully capture real-world effectiveness or differential impacts
    across socioeconomic groups.
