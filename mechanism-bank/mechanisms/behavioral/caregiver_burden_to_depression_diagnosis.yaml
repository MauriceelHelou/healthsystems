direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Informal caregiving creates chronic stress through demanding physical and
  emotional care responsibilities, often with limited respite or support'
- 'Step 2: Caregivers experience behavioral changes including reduced time for self-care,
  social isolation, disrupted sleep patterns, and decreased physical activity'
- 'Step 3: The combination of chronic stress, social withdrawal, and neglected personal
  health needs leads to psychological distress and emotional exhaustion'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged exposure to caregiving demands without adequate coping resources
  results in clinical depression, with prevalence ranging from 4% to 51% among informal
  caregivers'

description: Systematic review of 22 observational studies found that informal caregiving
  is consistently associated with higher occurrence of depression compared to non-caregivers.
  Longitudinal evidence from German health insurance data showed statistically significant
  increased incidence of depression among caregivers. Cross-sectional studies confirmed
  elevated depression prevalence (4-51%) in caregiver populations. The wide range
  in prevalence reflects heterogeneity in caregiving contexts, care recipient conditions,
  and available support systems.
