direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experiencing pain interference may reduce alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Pain-related disability may limit social situations where drinking typically occurs'
- 'Step 3: Medication interactions or health concerns associated with pain conditions may prompt reduced
  drinking'
- 'Step 4: This protective reduction occurs regardless of gender or AUD symptomatology'

description: Higher baseline pain interference was significantly associated with lower subsequent alcohol
  consumption at 3-year follow-up. Unlike the consumption-to-pain relationship, no moderating effects
  of gender or AUD symptomatology were observed for this direction of the association.

  equity_implications: This finding suggests that pain-related disability may serve as a natural limiting
    factor on alcohol consumption. However, structural factors influencing pain management access (healthcare
    coverage, pain treatment availability, opioid prescribing policies) may shape whether individuals
    reduce alcohol or seek alternative pain management strategies including problematic substance use.
