direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Methamphetamine use disorder involves chronic stimulant exposure that depletes
  monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems, particularly dopamine and serotonin'
- 'Step 2: Repeated methamphetamine use causes neurotoxic damage to dopaminergic and
  serotonergic neurons, leading to persistent neurochemical imbalances'
- 'Step 3: The resulting anhedonia, dysphoria, and emotional dysregulation during
  withdrawal and abstinence periods contribute to depressive symptomatology'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral consequences of methamphetamine use disorder (social isolation,
  relationship disruption, employment loss, legal problems) compound psychological
  distress and increase depression risk'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies demonstrates that methamphetamine
  use disorder is significantly associated with depression. The association is strongest
  for those meeting criteria for methamphetamine use disorder (OR=2.80) compared to
  any use. E-values analysis indicated low to moderate risk of unmeasured confounding
  in longitudinal results, supporting a likely causal relationship.
