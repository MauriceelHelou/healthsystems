description: Substance use disorders compound inherent human limitations in transferring skills learned
  in virtual reality environments to actual real-world contexts, reducing the sustained real-life benefits
  of virtual reality-based interventions for this population.

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural barrier in healthcare technology design.
    The challenge of skills transfer is framed as a universal human limitation that is exacerbated by
    SUD, not as individual failure. This has equity implications for how digital health interventions
    are designed and evaluated - populations with cognitive challenges from SUD may require modified intervention
    designs to achieve comparable benefits.
