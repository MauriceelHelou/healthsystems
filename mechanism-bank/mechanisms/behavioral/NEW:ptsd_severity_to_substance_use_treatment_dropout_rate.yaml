direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher PTSD severity increases emotional dysregulation and distress intolerance,
  making engagement with treatment protocols more challenging'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with severe PTSD symptoms may use substances as a coping mechanism,
  creating psychological barriers to treatment adherence'
- 'Step 3: Trauma-related avoidance symptoms characteristic of PTSD lead to avoidance
  of treatment settings and therapeutic processes that may trigger distress'
- 'Step 4: The combination of PTSD symptom burden and treatment demands results in
  higher dropout rates from substance use treatment programs'

description: A systematic review of 27 studies found relatively high levels of dropout
  across studies examining comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder treatment. The
  review notes that many patients do not fully engage with treatment, particularly
  in the context of comorbid PTSD. PTSD severity contributes to treatment dropout
  through multiple mechanisms including avoidance symptoms, emotional dysregulation,
  and the use of substances as a coping mechanism for trauma-related distress.
