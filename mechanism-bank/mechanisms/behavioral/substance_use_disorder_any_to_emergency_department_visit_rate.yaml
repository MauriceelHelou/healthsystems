direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorder leads to acute intoxication episodes, overdoses,
  and substance poisoning requiring emergency medical intervention'
- 'Step 2: Chronic substance use causes medical complications (infections, organ damage,
  withdrawal symptoms) that manifest as emergencies'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with substance use disorders often lack regular primary care
  access, leading to reliance on ED as primary healthcare source'
- 'Step 4: Substance-related injuries (accidents, violence, falls) result in ED visits
  for trauma care'
- 'Step 5: Repeated cycles of use, complications, and acute presentations drive elevated
  ED utilization rates'

description: 'Substance use disorder drives elevated emergency department utilization
  through multiple pathways: acute intoxication and overdose requiring emergency intervention,
  substance poisoning, chronic health complications from ongoing use, withdrawal syndromes,
  and substance-related injuries. Up to one-third of ED visits among vulnerable populations
  are alcohol-related, and up to one-quarter involve substance poisoning. This systematic
  review of 36 studies demonstrates that substance use is a dominant driver of ED
  presentations, particularly among marginalized populations who lack alternative
  healthcare access.'
