direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Informal caregivers take on significant responsibilities for care recipients,
  including physical care, emotional support, and care coordination'
- 'Step 2: These caregiving demands create chronic stress through unpredictable care
  needs, sleep disruption, reduced personal time, and financial strain'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to caregiving-related stressors activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system'
- 'Step 4: Sustained physiological stress response, combined with social isolation
  and reduced self-care behaviors, increases vulnerability to anxiety symptoms'
- 'Step 5: Persistent worry about care recipient outcomes, anticipatory grief, and
  uncertainty about the future contribute to development of anxiety disorders'

description: Informal caregiving is associated with higher occurrence of anxiety compared
  to non-caregivers. Cross-sectional evaluations in this systematic review found anxiety
  prevalence ranging from 2% to 38% among informal caregivers. The relationship operates
  through chronic stress exposure from caregiving demands, which manifests through
  behavioral pathways including disrupted sleep, reduced self-care, social isolation,
  and persistent worry about care recipient outcomes.
