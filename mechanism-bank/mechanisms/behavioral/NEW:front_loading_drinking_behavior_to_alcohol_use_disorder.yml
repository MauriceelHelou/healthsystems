mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Front-loading involves rapid consumption of alcohol within the first 5 minutes of access'
- 'Step 2: Rapid consumption leads to higher total intake within drinking sessions'
- 'Step 3: Repeated patterns of rapid, high-volume consumption may alter neural reward circuits'
- 'Step 4: Altered drinking dynamics may increase vulnerability to developing alcohol use disorder'

description: Front-loading drinking behavior (rapid consumption in initial minutes of access) is identified
  as the primary driver of sex differences in alcohol consumption. The authors suggest this drinking pattern
  may be relevant to understanding differential health vulnerabilities related to alcohol between sexes.

  description: Females show higher baseline front-loading behavior which primarily drives higher alcohol
    consumption in females compared to males
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights that drinking dynamics, not just total consumption, are
    important for understanding alcohol-related health outcomes. Sex differences in front-loading behavior
    may contribute to differential vulnerability to alcohol-related harms in women versus men. Environmental
    and policy factors that promote rapid drinking (like happy hour incentives) may disproportionately
    affect populations already prone to front-loading behavior. This has equity implications for understanding
    how promotional practices may create differential harm across sex and potentially other demographic
    groups.
