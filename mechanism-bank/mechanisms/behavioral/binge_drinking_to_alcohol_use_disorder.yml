direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher levels of alcohol consumption lead to neuroadaptive changes in the brain''s reward and
  stress systems'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure causes tolerance development requiring increased consumption for same effect'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological changes in dopamine and GABA systems create physical and psychological dependence'
- 'Step 4: Progressive loss of control over drinking behavior leads to clinical alcohol use disorder diagnosis'

description: Higher levels of alcohol consumption exponentially increase the risk of developing alcohol
  use disorder. At an average consumption of four standard drinks (40g pure alcohol) per day, the risk
  of developing AUD was increased sevenfold compared with current non-drinkers. Even moderate consumption
  of 20g/day (about one large beer) nearly triples the risk.

  description: Risk relationship is exponential - at 4 standard drinks/day (40g alcohol) risk is 7-fold
    compared to non-drinkers; at 20g/day risk is nearly 3-fold
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While framed as individual consumption, alcohol availability is shaped by structural
    factors including alcohol outlet density, pricing policies, marketing regulations, and socioeconomic
    conditions. Communities with higher outlet density and fewer alcohol control policies have higher
    consumption rates. Equity implications include differential exposure to alcohol marketing and availability
    in lower-income and minority communities.
