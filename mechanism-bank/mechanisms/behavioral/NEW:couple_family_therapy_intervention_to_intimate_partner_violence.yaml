description: This comprehensive methodological and substantive review of couple and
  family therapy research from 2001-2011 identifies interpersonal violence as one
  of 10 substantive areas with evidence supporting family-based interventions. The
  review synthesizes quantitative research evaluating intervention effectiveness across
  multiple domains, rating content areas on methodological strength dimensions. The
  inclusion of interpersonal violence as a distinct content area in this systematic
  review indicates accumulated evidence supporting couple and family therapy approaches
  for reducing intimate partner violence.
