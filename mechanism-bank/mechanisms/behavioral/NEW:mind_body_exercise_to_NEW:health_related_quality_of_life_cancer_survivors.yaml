direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cancer survivors engage in mind-body exercises such as Tai Chi, Qigong,
  or Yoga at an optimal dose of approximately 390 METs-min/week'
- 'Step 2: These practices integrate physical movement with mindfulness, breathing
  techniques, and meditation, addressing both physical and psychological dimensions
  of well-being'
- 'Step 3: The combined physical-mental engagement reduces stress, improves emotional
  regulation, enhances physical function, and decreases cancer-related fatigue and
  anxiety'
- 'Step 4: These improvements across multiple domains lead to significant enhancement
  in overall health-related quality of life in cancer survivors'

description: 'Mind-body exercises including Tai Chi, Qigong, and Yoga demonstrate
  significant positive effects on health-related quality of life in cancer survivors.
  Based on a Bayesian network meta-analysis of 48 RCTs involving 3050 cancer survivors,
  the optimal dose for mind-body exercises is 390 METs-min/week, yielding a standardized
  mean difference of 0.672 (95% CrI: 0.259-1.087). This represents a moderate-to-large
  effect size, indicating clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL.'
