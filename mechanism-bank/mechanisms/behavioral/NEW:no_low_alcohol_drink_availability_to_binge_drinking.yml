mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NoLo drinks become available in the market as harm reduction alternatives'
- 'Step 2: Heavy drinkers access NoLo products in addition to regular alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 3: NoLo drinks are consumed on top of usual alcohol consumption rather than as substitutes'
- 'Step 4: Total beverage consumption and potentially total alcohol exposure increases'

description: Epidemiological evidence indicates that heavy drinkers tend to use NoLo drinks as additions
  to rather than substitutions for their usual alcohol consumption, potentially undermining harm reduction
  goals.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how product availability policies intended for harm reduction
    may have different effects across drinking subpopulations. Structural interventions must account for
    heterogeneous responses - what works for moderate drinkers may not work for heavy drinkers. Policy
    should differentiate strategies by population risk level.
