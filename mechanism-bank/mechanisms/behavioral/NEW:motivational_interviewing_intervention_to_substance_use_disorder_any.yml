direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Motivational interviewing (MI) provides a client-centered therapeutic approach that creates
  an atmosphere of acceptance and compassion'
- 'Step 2: MI explores the individual''s own reasons for change and helps resolve ambivalence about substance
  use'
- 'Step 3: This process strengthens intrinsic motivation and commitment to behavior change goals'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced motivation translates to reduced substance use behaviors compared to no intervention'

description: Motivational interviewing, a client-centered counseling approach, demonstrates small to moderate
  effectiveness in reducing substance use compared to no intervention, particularly in the short-term.
  This systematic review of 93 RCTs with 22,776 participants found MI may reduce substance use up to short
  follow-up periods when compared to no intervention.

  description: Quality of MI implementation matters - authors note importance of counselors adhering to
    and reporting quality conditions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While MI is an individual-level intervention, its availability is structurally
    determined by healthcare system access, treatment facility density, and workforce training capacity.
    The diverse settings studied (prisons, veterans' centers, clinics) reflect how structural factors
    determine access to evidence-based behavioral interventions. Equity implications include differential
    access to MI-trained providers across communities.
