mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption directly damages DNA and produces carcinogenic metabolites
  like acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol may interact synergistically with dietary factors to promote carcinogenesis
  in multiple organ systems'
- 'Step 3: Combined alcohol and dietary exposures increase risk of multiple cancer
  types including esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancers'
