description: Yoga and meditation interventions delivered in nature settings as part of social prescription
  programs demonstrate significant effects on mental health outcomes through combined mind-body and environmental
  pathways.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Social prescription of yoga and meditation in nature addresses barriers to both
    mental health services and wellness practices that disproportionately affect lower-income populations.
    By integrating these into healthcare systems, structural barriers related to cost and access are reduced.
