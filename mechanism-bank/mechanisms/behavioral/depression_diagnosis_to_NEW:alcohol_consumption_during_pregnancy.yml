- 'Step 1: Pregnant women experience depression, often due to inadequate mental health screening and support
  services'

- 'Step 3: Limited access to mental health treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa perpetuates untreated depression'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol consumption during pregnancy as a maladaptive coping strategy'

  description: Access to mental health services may reduce the depression-alcohol pathway
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural failures in mental health infrastructure in
    Sub-Saharan Africa, where inadequate screening, stigma, and limited treatment options leave pregnant
    women with untreated depression vulnerable to alcohol use as a coping mechanism. The pathway is not
    about individual moral failing but systemic healthcare gaps.
