direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher quality studies exclude former drinkers and occasional drinkers from abstainer reference
  groups, eliminating ''sick quitter'' bias'
- 'Step 2: Studies with younger cohorts (≤55 years) followed beyond age 55 reduce selection bias from
  health-based abstention'
- 'Step 3: Elimination of lifetime selection biases removes spurious protective associations between low-volume
  drinking and mortality'
- 'Step 4: Higher quality studies find no significant mortality benefit from low-volume alcohol consumption
  (RR=0.98, 0.87-1.11)'
- 'Step 5: This contrasts with lower quality studies showing apparent protective effects (RR=0.84, 0.79-0.89)'

description: This meta-analysis demonstrates that the apparent health benefits of low-volume alcohol consumption
  found in many epidemiological studies are largely artifacts of methodological biases. When studies properly
  account for lifetime selection biases (excluding former and occasional drinkers from abstainer groups,
  using younger cohorts), the protective association disappears. This has profound implications for public
  health messaging and drinking guidelines.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how research methodology itself becomes a structural determinant
    of health messaging. Flawed epidemiological evidence has been used to justify drinking guidelines
    that may cause population-level harm. The alcohol industry may benefit from continued dissemination
    of studies showing protective effects. Correcting this evidence base is essential for evidence-based
    public health policy.
