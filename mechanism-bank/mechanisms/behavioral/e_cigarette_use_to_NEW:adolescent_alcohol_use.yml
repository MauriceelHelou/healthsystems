mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: E-cigarette use among adolescents creates nicotine exposure and addiction pathways'
- 'Step 2: Shared risk factors and gateway effects increase susceptibility to other substance use'
- 'Step 3: Social contexts where e-cigarette use occurs often involve alcohol availability'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological effects of nicotine on adolescent brain development may increase vulnerability
  to alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: Co-use patterns become established leading to increased any alcohol consumption'

description: E-cigarette users had a significantly higher risk of any alcohol use compared to non-e-cigarette
  users, with over 6-fold increased odds. This association was even stronger among high school students
  specifically.

  description: High school ECIG users showed higher odds of alcohol use (OR 8.17, 95% CI 5.95-11.2) compared
    to overall pooled estimate
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural factors including marketing of e-cigarettes
    to youth, regulatory gaps in e-cigarette sales, and environments where both substances are accessible.
    Interventions should target policy-level changes rather than individual behavior change alone. The
    co-occurrence suggests need for integrated prevention approaches addressing multiple substance use.
