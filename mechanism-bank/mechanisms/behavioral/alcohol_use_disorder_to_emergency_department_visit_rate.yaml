direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with alcohol use disorder experience acute intoxication episodes,
  withdrawal symptoms, and alcohol-related injuries requiring immediate medical attention'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol use leads to medical complications including liver disease,
  gastrointestinal bleeding, infections, and trauma that necessitate emergency care'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with alcohol use disorder often lack regular primary care access
  and use ED as their primary healthcare source, resulting in higher ED utilization
  rates'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related presentations contribute up to one-third of ED visits among
  vulnerable populations, with repeat visits common due to ongoing substance use'

description: Alcohol use disorder significantly increases emergency department visit
  rates through multiple pathways including acute intoxication episodes, withdrawal
  emergencies, alcohol-related injuries, and chronic medical complications. A systematic
  review of 36 studies found that alcohol-related diagnoses contributed up to one-third
  of ED visits among vulnerable populations. The relationship is particularly pronounced
  among persons experiencing homelessness who use EDs as their primary healthcare
  source, with visit rates 1.63 to 18.75 times higher than general populations.
