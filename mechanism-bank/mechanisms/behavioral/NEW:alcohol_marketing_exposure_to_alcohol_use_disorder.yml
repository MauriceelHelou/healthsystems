  description: Cognition studies show advertisements focusing on appealing contexts and outcomes may be
    less easily extinguished in adolescent populations, creating lasting effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces harmful alcohol outcomes to commercial marketing practices
    rather than individual choice. The paper identifies policy restrictions on advertising as effective
    structural interventions, shifting focus from individual responsibility to industry regulation. More
    research is needed on impacts on people already experiencing dependence.
