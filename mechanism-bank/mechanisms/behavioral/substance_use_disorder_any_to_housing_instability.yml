- 'Step 1: Substance dependency consumes financial resources needed for housing costs'
- 'Step 2: Substance use may lead to eviction or barriers to rental applications'
- 'Step 3: Many housing programs require sobriety, excluding those with active substance use'
- 'Step 4: Substance dependency creates barriers to successful transition to stable housing'
- 'Step 5: Bidirectional cycle reinforces both homelessness and substance use'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism includes substance use as a factor affecting housing, the
    structural framing emphasizes that housing policies and program requirements create barriers rather
    than simply blaming individual substance use. Housing-first approaches that do not require sobriety
    represent a structural intervention to break this cycle. The equity implication is that populations
    facing intersecting disadvantages (trauma history, poverty, discrimination) face compounded barriers
    to both sobriety and housing.
