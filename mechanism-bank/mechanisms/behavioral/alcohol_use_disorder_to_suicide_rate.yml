  node_name: Suicide Rate
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder involves chronic heavy drinking that dysregulates neurotransmitter systems
  including serotonin and dopamine'
- 'Step 2: Neurobiological changes impair impulse control, emotional regulation, and decision-making capacity'
- 'Step 3: AUD frequently co-occurs with depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions that
  elevate suicide risk'
- 'Step 4: Social consequences of AUD (relationship breakdown, job loss, financial problems) create psychosocial
  stressors'
- 'Step 5: Increased risk of suicidal behavior including suicide attempts and death by suicide'

description: This systematic review protocol aims to determine the gender-specific risk of suicidal behaviors
  (suicide attempt and death by suicide) among individuals with alcohol use disorder. The review will
  synthesize evidence on how AUD differentially affects suicide risk by gender.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While AUD is often framed as individual pathology, structural factors shape AUD
    prevalence including alcohol marketing, pricing policies, outlet density, and access to treatment.
    Gender differences in suicide risk may reflect gendered social stressors, differential help-seeking
    patterns shaped by social norms, and unequal access to mental health services. The protocol appropriately
    examines gender as a structural modifier rather than individual characteristic.
