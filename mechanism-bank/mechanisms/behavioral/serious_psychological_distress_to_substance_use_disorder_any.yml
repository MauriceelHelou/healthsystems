- 'Step 1: Pandemic conditions create elevated psychological distress in the population'
- 'Step 2: Mobility restrictions limit access to mental health treatment and social support'
- 'Step 3: Psychological distress increases vulnerability to substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged distress and substance use may develop into diagnosable substance use disorders'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While mental health is often framed as individual-level, this study appropriately
    contextualizes psychological distress within structural conditions (pandemic, policy responses, societal
    disruption). The structural determinants include access to mental health care, social support systems
    disrupted by policy, and economic stressors - all of which are unequally distributed across populations
    by race, class, and geography.
