  and brain'

description: Higher levels of alcohol consumption exponentially increase the risk of dying from alcohol
  use disorder or 100% alcohol-attributable causes. At four standard drinks per day, mortality risk is
  fourfold compared to non-drinkers. Even at 20g/day, mortality risk approximately doubles.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol-related mortality is shaped by structural factors including healthcare
    access for treatment of AUD and alcohol-related diseases, availability of medication-assisted treatment,
    insurance coverage for substance use treatment, and social support systems. Lower-income individuals
    and communities of color face greater barriers to treatment access, contributing to mortality disparities.
