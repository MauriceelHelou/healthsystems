direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorders impair cognitive functioning, decision-making capacity,
  and impulse control, leading to difficulties maintaining employment and stable income'
- 'Step 2: Financial instability from job loss, combined with potential expenditure
  on substances, depletes resources needed for housing costs (rent, utilities, deposits)'
- 'Step 3: Substance use disorders strain social relationships and support networks,
  reducing access to informal housing assistance from family and friends'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral consequences of substance use (legal issues, evictions, housing
  rule violations) create barriers to obtaining and maintaining stable housing'
- 'Step 5: The 44% prevalence of any substance use disorder among homeless populations
  indicates a strong bidirectional relationship where substance use both precedes
  and follows housing loss'

description: Substance use disorders significantly increase the risk of homelessness
  through multiple interconnected pathways including employment instability, financial
  depletion, social network erosion, and housing access barriers. This meta-analysis
  of 85 studies found that 44% of people experiencing homelessness have any substance
  use disorder, substantially higher than general population rates. The relationship
  is likely bidirectional, with substance use both contributing to housing loss and
  potentially developing or worsening after becoming homeless.
