mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medical management of kidney disease includes restrictions on fluid and alcohol intake'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers counsel patients on avoiding alcohol due to medication interactions and
  kidney damage'
- 'Step 3: Physical symptoms and illness may reduce desire for alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Social isolation may reduce exposure to drinking environments'
- 'Step 5: Young adults on RRT show trend toward higher alcohol abstinence though not statistically significant'

description: Young adults on RRT showed a non-significant trend toward higher alcohol abstinence (RR 1.96
  for abstinence), suggesting reduced alcohol use in this population though evidence is limited.

  equity_implications: The potential protective effect against alcohol use reflects medical necessity
    rather than health behavior choice. However, reduced alcohol use may be offset by social isolation
    and reduced quality of life. Healthcare systems should address psychosocial wellbeing alongside behavioral
    counseling.
