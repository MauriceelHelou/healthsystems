mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorder creates competing priorities that interfere with healthcare engagement'
- 'Step 2: Active substance use may interact negatively with antiretroviral medications'
- 'Step 3: Substance use and mental health conditions mutually reinforce each other in syndemic fashion'
- 'Step 4: The syndemic interaction of HIV, mental health, and substance use compounds barriers to viral
  suppression'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Substance use disorders should be understood within the context of structural factors
    including lack of treatment access, criminalization policies, and socioeconomic stressors rather than
    individual moral failings. The syndemic framework recognizes how multiple conditions interact within
    social and structural contexts.
