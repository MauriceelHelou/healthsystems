direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol intoxication impairs motor coordination, judgment, and reaction time'
- 'Step 2: Impaired individuals engage in high-risk activities (driving, physical altercations, falls)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced protective reflexes during falls or impacts increase injury severity'
- 'Step 4: Intoxication-related incidents lead to traumatic brain injuries requiring hospitalization'

description: Alcohol intoxication is identified as one of the strongest predictors of traumatic brain
  injury, with a substantial proportion of TBIs occurring in intoxicated individuals. The mechanism operates
  through impaired judgment, coordination, and protective reflexes.

  description: Higher blood alcohol levels likely increase risk of TBI through greater impairment
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While framed as individual behavior, alcohol use disorder is shaped by structural
    factors including alcohol outlet density, marketing targeting vulnerable communities, economic stress,
    and lack of treatment access. Populations with fewer resources for recovery and greater environmental
    exposure to alcohol face disproportionate risk.
