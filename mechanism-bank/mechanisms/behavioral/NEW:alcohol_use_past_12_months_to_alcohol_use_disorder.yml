direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Initial alcohol use establishes exposure to addictive substance'
- 'Step 2: Among users, a subset develops patterns of regular or heavy episodic drinking'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological changes from repeated use lead to tolerance and dependence'
- 'Step 4: Clinical alcohol use disorder develops in vulnerable individuals'

description: Among the population using alcohol in the Eastern Mediterranean region, some progress to
  alcohol use disorder. The review found limited but heterogeneous data on AUD prevalence across several
  countries in the region.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Data on alcohol use disorder and heavy drinking were limited to several countries with
    heterogeneous indicators
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this represents a behavioral pathway, the structural context matters - limited
    AUD treatment infrastructure and potential stigma around help-seeking in the region may affect both
    recognition and treatment of AUD. The review notes that 16.9% (95% CI 8.8-26.9%) of treatment-seeking
    substance users identified alcohol as their primary substance.
