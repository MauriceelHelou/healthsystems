- 'Step 1: Cognitive engagement stimulates neural activity and synaptic plasticity'
- 'Step 2: Active neural networks enhance waste clearance and metabolic function'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive reserve provides resilience against pathological amyloid effects'
- 'Step 4: Higher cognitive activity may slow or reduce amyloid accumulation'

  amyloid pathology, supporting the cognitive reserve hypothesis in dementia prevention.

  equity_implications: Access to cognitive stimulation is shaped by educational attainment, employment
    type, library and community program availability, and digital access. Educational equity policies
    and community programming represent upstream determinants of cognitive activity opportunities.
