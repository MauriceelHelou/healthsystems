direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking leads to episodic high-dose alcohol consumption that exceeds
  the liver''s metabolic capacity'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism in hepatocytes generates acetaldehyde and increases
  NADH/NAD+ ratio, disrupting lipid metabolism'
- 'Step 3: Impaired fatty acid oxidation and increased lipogenesis result in triglyceride
  accumulation within hepatocytes'
- 'Step 4: Repeated binge episodes cause progressive hepatic steatosis (fatty liver),
  the most common initial stage of alcohol-related liver disease'

  episodes of excessive alcohol intake that overwhelm hepatic metabolic capacity.
  Alcohol-related steatosis is the most common stage of alcohol-related liver disease
  (ArLD), characterized by fat accumulation in liver cells. While this stage has a
  relatively low rate of progression to cirrhosis (approximately 3% per year), it
  represents the foundational pathology that can advance to more severe liver disease
  including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis.
