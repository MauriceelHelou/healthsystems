description: 18.74% of individuals with bipolar disorder meet criteria for alcohol abuse, representing
  a substantial population engaging in harmful drinking patterns that may not yet meet dependence criteria
  but cause significant impairment.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 18.74
    type: percentage_change
  sample_size: 32886
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: 12-country sample suggests geographic variation related to alcohol availability, cultural
    norms, and healthcare system differences
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The 18.74% alcohol abuse prevalence represents an intervention opportunity - these
    individuals have not yet developed dependence and could benefit from early intervention. Structural
    barriers including mental health treatment shortages, lack of screening integration, and fragmented
    care systems prevent early identification and intervention.
