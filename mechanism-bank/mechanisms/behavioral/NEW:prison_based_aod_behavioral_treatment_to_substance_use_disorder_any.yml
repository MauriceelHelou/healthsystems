  review synthesizes evidence on the effectiveness of various treatment approaches.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The prevalence of substance use disorders among incarcerated populations reflects
    structural inequities in access to community-based treatment, the criminalization of addiction, and
    socioeconomic factors driving both substance use and incarceration. While prison-based treatment addresses
    an immediate need, it operates within a system that disproportionately incarcerates low-income individuals
    and people of color. A structural approach would prioritize prevention and community-based treatment
    to reduce reliance on carceral settings for addressing public health issues.
