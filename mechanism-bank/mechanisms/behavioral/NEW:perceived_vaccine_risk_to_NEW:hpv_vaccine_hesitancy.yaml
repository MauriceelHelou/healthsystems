  node_name: HPV Vaccine Hesitancy
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parents and adolescents engage in risk-benefit assessment, weighing perceived
  risks of HPV infection against perceived risks of vaccination'
- 'Step 2: When vaccine risks are perceived as high relative to disease risks (e.g.,
  concerns about side effects, safety, or long-term consequences), this creates psychological
  barriers to vaccination'
- 'Step 3: These elevated risk perceptions lead to delayed or refused vaccination
  decisions, manifesting as vaccine hesitancy'
- 'Step 4: Hesitancy is reinforced by lack of trust in vaccines and vaccination programs,
  contributing to vaccine coverage below optimal levels'

description: Perception of HPV vaccination risks relative to disease risks is a key
  psychological/behavioral barrier to vaccine uptake. When individuals perceive vaccine
  risks as high compared to HPV disease risks, they are more likely to delay or refuse
  vaccination. This systematic review of 24 UK studies (2017-2023) identified risk
  perception as one of several important barriers contributing to vaccine hesitancy
  and suboptimal coverage rates.
