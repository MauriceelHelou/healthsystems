description: Among individuals with hazardous drinking habits, early alcohol initiation (before age 19)
  was associated with 32% higher mortality risk compared to those who initiated at age 19 or older, indicating
  synergistic effects between drinking patterns and initiation age

  description: Among hazardous drinkers, earlier age at first drink (<19) significantly amplifies mortality
    risk compared to later initiation (≥19)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural factors (alcohol availability, marketing
    to youth, cultural norms) that enable early initiation create long-term health consequences that are
    amplified by subsequent hazardous drinking. Structural interventions including alcohol pricing policies,
    marketing restrictions, and treatment access are appropriate responses rather than individual blame.
