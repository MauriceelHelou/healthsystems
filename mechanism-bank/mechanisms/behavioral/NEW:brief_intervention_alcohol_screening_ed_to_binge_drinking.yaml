direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency department patients are screened for alcohol use, identifying
  those with problematic drinking patterns including binge drinking'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions (BI) are delivered to identified patients, involving
  motivational interviewing, feedback on drinking behaviors, and personalized advice'
- 'Step 3: Patients receive information about health risks and are prompted to reflect
  on their drinking patterns during a teachable moment following injury/intoxication'
- 'Step 4: This reflection and counseling leads to increased awareness and motivation
  to change drinking behavior'
- 'Step 5: Patients reduce heavy drinking episodes and overall alcohol consumption
  at follow-up assessments'

description: Brief interventions with alcohol screening in emergency departments produce
  small but statistically significant reductions in alcohol consumption including
  heavy drinking episodes. A meta-analysis of 28 RCTs with 14,456 patients found consistent
  effects across 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up periods. The effect is modest (SMD =
  0.19) but robust, with low heterogeneity. Notably, shorter interventions are as
  effective as longer ones, and non-face-to-face delivery may be equally effective.
