direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ICBT integrates trauma-focused cognitive behavioral techniques with substance
  use disorder treatment components, addressing both conditions simultaneously'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive restructuring components help patients identify and modify maladaptive
  trauma-related cognitions and beliefs that maintain PTSD symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Behavioral interventions target avoidance patterns and substance use as
  maladaptive coping strategies, replacing them with healthier coping skills'
- 'Step 4: Integrated approach addresses the bidirectional relationship between PTSD
  and substance use, preventing substance use from interfering with trauma processing'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in PTSD symptom severity as measured by standardized assessments
  post-treatment'

description: Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) demonstrates a modest
  but significant negative effect on PTSD severity in individuals with comorbid PTSD
  and substance use disorder. The meta-analysis found a standardized mean difference
  of -0.33, indicating that ICBT reduces PTSD symptoms compared to control conditions.
  This effect was specific to ICBT among cognitive restructuring interventions, suggesting
  its integrated approach targeting both conditions simultaneously provides added
  benefit for PTSD outcomes.
