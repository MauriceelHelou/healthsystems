mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traumatic event exposure leads to development of PTSD symptoms including hyperarousal, intrusion,
  and avoidance'
- 'Step 2: PTSD symptoms create significant psychological distress and emotional dysregulation'
- 'Step 3: Individuals use alcohol as a coping mechanism to self-medicate distressing PTSD symptoms (drinking-to-cope)'
- 'Step 4: Repeated alcohol use for symptom relief leads to tolerance, dependence, and problematic drinking
  patterns'
- 'Step 5: Problematic alcohol use develops into alcohol use disorder through reinforcement of drinking
  to cope'

description: The self-medication hypothesis posits that individuals with PTSD use alcohol to cope with
  trauma-related symptoms. This systematic review of 24 studies found evidence supporting this model,
  though findings were inconsistent due to methodological limitations including problems with operationalizing
  trauma-related drinking to cope.

  description: The operationalization of trauma-related drinking to cope as a mediating variable strengthens
    the relationship; however, methodological limitations in how this is measured affect findings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While this mechanism involves individual behavior, the structural context is critical:
    trauma exposure is often rooted in structural violence, systemic inequities, and community-level adversity.
    Populations experiencing higher rates of trauma exposure (e.g., combat veterans, survivors of interpersonal
    violence, communities experiencing discrimination) face disproportionate risk. Structural factors
    including lack of access to trauma-informed mental health care, economic barriers to treatment, and
    social environments that normalize drinking as coping all contribute to this pathway. Prevention efforts
    should address upstream structural determinants of trauma exposure rather than focusing solely on
    individual coping behaviors.'
