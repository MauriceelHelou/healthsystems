direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tuberculosis diagnosis creates significant psychological distress and social stigma'
- 'Step 2: Chronic illness burden and lengthy treatment regimens (6+ months) increase stress and coping
  challenges'
- 'Step 3: Social isolation due to TB stigma may lead to maladaptive coping mechanisms including alcohol
  use'
- 'Step 4: Economic strain from illness-related work loss and healthcare costs contributes to psychosocial
  vulnerability'
- 'Step 5: High prevalence of alcohol use disorder (30%) in TB patients reflects intersection of disease
  burden and substance use'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 studies (n=30,854 TB patients) found a high
  average prevalence of alcohol use disorder (30%, 95% CI: 24-35%) among tuberculosis patients. AUD complicates
  TB management through poor treatment compliance and worse treatment outcomes. The relationship varies
  by geographic region, study design, participant age, and assessment methods.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how infectious disease burden intersects with substance
    use disorders, reflecting structural factors including healthcare system capacity for integrated screening,
    social stigma surrounding both TB and AUD, economic stress from chronic illness, and geographic variation
    in healthcare resources. The finding that prevalence varies by continent suggests structural determinants
    (healthcare access, social support systems, economic conditions) differ across regions. The call for
    early screening and management of AUD in TB patients points to healthcare system gaps rather than
    individual behavioral failures.
