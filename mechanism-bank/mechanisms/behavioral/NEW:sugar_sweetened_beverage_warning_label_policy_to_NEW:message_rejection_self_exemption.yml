  node_name: Health Message Rejection and Self-Exemption
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Warning labels present health risk information that may threaten self-concept or current behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Individuals who perceive themselves as physically active or otherwise healthy find opportunities
  for self-exemption'
- 'Step 3: Message misinterpretation or rejection reduces intended behavioral impact of labels'
- 'Step 4: Self-exemption maintains current SSB consumption patterns despite label exposure'

description: Warning labels can paradoxically trigger self-exemption behaviors where individuals who perceive
  themselves as healthy or physically active reject the message's personal relevance, reducing the policy's
  effectiveness for certain population segments.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a limitation of information-based policy interventions
    - they may be differentially effective across populations. Those with higher perceived health status
    may exempt themselves, potentially creating equity issues where labels work better for those already
    concerned about health. This highlights the need for complementary structural interventions (taxation,
    availability restrictions) that do not rely solely on individual message processing.
