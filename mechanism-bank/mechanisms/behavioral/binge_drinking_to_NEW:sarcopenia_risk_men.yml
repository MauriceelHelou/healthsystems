mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption in men shows distinct association pattern with muscle health compared to
  overall population'
- 'Step 2: Potential mechanisms may include hormonal interactions (testosterone-alcohol interactions)
  affecting muscle protein synthesis'
- 'Step 3: Sex-specific drinking patterns and amounts may contribute to differential muscle mass effects'
- 'Step 4: Lower sarcopenia risk observed in male alcohol consumers compared to non-consumers'

description: Subgroup analysis by sex revealed that alcohol consumption was significantly associated with
  lower sarcopenia risk specifically in men (OR=0.763, P=.010). This sex-specific finding suggests biological
  or behavioral differences in how alcohol affects muscle mass between men and women. However, authors
  urge caution in interpreting this as evidence of protective effects given overall null findings and
  known harms of alcohol.

    Gender norms influence drinking patterns, types of alcohol consumed, and contexts of consumption.
    Men's alcohol consumption patterns are shaped by workplace cultures, social expectations, and marketing
    targeting male demographics. Any policy implications must consider that promoting alcohol consumption
    for muscle health would be inappropriate given comprehensive alcohol-related harms disproportionately
    affecting certain populations.
