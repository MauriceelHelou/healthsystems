- 'Step 1: Contextual alcohol advertising includes party scenes, sports iconography, and/or attractive
  characters'
- 'Step 2: These elements create emotional associations linking alcohol with social success, fun, and
  desirable lifestyles'
- 'Step 3: Young viewers report higher attention to and appeal of contextual versus neutral advertisements'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced engagement with advertising content increases perceived image benefits associated
  with alcohol consumption'

description: Alcohol advertisements featuring contextual imagery (party and sport scenes) with or without
  human characters generate significantly more positive reactions across multiple dimensions (attention,
  appeal, product perception, consumption perception, image benefits) and higher perceived behavioral
  impact compared to neutral advertisements showing only bottles and logos. This demonstrates the persuasive
  power of lifestyle marketing in alcohol advertising.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism documents how commercial marketing practices serve as structural
    determinants of health behaviors. The alcohol industry's use of contextual imagery exploits psychological
    processes to create positive associations with drinking, particularly among young people who are developmentally
    susceptible to social influence. Understanding this mechanism supports policy interventions that regulate
    advertising content rather than expecting individuals to resist sophisticated marketing tactics.
