direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students receive brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) including Motivational Interviewing
  with Personalized Feedback, Group MI, or stand-alone Personalized Feedback'
- 'Step 2: Interventions increase awareness of personal alcohol consumption patterns and associated risks
  through personalized normative feedback'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced motivation and self-efficacy for behavior change reduces heavy episodic drinking occasions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced frequency of heavy drinking occasions decreases opportunities for impaired driving
  decisions'
- 'Step 5: Lower prevalence of driving after consuming 4+/5+ drinks among intervention recipients'

description: Brief alcohol interventions delivered to college students reduce the risk of driving after
  heavy drinking (4+/5+ drinks) by 19% compared to control conditions. The meta-analysis of individual
  participant data from 15 RCTs (n=6801) found that individually delivered Motivational Interviewing with
  Personalized Feedback was the most effective intervention format. Effects were not significant for lower
  drinking thresholds (2+/3+ drinks).

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism operates through an institutional intervention structure (college-based
    prevention programs). The effectiveness depends on institutional capacity to deliver evidence-based
    interventions. Equity implications include whether all students have equal access to these programs
    and whether interventions are culturally adapted for diverse student populations. The study population
    was 72% White and 58% first-year students, suggesting potential limitations in generalizability to
    more diverse populations.
