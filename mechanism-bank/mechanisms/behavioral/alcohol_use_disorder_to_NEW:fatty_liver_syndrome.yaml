direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to excessive intake of ethanol, which
  is metabolized primarily in the liver'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism generates toxic byproducts (acetaldehyde) and increases
  oxidative stress in hepatocytes'
- 'Step 3: Chronic alcohol exposure disrupts hepatic lipid metabolism, impairing fatty
  acid oxidation and promoting lipogenesis'
- 'Step 4: Fat accumulates in hepatocytes (steatosis), leading to alcoholic fatty
  liver disease'
- 'Step 5: Continued alcohol use disorder promotes progression from simple steatosis
  to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and potentially cirrhosis'

description: Alcohol use disorder is a major contributor to fatty liver syndrome globally.
  Chronic excessive alcohol consumption causes direct hepatotoxic effects through
  alcohol metabolism, leading to fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis). The disease
  can progress through stages including steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and ultimately
  cirrhosis with liver-related complications.
