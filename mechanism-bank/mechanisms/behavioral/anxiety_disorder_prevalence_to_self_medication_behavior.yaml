direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with anxiety disorders experience distressing symptoms including
  excessive worry, physical anxiety symptoms, and emotional distress that interfere
  with daily functioning'
- 'Step 2: To cope with these symptoms and avoid formal mental health treatment, individuals
  turn to accessible substances (alcohol, cannabis, prescription opioids, benzodiazepines)
  as a maladaptive coping mechanism'
- 'Step 3: This self-medication behavior provides temporary symptom relief but can
  lead to substance use disorders and dependency, particularly among those with social
  anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and PTSD'

description: Anxiety disorders significantly increase the risk of self-medication
  behaviors through a pathway where individuals use substances to manage distressing
  anxiety symptoms. This relationship is particularly strong for social anxiety disorder
  predicting alcohol use disorders, and generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD predicting
  opioid use. The self-medication hypothesis is supported by longitudinal evidence
  showing anxiety disorders temporally precede substance use in most cases, with hazard
  ratios ranging from 1.70 to 10.8 depending on the specific anxiety disorder and
  substance type.
structural_competency_notes: Access to formal mental health care, healthcare affordability,
  stigma around mental health treatment, and availability of substances without prescription
  (particularly in healthcare settings) all influence whether individuals with anxiety
  disorders resort to self-medication rather than seeking appropriate clinical treatment.
