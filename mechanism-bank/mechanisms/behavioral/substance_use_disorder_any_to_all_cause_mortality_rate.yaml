direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorders lead to direct physiological harm through toxic
  effects of substances on vital organs (liver, heart, brain, lungs)'
- 'Step 2: Injection drug use and risky behaviors associated with substance use increase
  risk of infectious disease transmission (HIV, hepatitis C, bacterial infections)'
- 'Step 3: Substance use disorders impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors,
  leading to overdoses, accidents, and injuries'
- 'Step 4: Social marginalization reduces access to healthcare, stable housing, and
  social support systems'
- 'Step 5: Co-occurring mental health conditions and multimorbidity compound health
  risks and reduce treatment engagement'
- 'Step 6: Cumulative physiological damage, delayed healthcare seeking, and acute
  events (overdose) result in dramatically elevated mortality rates'

description: Individuals with substance use disorders in high-income countries experience
  dramatically elevated all-cause mortality with a standardized mortality ratio of
  11.86 (95% CI 10.42-13.30), indicating nearly 12 times higher mortality compared
  to the general population. This elevated mortality reflects extreme health inequities
  driven by direct physiological harm from substances, increased infectious disease
  risk, overdose deaths, social marginalization limiting healthcare access, and multimorbidity.
  The effect was consistent across 99% of 92 extracted datapoints.
