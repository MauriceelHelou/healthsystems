direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute alcohol intoxication impairs pedestrian judgment and road-crossing behavior'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol reduces protective reflexes and ability to respond to oncoming traffic'
- 'Step 3: Intoxicated pedestrians sustain more severe traumatic injuries upon vehicle impact'
- 'Step 4: Severity of injuries leads to fatal outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations (women,
  elderly)'

description: Alcohol intoxication among pedestrians contributes to fatal traffic crash outcomes by increasing
  the severity of injuries sustained. The study of 200 fatal pedestrian victims hit by passenger cars
  found that alcohol concentration significantly affects injury severity, with more pronounced effects
  when using comprehensive injury severity scales and among female victims.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'Structural factors underlying this mechanism include: alcohol availability and
    pricing policies that influence intoxication prevalence, built environment features (sidewalk completeness,
    pedestrian crossings, street lighting) that fail to protect vulnerable road users, transportation
    policy that necessitates pedestrian travel in car-centric environments, and lack of safe sobering
    facilities or transportation alternatives. The gender disparity suggests need for sex-specific approaches
    to road safety policy and emergency trauma care systems.'
