  node_name: Suicide Rate
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking episodes cause acute intoxication that impairs judgment and lowers behavioral
  inhibition'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol intoxication amplifies negative emotions and reduces cognitive capacity to consider
  consequences'
- 'Step 3: Acute intoxication facilitates transition from suicidal ideation to action'
- 'Step 4: Repeated binge drinking episodes cause cumulative neurological and psychosocial harm'
- 'Step 5: Elevated risk of both suicide attempts and death by suicide'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Binge drinking patterns are shaped by structural factors including alcohol pricing,
    marketing targeted to specific demographics, social environments that normalize heavy episodic drinking,
    and lack of alternative recreational opportunities. Gender differences may reflect differential social
    pressures, gendered drinking contexts, and varying physiological responses to alcohol.
