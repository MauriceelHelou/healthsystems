description: High-volume alcohol consumption is associated with 33% increased all-cause mortality risk
  (RR=1.33) compared to occasional drinking in the low-risk-of-bias review.

  equity_implications: High consumption levels show clear harm across all methodological approaches, supporting
    structural interventions like alcohol pricing policies, outlet density restrictions, and advertising
    regulations.
