- 'Step 1: African-American women encounter personal and interpersonal barriers including stigma, shame,
  and family responsibilities'
- 'Step 2: These barriers reduce psychological and social readiness to engage in treatment'

description: African-American women seeking substance use treatment are more likely to encounter treatment
  readiness barriers (personal and interpersonal factors like stigma, caregiving responsibilities, and
  lack of social support) compared to access or system-related barriers, which can impede successful treatment
  completion.

  description: The intersection of race, gender, and class creates compounding barriers that were noted
    as important but not directly addressed in reviewed literature
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The review identifies that treatment barriers are not simply individual failures
    but reflect structural inequities at the intersection of race, gender, and class. The authors explicitly
    note this intersectionality should be considered when removing treatment barriers, acknowledging that
    systemic factors shape individual treatment experiences.
