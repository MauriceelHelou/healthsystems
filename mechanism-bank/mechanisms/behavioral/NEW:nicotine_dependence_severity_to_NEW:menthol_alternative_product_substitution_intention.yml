direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher nicotine dependence creates stronger physiological need for continued nicotine delivery'
- 'Step 2: Dependent smokers more actively seek information about alternative nicotine/menthol sources'
- 'Step 3: Increased awareness of menthol accessories and non-menthol cooling cigarettes'
- 'Step 4: Higher likelihood of product trial and intention to substitute if menthol cigarettes restricted'

description: Nicotine dependence was consistently associated with awareness, ever use, and substitution
  intentions for both menthol accessories and non-menthol cooling cigarettes. This suggests more dependent
  smokers are more vulnerable to industry product innovations designed to maintain smoking.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While nicotine dependence has biological components, the structural context is
    tobacco industry exploitation of addiction through product innovation. Highly dependent smokers are
    not making free choices but responding to engineered products and strategic market entries. Policy
    must account for differential vulnerability based on dependence severity.
