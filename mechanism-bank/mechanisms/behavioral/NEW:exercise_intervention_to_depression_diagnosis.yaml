category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structured exercise interventions (walking/jogging, yoga, strength training)
  are prescribed to individuals meeting clinical criteria for major depressive disorder'
- 'Step 2: Regular physical activity triggers neurobiological changes including increased
  endorphin release, enhanced neurotransmitter regulation (serotonin, norepinephrine,
  dopamine), and reduced inflammation markers'
- 'Step 3: Exercise promotes neuroplasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis, improving
  cognitive function and emotional regulation'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral activation through exercise combats social withdrawal and provides
  structured activity, sense of accomplishment, and potential social engagement'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative physiological and psychological benefits lead to clinically
  meaningful reductions in depressive symptoms, with intensity-dependent effects (higher
  intensity yields greater benefits)'

description: A comprehensive network meta-analysis of 218 randomized controlled trials
  (14,170 participants) demonstrates that exercise interventions produce moderate
  reductions in depression compared to active controls. Walking/jogging showed the
  strongest effects (Hedges' g = -0.62), followed by yoga (g = -0.55) and strength
  training (g = -0.49). Effects were dose-dependent, with higher intensity exercise
  producing greater benefits. Yoga and strength training demonstrated the highest
  acceptability among participants. The evidence supports exercise as a core treatment
  for depression alongside psychotherapy and antidepressants.
