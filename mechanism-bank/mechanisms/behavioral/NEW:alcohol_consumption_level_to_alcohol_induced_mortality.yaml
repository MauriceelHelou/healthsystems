direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher levels of alcohol consumption create physiological dependence and
  neuroadaptive changes in the brain''s reward and stress systems'
- 'Step 2: Continued heavy drinking exponentially increases the risk of developing
  alcohol use disorder (AUD), with fourfold risk at 20g/day and sevenfold at 40g/day
  compared to non-drinkers'
- 'Step 3: AUD leads to progressive organ damage, particularly affecting liver (cirrhosis,
  hepatitis), cardiovascular system, and neurological function'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with AUD face compounding health risks from chronic heavy drinking,
  withdrawal complications, and associated comorbidities'
- 'Step 5: These cumulative effects result in significantly elevated mortality risk,
  approximately fourfold at 40g/day consumption, through 100% alcohol-attributable
  causes including alcoholic liver disease, alcohol poisoning, and alcohol-related
  cardiomyopathy'

description: 'Systematic review and meta-analysis establishing an exponential positive
  dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption levels and alcohol use disorder
  mortality. At moderate consumption (20g/day, approximately one large beer), mortality
  risk doubles compared to non-drinkers. At 40g/day (four standard drinks), the risk
  of AUD mortality increases approximately fourfold (RR=3.94, 95% CI: 3.53-4.40).
  The mortality rate among AUD patients was estimated at 3.13 per 1000 person-years.'

  description: The relationship is exponential - risk increases dramatically with
    higher consumption levels. At 20g/day the AUD mortality risk is approximately
    double that of non-drinkers; at 40g/day it is approximately fourfold
