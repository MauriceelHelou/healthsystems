mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption during pre-diagnosis period may affect tumor biology and treatment response'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol metabolites can cause oxidative stress and cellular damage'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol may affect immune function and tumor surveillance'
- 'Step 4: Meta-analysis demonstrates no significant association with breast cancer-specific mortality'

description: Pre-diagnosis alcohol consumption was not significantly associated with breast cancer-related
  mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.11, p=0.69) based on 19 cohort studies with 12,209 breast cancer deaths.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding is important for health equity as it suggests that breast cancer patients
    who consumed alcohol should not be blamed for their cancer outcomes. While alcohol prevention policies
    are important for primary cancer prevention, the prognosis after diagnosis appears independent of
    prior alcohol use.
