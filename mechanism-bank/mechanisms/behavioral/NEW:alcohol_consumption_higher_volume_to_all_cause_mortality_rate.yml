description: Higher-volume alcohol consumption is associated with 52% increased all-cause mortality risk
  (RR=1.52) compared to occasional drinking in the low-risk-of-bias review.

  effect_size:
    value: 1.52
    type: relative_risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The substantial mortality risk at higher consumption levels supports urgent need
    for structural interventions targeting alcohol availability, pricing, and treatment access. Equity
    implications exist as alcohol harm disproportionately affects lower socioeconomic groups despite similar
    or lower consumption.
