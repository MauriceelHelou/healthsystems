- 'Step 1: Very low alcohol consumption (approximately half a standard drink per day) represents the nadir
  of the J-shaped dose-response curve'
- 'Step 2: At this dose, potential anti-inflammatory or metabolic effects may occur without deleterious
  effects on muscle protein synthesis'
- 'Step 3: J-shaped relationship indicates risk increases both with abstinence and with higher consumption
  levels'
- 'Step 4: Lowest observed sarcopenia risk at 6.6g/day consumption level'

description: Nonlinear dose-response analysis revealed a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption
  and sarcopenia risk. The lowest risk was observed at 6.6 grams of alcohol per day (approximately half
  a standard drink), with OR=0.765. However, the authors explicitly caution that any suggestion of protective
  effect should be treated with caution given the overall lack of relationship in the comprehensive meta-analysis.

  equity_implications: The J-shaped finding, while statistically significant at the optimal dose, must
    be interpreted within broader public health context. Structural factors determine who has access to
    moderate vs. excessive alcohol, including socioeconomic status, alcohol outlet density in neighborhoods,
    and alcohol pricing policies. Promoting any level of alcohol consumption could exacerbate health inequities,
    as vulnerable populations may be more susceptible to alcohol-related harms. The cautious interpretation
    by authors models appropriate translation of epidemiologic findings to policy.
