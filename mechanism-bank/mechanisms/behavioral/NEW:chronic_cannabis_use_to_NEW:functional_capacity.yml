description: In individuals with bipolar disorder, chronic cannabis use (≥4x/weekly) is associated with
  functional capacity (UPSA-2 scores) comparable to healthy non-cannabis using participants, suggesting
  a potential normalizing effect on functional outcomes.

  description: Study notes impaired decision-making persists even in BD patients undergoing treatment,
    suggesting cannabis may provide additional benefit beyond standard pharmacotherapy
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to potential therapeutic cannabinoids is shaped by drug policy, socioeconomic
    status, and healthcare system structure. Criminalization of cannabis use may disproportionately harm
    individuals with mental health conditions who may derive functional benefit. Policy reform and research
    investment are needed to ensure equitable access to evidence-based cannabinoid treatments for psychiatric
    populations.
