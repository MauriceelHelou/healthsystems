mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Initial TBI combined with ongoing alcohol use disorder creates compounded vulnerability'
- 'Step 2: Post-TBI cognitive deficits impair judgment about safe alcohol consumption levels'
- 'Step 3: Continued intoxication episodes expose individual to same high-risk situations'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated neurological damage from prior TBI increases susceptibility to subsequent injuries'

description: Alcohol use after TBI is associated with additional head injuries, suggesting a cyclical
  relationship where the combined effects of TBI-related impairment and continued alcohol use create ongoing
  vulnerability to repeated traumatic brain injuries.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The cycle of TBI and AUD disproportionately affects populations with limited access
    to trauma-informed care, substance use treatment, and safe housing. Structural interventions addressing
    alcohol availability, treatment access, and social determinants of injury risk are needed to interrupt
    this cycle rather than focusing solely on individual behavior change.
