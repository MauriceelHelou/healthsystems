  anxiety disorders as psychological sequelae of early adversity'

  changes affecting reward and stress pathways'
- 'Step 4: Use of alcohol as a coping mechanism to self-medicate negative emotional
  states and manage chronic stress'
- 'Step 5: Escalation from alcohol misuse to binge and heavy drinking patterns'
- 'Step 6: Transition from problematic drinking to alcohol use disorder through neuroadaptive
  changes and reinforcement of maladaptive coping'

description: Adverse childhood experiences including childhood maltreatment and trauma
  lead to alcohol use disorder through multiple interconnected pathways involving
  stress system dysregulation, development of negative affect and mood/anxiety disorders,
  and subsequent use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. The pathway involves escalation
  from initial alcohol misuse to binge and heavy drinking, ultimately transitioning
  to AUD. This relationship is particularly pronounced in women, who show sex-specific
  biological and psychological mechanisms linking early adversity to alcohol problems.
