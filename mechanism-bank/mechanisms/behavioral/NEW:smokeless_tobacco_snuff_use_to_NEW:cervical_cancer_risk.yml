direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cultural practices among older African women include use of smokeless tobacco (snuff), which
  contains carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs)'
- 'Step 2: Intravaginal snuff use exposes cervical epithelium directly to carcinogens'
- 'Step 3: Local carcinogenic exposure promotes cellular transformation and oncogenesis in cervical tissue'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of cervical cancer development'

description: Ever use of smokeless tobacco (snuff) was associated with increased risk of cervical cancer
  among Black South African women, potentially mediated through intravaginal snuff use which is a cultural
  practice in this population.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural and cultural factors specific to Black South
    African women. The high prevalence of snuff use (22%) represents a culturally embedded practice among
    older African women. Addressing this requires culturally sensitive public health interventions rather
    than individual blame. The study population's limited access to health education and cancer screening
    services may compound exposure effects. Equity implications include the need for targeted prevention
    programs that acknowledge cultural practices while reducing harm.
