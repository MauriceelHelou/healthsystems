direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption reduces inhibition and impairs judgment'
- 'Step 2: Social contexts of drinking (parties, bars) increase opportunity for new sexual partnerships'
- 'Step 3: Impaired decision-making leads to less selective partner choices'
- 'Step 4: Pattern of alcohol use associated with increased number of sexual partners over time'

  description: Adolescent and young adult period represents heightened vulnerability due to brain development
    and social factors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Structural determinants include normalization of alcohol-linked sexual behavior
    in media and peer culture, inadequate prevention programming, and lack of comprehensive harm reduction
    approaches. The study recommends early-age drinking prevention programs supported by homes, schools,
    and communities - acknowledging that multi-level structural interventions are needed. Equity implications
    include differential exposure to alcohol marketing, varying quality of school-based prevention programs,
    and unequal access to youth development resources across communities.
