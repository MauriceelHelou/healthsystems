category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Achievement of ideal cardiovascular health metrics (smoking status, physical
  activity, diet, body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose)
  reflects adoption of healthier lifestyle behaviors and optimal physiological states'
- 'Step 2: Each additional ideal metric contributes to reduced atherosclerotic burden,
  decreased systemic inflammation, improved endothelial function, and better metabolic
  regulation'
- 'Step 3: The cumulative protective effect of multiple ideal metrics results in significantly
  lower risk of composite cardiovascular disease events including coronary heart disease,
  myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality'

description: This meta-analysis of 22 prospective studies involving over 3.2 million
  adults with mean follow-up of 12 years demonstrates that achieving a higher number
  of ideal cardiovascular health metrics (as defined by the American Heart Association's
  7-metric tool) is significantly associated with reduced risk of composite cardiovascular
  disease events, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. The relationship shows a dose-response
  pattern where even modest improvements in cardiovascular health metrics confer meaningful
  protective benefits.
