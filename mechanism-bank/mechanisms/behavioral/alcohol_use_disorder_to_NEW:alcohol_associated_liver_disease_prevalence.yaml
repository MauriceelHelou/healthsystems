direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) engage in chronic, excessive
  alcohol consumption that exceeds safe drinking thresholds'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol exposure causes direct hepatotoxic effects, leading to
  hepatocyte damage, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses in the liver'
- 'Step 3: Initial liver damage manifests as alcohol-associated fatty liver (steatosis),
  which can progress through continued alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 4: Persistent alcohol consumption in AUD leads to progressive liver injury
  including steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: The sustained pattern of heavy drinking characteristic of AUD dramatically
  increases the prevalence of alcohol-associated liver disease compared to general
  populations'

description: Alcohol use disorder is strongly associated with alcohol-associated liver
  disease prevalence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies found that
  51.0% of individuals with AUD have alcohol-associated liver disease, compared to
  only 3.5% in unselected populations. This represents an approximately 15-fold higher
  prevalence in AUD populations. The prevalence of alcohol-associated cirrhosis was
  12.9% in AUD groups compared to 0.3% in general populations, representing a 43-fold
  increase.
