description: Insomnia is theorized to undermine AUD treatment and increase relapse risk, though this meta-analysis
  found no significant differences in alcohol-related outcomes (craving, psychosocial problems, heavy-drinking/abstinent
  days) between CBT-I and control groups. The inconsistent reporting of alcohol outcomes limits conclusions
  about whether treating insomnia improves AUD outcomes.

  description: Alcohol-related outcomes were reported less consistently across studies, limiting ability
    to detect effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The comorbidity of insomnia and AUD reflects broader structural determinants including
    lack of integrated treatment approaches, socioeconomic stressors that contribute to both conditions,
    and healthcare systems that often treat these conditions separately rather than addressing their interconnection.
    The finding that alcohol outcomes were inconsistently measured across studies reflects structural
    gaps in research infrastructure and outcome standardization.
