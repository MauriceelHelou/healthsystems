description: Systematic review of 38 cross-sectional studies found consistent positive associations between
  exposure to alcohol marketing and alcohol use behaviors among adolescents and young adults. Evidence
  indicates that industry marketing through multiple channels (advertising, promotions, sponsorships,
  branded merchandise) is associated with increased drinking behaviors in youth populations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces alcohol use behaviors to structural determinants - specifically
    the commercial practices of the alcohol industry and the regulatory environment that permits marketing
    to youth populations. The pathway emphasizes industry practices and policy gaps rather than individual
    choice, highlighting how commercial determinants of health shape population-level behaviors. Equity
    implications include differential exposure to marketing in low-income communities and communities
    of color where alcohol advertising may be more concentrated.
