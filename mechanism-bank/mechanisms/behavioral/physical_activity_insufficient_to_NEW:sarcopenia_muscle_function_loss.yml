direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insufficient physical activity fails to provide adequate mechanical loading stimulus to muscle'
- 'Step 2: Without stimulus, fast-twitch muscle fibers undergo preferential atrophy with aging'
- 'Step 3: MyHC protein expression shifts toward slower isoforms'
- 'Step 4: Muscle force, velocity, and power decline'
- 'Step 5: Sarcopenia prevalence increases'

description: Physical activity level modifies the effects of aging on muscle fiber composition. Exercise
  interventions that promote physical activity could shift MyHC expression toward faster isoforms and
  increase fast-contracting fiber size, thereby decreasing sarcopenia prevalence.

  equity_implications: 'Physical activity levels are strongly influenced by structural factors including:
    access to parks and recreational facilities, walkability of neighborhoods, availability of age-appropriate
    exercise programs, economic resources for gym memberships, transportation access to exercise facilities,
    and safe environments for outdoor activity. These structural determinants create differential access
    to sarcopenia-preventing physical activity by socioeconomic status and geography.'
