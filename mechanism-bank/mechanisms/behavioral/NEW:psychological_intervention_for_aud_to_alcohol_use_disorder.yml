mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychological interventions (motivational interviewing, CBT) are delivered to people living
  with HIV/AIDS who have alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Interventions target cognitive and motivational factors underlying problematic drinking'
- 'Step 3: Some isolated effects on alcohol use are observed, though effect sizes are small and not sustained'
- 'Step 4: Lack of consistent evidence for significant reduction in alcohol use outcomes'

description: Systematic review of 21 RCTs (n=6954) examining psychological interventions for alcohol use
  disorders in people living with HIV/AIDS. Interventions included motivational interviewing, CBT, and
  group therapy. The review found lack of evidence for large or sustained intervention effects on alcohol
  use outcomes. Isolated effects were noted for some interventions but effect sizes were small and not
  sustained over time.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The review highlights structural barriers to effective treatment including reliance
    on self-report measures subject to social desirability bias, need for objective biomarkers, and methodological
    heterogeneity across studies. The focus on individual-level psychological interventions may overlook
    structural determinants of AUDs in PLWH including stigma, economic insecurity, and healthcare access
    barriers.
