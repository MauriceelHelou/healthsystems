direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-alcohol beer (<4%) consumption after exercise provides fluid volume for rehydration'
- 'Step 2: Lower alcohol content reduces diuretic effect compared to higher alcohol beverages'
- 'Step 3: Reduced fluid losses allow for more effective restoration of fluid balance'
- 'Step 4: Improved hydration status supports physiological recovery from exercise'

description: This systematic review found that low-alcohol beer (<4%) may be more effective for post-exercise
  rehydration compared to higher alcohol options. The mechanism involves reduced diuretic effects with
  lower alcohol content, allowing better fluid retention.

  equity_implications: While focused on individual consumption, this has implications for sports culture
    and social norms around post-exercise celebration. The widespread availability and marketing of beer
    in athletic contexts creates structural conditions promoting alcohol consumption. Understanding that
    low-alcohol options may reduce some harms informs harm reduction approaches.
