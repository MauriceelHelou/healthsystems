- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder during pregnancy creates pattern of prenatal substance exposure'
- 'Step 2: Co-occurring tobacco use (71-95% prevalence in this population) compounds exposure risk'
- 'Step 3: Limited availability of integrated treatment for pregnant women with multiple substance use'
- 'Step 4: Continued polysubstance use throughout pregnancy due to treatment gaps'
- 'Step 5: Elevated rates of combined prenatal alcohol, tobacco, and other substance exposure'

description: Alcohol use disorder during pregnancy is associated with extremely high rates of concurrent
  tobacco use (71-95%), creating multiple simultaneous prenatal substance exposures. The lack of integrated
  treatment approaches for co-occurring substance use in pregnancy perpetuates these combined exposures.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the intersection of multiple structural vulnerabilities.
    Women with alcohol use disorder during pregnancy often face compounded disadvantage including poverty,
    limited healthcare access, and stigma. The fragmented treatment system that separates alcohol from
    tobacco interventions fails to address polysubstance patterns that are the norm rather than exception
    in disadvantaged populations. Structural solutions require integrated, trauma-informed care models
    that address the social determinants underlying substance use patterns.
