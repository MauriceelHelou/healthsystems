direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multicomponent interventions modify food service offerings to reduce availability of high-fat
  foods in school cafeterias'
- 'Step 2: Nutrition education components teach children to identify and limit high-fat food consumption'
- 'Step 3: Environmental changes create structural barriers to accessing high-fat foods during school
  hours'
- 'Step 4: Combined educational and environmental approaches reduce overall fat intake through multiple
  reinforcing pathways'

description: Multicomponent nutritional interventions in schools ranked most effective for reducing fat
  intake among children, with a P score of 0.82 indicating high probability of being the best intervention
  type for this outcome.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 0.82
    type: beta_coefficient
  sample_size: 75954
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Reducing fat intake through environmental modification addresses the food environment
    as a structural determinant of dietary quality. This approach shifts responsibility from individual
    willpower to institutional food policies, potentially benefiting children who lack healthy food options
    at home.
