description: Summer holiday programs showed a non-significant effect on diet quality (g=0.20, 95%CI=-0.43,
  0.83). The wide confidence interval indicates insufficient evidence for a reliable effect on dietary
  quality outcomes.

  equity_implications: The lack of significant effect on diet quality suggests that summer programs may
    need to incorporate more intentional nutrition components to address this aspect of child health.
    For children from food-insecure households, summer programs with meal components could serve as an
    important structural intervention to maintain nutrition when school meals are unavailable.
