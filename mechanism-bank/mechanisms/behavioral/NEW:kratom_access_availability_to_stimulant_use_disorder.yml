  node_id: stimulant_use_disorder
  node_name: Stimulant Use Disorder
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Kratom produces stimulant-like effects at lower doses through adrenergic receptor activity'
- 'Step 2: These effects may serve as a substitute for illicit stimulants'
- 'Step 3: No FDA-approved pharmacotherapies exist for stimulant use disorder, creating treatment gap'
- 'Step 4: Kratom may fill this gap as an unregulated alternative for harm reduction'

description: The absence of approved pharmacotherapies for stimulant use disorder creates a structural
  treatment gap that kratom may partially address through its stimulant-like properties

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The lack of FDA-approved treatments for stimulant use disorder represents a pharmaceutical
    research and regulatory failure, not an individual failing. This structural gap forces individuals
    to seek unregulated alternatives.
