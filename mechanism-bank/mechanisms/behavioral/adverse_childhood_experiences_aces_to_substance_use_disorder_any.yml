mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adverse childhood experiences create early-life trauma and chronic toxic stress'
- 'Step 2: Trauma exposure disrupts development of healthy emotion regulation capacities'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with impaired emotion regulation may use substances as a coping mechanism to manage
  distressing emotions and trauma symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Substance use becomes compulsive, leading to substance use disorder as a maladaptive response
  to unresolved trauma'

description: Adults with ACE histories develop substance use disorders through pathways involving trauma-related
  distress and impaired emotion regulation. The review found no consistent evidence of psychological intervention
  effects on SUD outcomes, with two studies showing small positive effects and two showing small negative
  effects.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The ACE-SUD pathway reflects structural determinants including child welfare system
    failures, poverty, family dysfunction, and community violence. Substance use as coping represents
    a response to structurally-produced trauma rather than individual moral failing. High attrition in
    treatment studies suggests structural barriers to care retention.
