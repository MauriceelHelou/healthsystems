- 'Step 1: Individuals with AsPD frequently present with comorbid substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Comorbid substance use complicates treatment protocols and study recruitment'
- 'Step 3: Research designs recruit participants based on substance abuse rather than AsPD diagnosis'
- 'Step 4: Treatment effectiveness for AsPD specifically cannot be adequately assessed'

description: Across 11 RCTs involving 416 participants, the co-occurrence of substance use disorders with
  AsPD creates fundamental research challenges. No study specifically recruited based on AsPD diagnosis,
  with most participants presenting primarily with substance abuse problems. This structural gap in research
  design prevents understanding of AsPD-specific treatment effects.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The systematic failure to recruit and study AsPD as a primary condition reflects
    broader structural issues in mental health research prioritization and funding. Populations with AsPD
    are often marginalized within healthcare systems, encounter stigma, and face barriers to diagnosis
    and treatment. The high comorbidity with substance use disorders points to shared structural determinants
    including adverse childhood experiences, socioeconomic disadvantage, and limited access to early intervention
    services. Research infrastructure has not adequately addressed these intersecting vulnerabilities.
