mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood sexual abuse causes significant psychological trauma, including
  feelings of shame, guilt, powerlessness, and disrupted emotional development'
- 'Step 2: Survivors develop maladaptive coping strategies to manage trauma-related
  distress, including emotional numbing and avoidance behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol is used as a self-medication strategy to cope with trauma symptoms
  such as anxiety, depression, intrusive memories, and hyperarousal'
- 'Step 4: Repeated alcohol use to manage trauma-related distress leads to neurobiological
  adaptations and increased tolerance'
- 'Step 5: Chronic self-medication patterns progress to alcohol dependence and alcohol
  use disorder'

description: A moderate association exists between childhood sexual abuse and alcohol
  use disorder, with a 45% increased risk among those exposed to CSA. This relationship
  operates through trauma-related psychological distress leading to self-medication
  with alcohol as a maladaptive coping strategy. The burden of proof analysis indicates
  this is one of the more robust associations between CSA and health outcomes.
