direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Caffeine acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist, blocking the accumulation
  of sleep-promoting adenosine in the brain'
- 'Step 2: This pharmacological action increases alertness and delays sleep onset,
  particularly problematic given adolescents'' naturally delayed circadian phase'
- 'Step 3: Caffeine''s half-life of 3-5 hours means consumption even in afternoon
  hours can interfere with nighttime sleep initiation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic caffeine use leads to tolerance and dependence, creating a cycle
  where poor sleep drives increased caffeine consumption, further exacerbating sleep
  problems'
