direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ethyl alcohol intoxication impairs pedestrian judgment, coordination, and reaction time'
- 'Step 2: Impaired pedestrians are more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as crossing against
  traffic signals or walking in traffic lanes'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-impaired pedestrians have reduced ability to perceive and avoid oncoming vehicles'
- 'Step 4: Traffic crashes involving intoxicated pedestrians result in higher rates of on-scene fatalities
  (78.95% vs lower rates for sober pedestrians)'

description: The majority of fatal pedestrian victims (72.15%) were under the influence of ethyl alcohol
  at time of crash. Intoxicated pedestrians more frequently died at the scene (78.95%), though alcohol
  was not found to be an independent factor affecting injury severity. The study analyzed 158 fatal pedestrian
  victims hit by passenger cars over 2009-2013 in Warsaw.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While this study focuses on individual alcohol use, structural factors that should
    be considered include: availability and density of alcohol outlets, pedestrian infrastructure design,
    street lighting in areas with high alcohol consumption venues, public transportation access as alternative
    to walking while intoxicated, and rural vs urban differences in emergency medical response times and
    trauma care access. The gender and age disparities suggest differential vulnerability that may relate
    to structural factors around alcohol marketing, social norms, and urban planning.'
