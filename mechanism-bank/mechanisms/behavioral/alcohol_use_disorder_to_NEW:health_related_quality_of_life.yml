- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder causes physical health deterioration (liver damage, cardiovascular effects,
  neurological impairment)'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol use impairs social relationships and occupational functioning'
- 'Step 3: Withdrawal and craving states create psychological distress'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related stigma and social exclusion compound psychosocial impacts'
- 'Step 5: Multiple domain impairments aggregate into reduced overall quality of life'

description: The systematic review identified alcohol-specific quality of life instruments (AQoLS, ALQoL-9)
  among the 53 instruments evaluated. These instruments showed promising internal consistency (Cronbach's
  alpha > 0.70), suggesting they reliably measure QoL impacts in alcohol use disorder populations. However,
  the review notes insufficient high-quality validation evidence to confidently assess reliability and
  validity of QoL measurement in addiction-related risk and harm populations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol use disorder impacts on QoL operate through structural pathways including
    healthcare system barriers to treatment access, economic impacts of alcohol-related job loss, housing
    instability, and criminal justice involvement. Communities with higher alcohol outlet density and
    fewer treatment resources face compounded structural barriers. The review highlights measurement limitations
    that may obscure the full extent of alcohol-related QoL impacts, particularly in underserved populations
    where validated instruments may not have been tested.
