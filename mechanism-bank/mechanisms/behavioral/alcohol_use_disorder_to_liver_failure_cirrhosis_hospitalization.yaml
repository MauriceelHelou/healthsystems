direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in AUD leads to direct hepatotoxicity through
  ethanol metabolism, generating acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species that cause
  oxidative stress and hepatocyte damage'
- 'Step 2: Sustained alcohol exposure triggers abnormal lipid metabolism (steatosis),
  endoplasmic reticulum stress, and multiple forms of cell death including apoptosis,
  necroptosis, and ferroptosis'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol disrupts intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis), increasing gut permeability
  and allowing bacterial endotoxins to reach the liver, activating hepatic immune
  responses and inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation leads to progressive hepatic fibrosis as stellate
  cells are activated and deposit excessive collagen in liver tissue'
- 'Step 5: Continued alcohol exposure accelerates fibrosis to cirrhosis; in patients
  with co-existing conditions like HCV, AUD synergistically worsens disease progression
  to decompensated cirrhosis with complications including ascites, variceal bleeding,
  and hepatic encephalopathy'

description: Alcohol Use Disorder substantially increases the risk of progression
  to decompensated liver cirrhosis through multiple interconnected pathways. The meta-analysis
  of 11 studies (n=286,641) found that AUD diagnosis was associated with a 3.3-fold
  increased risk of decompensated cirrhosis in HCV-infected individuals, with approximately
  35-39% of cases attributable to AUD. The pathogenic mechanisms include direct hepatotoxicity
  from ethanol metabolites, oxidative stress, abnormal lipid metabolism, endoplasmic
  reticulum stress, multiple forms of programmed cell death, intestinal microbiota
  dysbiosis leading to increased gut permeability, and chronic hepatic inflammation
  resulting in progressive fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis.
