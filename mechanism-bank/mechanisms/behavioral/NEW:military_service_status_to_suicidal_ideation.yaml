  node_id: suicidal_ideation
  node_name: Suicidal Ideation
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Military service exposes individuals to unique stressors including combat
  exposure, trauma, separation from family, and high-pressure operational environments'
- 'Step 2: These occupational stressors contribute to elevated rates of psychological
  distress, depression (23% in active military, 20% in veterans), and mental health
  challenges'
- 'Step 3: The combination of trauma exposure, depression, and potential barriers
  to seeking mental health care (stigma, access issues) leads to elevated suicidal
  ideation with 11% pooled prevalence in military populations'
- 'Step 4: Co-occurring substance use further amplifies risk, with suicidal ideation
  reaching 18% in drug-using military personnel and 9% in those consuming alcohol'

description: Military service, whether active duty or veteran status, is associated
  with an 11% prevalence of suicidal ideation based on a global meta-analysis of cross-sectional
  studies. This elevated risk is mediated through high rates of depression (20-23%),
  exposure to combat trauma, and occupational stressors unique to military environments.
  The relationship is substantially stronger among those with co-occurring substance
  use disorders.
