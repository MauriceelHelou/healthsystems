- 'Step 1: Alcohol brands deploy targeted digital marketing across social media, streaming platforms,
  and mobile applications'
- 'Step 2: Self-reported exposure to this content occurs through active engagement or passive algorithmic
  delivery'
- 'Step 3: Marketing content creates and reinforces pro-alcohol attitudes and drinking intentions'
- 'Step 4: Perceived social norms around alcohol use are shifted toward acceptance of regular drinking'
- 'Step 5: Increased likelihood of initiating or sustaining alcohol use within past 30 days'

  reporting past 30-day alcohol use compared to those not exposed. This finding from 19 studies with 46,361
  participants demonstrates how digital marketing environments influence recent drinking behavior.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights commercial determinants of health operating through digital
    infrastructure. The alcohol industry's marketing practices, enabled by digital platform design and
    inadequate regulatory oversight, create an obesogenic-like environment for alcohol consumption. Youth
    are disproportionately affected due to their digital media engagement patterns and developmental vulnerability.
    Structural interventions should address marketing regulation, platform accountability, and age verification
    systems rather than focusing on individual willpower.
