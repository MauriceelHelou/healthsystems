  node_id: all_cause_mortality_rate
  node_name: All-Cause Mortality Rate
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Females have different alcohol metabolism due to lower body water content and different enzyme
  activity'
- 'Step 2: Same alcohol doses produce higher blood alcohol concentrations and greater tissue exposure
  in females'
- 'Step 3: Early initiation during adolescence may have greater impact on female physiology'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative alcohol-related damage is accelerated, leading to substantially elevated mortality
  risk'

description: Female drinkers who initiated alcohol before age 19 had double the mortality risk (102% increase)
  compared to female lifetime abstainers, indicating significantly stronger effects in women than the
  overall population

  equity_implications: This sex-stratified finding highlights the need for gender-responsive alcohol policy.
    Structural factors including changing gender norms around alcohol consumption, targeted marketing
    to women, and lack of sex-specific prevention messaging contribute to this disparity. Public health
    interventions should address the differential vulnerability of women to early alcohol initiation effects.
