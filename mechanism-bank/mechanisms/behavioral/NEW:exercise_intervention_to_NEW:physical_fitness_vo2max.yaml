direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structured exercise interventions (aerobic, yoga, or mixed types) are implemented
  as part of treatment programs'
- 'Step 2: Regular physical activity stimulates cardiovascular adaptations including
  increased stroke volume and cardiac output'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced oxygen delivery and utilization capacity leads to measurable improvements
  in VO2 max (maximal oxygen uptake)'

description: 'Exercise interventions significantly improve physical fitness as measured
  by VO2 max in individuals with alcohol use disorders. Meta-analysis demonstrated
  a moderate positive effect (SMD: 0.487) of exercise on maximal oxygen uptake, indicating
  meaningful improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness through structured physical
  activity programs.'
