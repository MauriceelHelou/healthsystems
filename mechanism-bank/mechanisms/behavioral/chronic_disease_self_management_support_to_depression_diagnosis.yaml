mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Self-management interventions provide structured education and skills training
  to individuals with chronic physical diseases, teaching decision-making and action-taking
  skills for managing their conditions'
- 'Step 2: Participants develop enhanced self-efficacy and perceived control over
  their health condition, reducing feelings of helplessness and hopelessness that
  contribute to depressive symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Active engagement in health behaviors (medication adherence, lifestyle
  modifications, symptom monitoring) improves physiological outcomes like glycemic
  control, reducing disease burden'
- 'Step 4: Improved disease management and self-efficacy lead to reduced psychological
  distress and depressive symptomatology, with sustained effects over 6+ months'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in depressive symptoms decreases the likelihood of meeting clinical
  thresholds for depression diagnosis'

description: Self-management interventions for chronic physical diseases significantly
  reduce depressive symptoms through building self-efficacy, decision-making capacity,
  and action-taking skills. Two large meta-analyses comprising 49 studies and over
  9,600 participants demonstrate consistent moderate-to-large negative effects on
  depression, with pooled effect sizes ranging from SMD -0.15 to -0.53. These interventions
  work by empowering patients to actively manage their conditions, improving both
  psychological and physiological outcomes, thereby reducing the psychological burden
  that contributes to clinical depression.
