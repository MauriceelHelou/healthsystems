mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor sleep quality reduces glymphatic system function during sleep'
- 'Step 2: Impaired glymphatic clearance decreases removal of metabolic waste including amyloid-beta'
- 'Step 3: Chronic sleep disruption leads to cumulative amyloid accumulation'
- 'Step 4: Progressive amyloid deposition creates pathological burden associated with neurodegeneration'

description: Sleep quality is associated with cerebral amyloid pathology, with poor sleep potentially
  impairing the brain's natural amyloid clearance mechanisms during rest.

moderators:
- name: cognitive_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Study examined both NC and MCI populations, suggesting cognitive status may moderate this
    relationship
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Sleep quality is structurally determined by housing conditions (noise, crowding),
    shift work requirements, neighborhood safety, and economic stress. Policies addressing housing quality,
    work schedule regulations, and noise ordinances represent upstream interventions.
