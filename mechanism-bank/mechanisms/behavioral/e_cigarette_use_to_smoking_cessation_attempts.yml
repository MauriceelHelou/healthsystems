mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes provides alternative nicotine delivery
  system'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine from e-cigarettes reduces withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with tobacco
  cessation'
- 'Step 3: Behavioral component of vaping substitutes for hand-to-mouth ritual of smoking'
- 'Step 4: Sustained e-cigarette use facilitates transition away from combustible tobacco'
- 'Step 5: Long-term abstinence from smoking achieved at higher rates compared to other cessation methods'

description: High-certainty evidence that nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes increase smoking quit
  rates by 59% compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This represents a structural intervention
  that modifies the availability and accessibility of harm-reduction tools for tobacco cessation.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism relates to healthcare policy and regulatory frameworks that determine
    access to smoking cessation tools. Structural factors include: regulation of e-cigarette products,
    healthcare provider recommendations, insurance coverage for cessation aids, and public health messaging.
    Equity implications involve differential access to regulated products based on socioeconomic status
    and geographic location. Low-income populations may have limited access to regulated products and
    cessation support services.'
