direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior suicide attempt establishes a behavioral pattern and demonstrates
  capacity for self-directed lethal behavior, lowering psychological barriers to future
  attempts'
- 'Step 2: Neurobiological and psychological changes from prior attempt (e.g., acquired
  capability for suicide, habituation to fear of death) increase vulnerability to
  lethal means during subsequent crises'
- 'Step 3: Prior attempt serves as strongest behavioral predictor of future suicidal
  behavior, with each subsequent attempt potentially escalating in lethality until
  death by suicide occurs'

description: 'Prior suicide attempt is a moderately strong predictor of subsequent
  death by suicide (OR=4.09, 95% CI: 3.05-5.49). This behavioral marker represents
  both a direct risk factor and an indicator of underlying vulnerability. Meta-analytic
  evidence from 51 studies confirms this association is robust across settings and
  diagnostic categories. Machine learning studies in psychiatric populations consistently
  identify previous attempts as one of the most important predictive features for
  suicide outcomes, with prediction models incorporating prior attempts typically
  achieving 70% or greater accuracy.'
