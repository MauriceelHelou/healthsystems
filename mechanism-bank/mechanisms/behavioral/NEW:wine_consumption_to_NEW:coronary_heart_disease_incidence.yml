mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Wine consumption introduces bioactive compounds including polyphenols and antioxidants'
- 'Step 2: These compounds reduce oxidative modification of LDL cholesterol, a key step in atherogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Anti-thrombotic effects reduce platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in coronary arteries'
- 'Step 4: Vasodilatory effects improve coronary blood flow and reduce myocardial ischemia risk'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects result in reduced coronary heart disease incidence'

description: 'The strongest protective association was observed for coronary heart disease (RR=0.76, 95%
  CI: 0.69-0.84). This represents a 24% risk reduction associated with wine consumption compared to non-consumption
  or lower consumption categories. The effect showed robustness across different demographic subgroups
  analyzed.'

  equity_implications: 'This finding must be interpreted within structural contexts: (1) Access to wine
    is shaped by economic resources, neighborhood alcohol retail environment, and cultural factors; (2)
    The ''sick quitter'' phenomenon may bias estimates if former drinkers with poor health are categorized
    as non-drinkers; (3) Vulnerable populations including those with alcohol use disorder, certain medications,
    liver disease, or pregnancy may experience net harm from any alcohol consumption; (4) Structural interventions
    should focus on addressing cardiovascular disease through proven methods (tobacco control, food environment,
    healthcare access) rather than promoting alcohol consumption; (5) Marketing of potential health benefits
    could disproportionately harm communities already experiencing alcohol-related health disparities.'
