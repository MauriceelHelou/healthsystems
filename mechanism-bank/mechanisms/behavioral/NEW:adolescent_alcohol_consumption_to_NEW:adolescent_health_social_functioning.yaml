mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adolescents initiate alcohol consumption, with prevalence increasing steadily
  from age 12 reaching 89.5% by age 17'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption leads to immediate health risks including accidents,
  injuries, self-harm, poisoning, and accidental death'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol use impairs judgment leading to risky behaviors such as unprotected
  or regretted sex, violence, and disorder'
- 'Step 4: Earlier onset of drinking compounds negative effects on health and social
  functioning outcomes'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative alcohol exposure during adolescent development results in measurable
  deficits in overall health and social functioning'

description: Adolescent alcohol consumption is negatively associated with health and
  social functioning through multiple pathways. The prevalence study of 5,376 adolescents
  in emergency departments found significant associations between alcohol consumption
  and earlier onset of drinking with poorer health and social functioning outcomes.
  Excessive drinking in adolescents is linked to increased risk of accidents, injuries,
  self-harm, unprotected or regretted sex, violence and disorder, poisoning, and accidental
  death. UK adolescents are among the heaviest drinkers in Europe, with 39.5% reporting
  lifetime alcohol use and 15% meeting criteria for at-risk drinking.
