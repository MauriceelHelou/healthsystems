category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption influences lipid metabolism and may improve HDL cholesterol levels'
- 'Step 2: Potential anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects at moderate doses'
- 'Step 3: Preserved vascular function and reduced oxidative stress at moderate intake levels'
- 'Step 4: Lower atherosclerotic burden in peripheral arterial circulation'

description: Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a 19% reduced risk of PAD compared to non/never
  drinkers (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.90). The U-shaped relationship indicates optimal cardiovascular protection
  at lower consumption levels.

  description: Protection strongest at lower consumption levels; benefits attenuate and reverse as consumption
    approaches heavy drinking threshold
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The U-shaped relationship between alcohol and PAD reflects complex biological dose-response
    dynamics. Policy implications must balance potential cardiovascular benefits against known harms of
    alcohol including addiction, liver disease, and social harms. Structural interventions should focus
    on harm reduction rather than promoting consumption.
