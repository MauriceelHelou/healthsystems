direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Specific dietary patterns in Sub-Saharan Africa expose populations to carcinogenic
  compounds or create nutrient deficiencies'
- 'Step 2: Dietary exposures interact with biological pathways to promote cellular
  transformation and tumor development'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated dietary risk factors contribute to cancer development, particularly
  esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancers'

    that could modify diet-cancer relationships

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Multivitamin supplementation may buffer against dietary carcinogenic
    exposures but was not adequately measured

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Body composition interacts with dietary intake to influence cancer
    risk but was inadequately assessed

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Physical activity may modify dietary cancer risk but was not consistently
    measured as a confounder

  description: Tobacco use interacts with dietary factors in carcinogenesis but was
    not adequately controlled in most studies
- name: alcohol_consumption
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Alcohol consumption synergistically increases cancer risk with dietary
    factors but was inadequately measured as a confounder in most studies
