category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recorded alcohol sales serve as a proxy measure for legal alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 2: Reductions in recorded sales indicate decreased population-level purchasing of alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Lower purchasing translates to reduced availability and consumption of alcohol in households'
- 'Step 4: Population-level consumption decreases, though some substitution to unrecorded sources may
  occur'

description: The study suggests that reduced recorded alcohol sales reflect a protective effect by reducing
  total alcohol consumption at the population level. However, the authors note uncertainty due to possible
  effects of unrecorded alcohol consumption, indicating that the relationship between sales data and actual
  consumption is not perfectly direct.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Relationship between recorded sales and total consumption varies by country based on
    availability of unrecorded alcohol sources, cross-border shopping, and informal production

  description: Greater availability of unrecorded alcohol may lead to substitution effects, weakening
    the relationship between recorded sales and actual consumption
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how market-level measures (recorded sales) can serve
    as indicators of population health behaviors. The acknowledgment of unrecorded consumption reflects
    understanding of how regulatory environments may shift rather than eliminate harmful behaviors, particularly
    for populations with access to alternative alcohol sources.
