mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher baseline PTSD severity indicates more entrenched trauma memory networks'
- 'Step 2: Greater symptom burden may exceed standard treatment dose capacity'
- 'Step 3: Severe symptoms interfere with engagement in exposure-based components'
- 'Step 4: Incomplete fear extinction leads to residual symptoms meeting PTSD criteria post-treatment'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined baseline factors predicting response to
  trauma-focused psychotherapy, with baseline symptom severity being a typical predictor examined. Up
  to half of PTSD patients do not respond to trauma-focused treatment, necessitating identification of
  predictors to improve outcomes.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: PTSD severity at treatment entry is influenced by structural factors including
    delayed access to care due to healthcare deserts, insurance barriers, and stigma. Populations facing
    structural barriers to early intervention present with more severe symptoms. Treatment non-response
    rates highlight healthcare system inadequacy in serving those with greatest need.
