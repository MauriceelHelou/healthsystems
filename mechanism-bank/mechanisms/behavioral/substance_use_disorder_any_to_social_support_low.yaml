direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorders lead to behavioral patterns (e.g., unpredictability,
  prioritizing substance use) that strain existing social relationships'
- 'Step 2: Social network members may distance themselves due to conflict, mistrust,
  or enabling concerns, leading to network erosion'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with SUDs may have impaired social functioning that limits
  their ability to maintain or develop supportive relationships'
- 'Step 4: Even after housing interventions, individuals with SUDs require additional
  social functioning support to rebuild networks, indicating persistent deficits in
  social support'

description: This systematic review of 29 studies found substantial evidence that
  individuals with substance use disorders experience greater challenges in maintaining
  social support networks. Among chronically homeless populations, those with SUDs
  require additional social functioning support even after receiving housing, indicating
  that substance use creates persistent barriers to developing and maintaining supportive
  relationships. The review found wide variability in social support measurement but
  consistent patterns showing SUD as a risk factor for inadequate social support.
