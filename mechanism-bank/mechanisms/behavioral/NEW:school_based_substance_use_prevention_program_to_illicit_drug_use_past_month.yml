- 'Step 1: School-based prevention program provides comprehensive education about substance dangers including
  cannabis'
- 'Step 2: Social-influence approach develops adolescent resistance skills and normative education'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced protective factors and knowledge reduce cannabis experimentation'
- 'Step 4: Significant reduction in lifetime and 30-day cannabis use prevalence among intervention students'

description: The YSLQQ intervention resulted in significant reduction in lifetime and 30-day prevalence
  of cannabis use among intervention students compared to control group. The 12-hour curriculum targeting
  6th-8th graders in public schools demonstrated effectiveness in reducing early adolescent cannabis use.

  variation_notes: Cultural adaptation from European to Chilean context; cannabis use patterns and social
    norms may differ across settings affecting mechanism strength

  description: Program targeted 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students (early adolescence), which may be optimal
    timing for prevention before substance use initiation
- name: student_engagement
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: 49.6% of students liked the sessions and 62.9% reported being happy or very happy with
    the program; higher engagement likely improves outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The mechanism operates through structural educational infrastructure rather than
    individual-level interventions. By embedding prevention in public school systems, the program creates
    population-level exposure to protective factors. This addresses equity by providing evidence-based
    prevention to all students regardless of family socioeconomic resources. The focus on social-influence
    approach acknowledges that substance use is shaped by environmental and peer factors rather than individual
    moral failings.
