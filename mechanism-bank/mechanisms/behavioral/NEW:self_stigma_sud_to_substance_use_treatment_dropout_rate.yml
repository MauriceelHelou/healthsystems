direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals internalize societal negative stereotypes about people with substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Internalized stigma leads to self-devaluation, shame, and reduced sense of worth'
- 'Step 3: Self-stigma diminishes beliefs in capacity for recovery and treatment effectiveness'
- 'Step 4: Reduced self-efficacy and hopelessness undermine treatment engagement and persistence'
- 'Step 5: Treatment dropout or reduced adherence results from these internalized barriers'

description: Self-stigma (internalized stigma) operates as a distinct but related mechanism to perceived
  social stigma in affecting SUD treatment outcomes. The review found that self-stigma operates primarily
  through cognitive mechanisms including self-efficacy and negative self-beliefs. The relationship appears
  to be indirect rather than direct, with emotional and cognitive mediators playing key roles.

  description: Self-efficacy serves as a key cognitive mechanism; higher baseline self-efficacy may protect
    against self-stigma effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Self-stigma represents the internalization of structural stigma - it is not an
    individual failing but rather the psychological consequence of living in a stigmatizing society. Structural
    interventions that reduce public stigma through education, contact-based approaches, and policy change
    (e.g., decriminalization, parity laws) would reduce the source of internalized stigma. The review's
    framing appropriately recognizes that self-stigma originates from societal attitudes rather than individual
    pathology.
