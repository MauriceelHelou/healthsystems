mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) experiencing homelessness
  enroll in managed alcohol programs (MAPs) that provide regular, controlled doses
  of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Regulated alcohol administration reduces consumption of non-beverage alcohol
  (e.g., mouthwash, hand sanitizer) and prevents dangerous binge drinking episodes'
- 'Step 3: Structured program environment provides concurrent access to housing, healthcare
  services, and social supports that address co-occurring health conditions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced exposure to hazardous drinking patterns and improved access to
  medical care decreases risk of acute alcohol poisoning, withdrawal seizures, and
  other alcohol-induced fatal events'
- 'Step 5: Stabilized living conditions and harm reduction approach lead to decreased
  alcohol-induced mortality among program participants'

description: Managed alcohol programs (MAPs) are harm reduction interventions that
  provide regular, controlled doses of alcohol to individuals with severe alcohol
  use disorder experiencing homelessness. By regulating alcohol consumption and providing
  structured support including housing and social services, MAPs reduce dangerous
  drinking patterns (including consumption of non-beverage alcohol), prevent acute
  alcohol toxicity events, and improve access to healthcare, thereby decreasing alcohol-induced
  mortality.
