mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals who are former drinkers often stopped drinking due to health
  problems, alcohol-related illnesses, or medical advice, creating a ''sick quitter''
  effect'
- 'Step 2: These pre-existing health conditions that prompted cessation of drinking
  continue to affect health outcomes and increase mortality risk'
- 'Step 3: When former drinkers are included in ''abstainer'' reference groups, they
  artificially inflate mortality rates in that category, creating a spurious protective
  effect for moderate drinkers'
- 'Step 4: The elevated mortality risk among former drinkers (RR = 1.22) reflects
  the accumulated health burden from previous drinking and/or the conditions that
  led to drinking cessation'

description: Former drinkers have a 22% elevated mortality risk compared to other
  drinking categories. This elevated risk is attributed to the 'sick quitter' phenomenon,
  where individuals stop drinking due to existing health problems. This finding is
  critical for understanding the apparent J-shaped relationship between alcohol and
  mortality, as misclassifying former drinkers as abstainers biases the reference
  group toward ill health.
