direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural factors including weak alcohol sales regulations to minors increase youth access'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents (ages 10-17) are exposed to alcohol with 23.3% lifetime prevalence'
- 'Step 3: Early alcohol initiation leads to regular use patterns (36.2% past year, 11.3% past 6 months)'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol dependence develops in 4.1% of adolescents, representing significant youth burden'

description: 'Among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, alcohol dependence prevalence was 4.1% (CI: 1.4-7.9%).
  The authors conclude that ''the prevalence of alcohol use disorder is common among adolescents in sub-Saharan
  Africa,'' highlighting this as a major public health concern requiring structural intervention.'

  description: Country-specific regulatory and cultural environments dramatically affect adolescent alcohol
    exposure, with Zambia showing extremely high rates
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The high prevalence of alcohol use disorder among adolescents reflects structural
    failures in youth protection policies. The conclusion that AUD is 'common among adolescents' signals
    need for structural interventions including minimum age enforcement, advertising restrictions, and
    school-based prevention. Wide variation by country suggests policy environment is a key determinant.
    This is not an individual behavioral failing but a structural public health crisis.
