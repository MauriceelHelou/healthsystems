- 'Step 1: Children spend time using smartphones and tablets'
- 'Step 2: Screen time displaces opportunities for active play and movement'
- 'Step 3: Sedentary entertainment reduces motivation for physical activity'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative displacement leads to insufficient physical activity levels'

description: Children with shorter smartphone and tablet usage were 1.19 times more likely to be physically
  active (OR = 1.19; 95%CI = 1.03-1.37). This inverse association suggests device use competes with physical
  activity, though the effect size is smaller than for sleep outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Physical activity in children is constrained by built environment factors including
    park access, sidewalk availability, neighborhood safety, and school recess policies. Device use may
    be a response to inadequate safe spaces for active play, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods.
    Interventions must address both screen time and structural barriers to physical activity to avoid
    placing blame on families without resources for alternatives.
