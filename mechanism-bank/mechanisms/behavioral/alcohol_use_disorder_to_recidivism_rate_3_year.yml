mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder impairs impulse control and decision-making through neurological effects
  on prefrontal cortex'
- 'Step 2: Impaired judgment increases likelihood of engaging in risk-taking and antisocial behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Active alcohol use may lead to situations involving illegal activities (theft, assault, public
  disorder)'
- 'Step 4: Untreated alcohol use disorder in juvenile justice population perpetuates cycle of criminal
  behavior and re-arrest'

description: Among Korean adolescents on probation or parole, alcohol use disorder was significantly associated
  with repeated criminal offenses, while other psychiatric disorders were not. This suggests that alcohol
  use disorder represents a unique and modifiable risk factor for juvenile recidivism that warrants targeted
  intervention.

  description: Other psychiatric disorders (bipolar, ASPD, ADHD) were not independently associated with
    recidivism, suggesting alcohol use disorder has unique pathway to repeat offenses
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the structural failure of juvenile justice systems to
    adequately screen for and treat alcohol use disorders among young offenders. The high prevalence of
    AUD (19.17%) among this population reflects broader structural issues including inadequate adolescent
    substance use treatment capacity, lack of integration between juvenile justice and behavioral health
    systems, and insufficient diversion programs. Addressing this requires systemic changes including
    mandated screening, treatment accessibility within probation/parole systems, and policy reforms that
    treat adolescent substance use as a health issue rather than solely a criminal one.
