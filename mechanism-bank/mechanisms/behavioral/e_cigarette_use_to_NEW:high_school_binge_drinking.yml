mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: E-cigarette use during high school years signals engagement in risk behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Social environments promoting e-cigarette use in this age group often include alcohol availability'
- 'Step 3: Peer influence effects are particularly strong during high school developmental period'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological effects of nicotine may enhance alcohol reward sensitivity'
- 'Step 5: Progression to harmful drinking patterns (binge drinking/drunkenness) occurs'

description: High school e-cigarette users had nearly 8-fold increased odds of binge drinking/drunkenness
  compared to non-users, indicating that the association between e-cigarettes and hazardous drinking patterns
  is particularly strong in this age group.

  equity_implications: This finding supports policy recommendations to couple e-cigarette reduction interventions
    with alcohol prevention measures, particularly in high school settings. Structural approaches should
    address both product availability, marketing exposure, and comprehensive school health policies. The
    magnitude of association underscores the public health urgency of addressing co-use patterns through
    environmental and policy interventions rather than individual-level approaches alone.
