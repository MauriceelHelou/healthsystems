to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ED patients are universally screened for risky alcohol use using validated
  instruments by trained bilingual/bicultural Health Educators'
- 'Step 2: Patients screening positive receive brief motivational interventions matched
  to their risk level during a ''teachable moment'' when they may be more receptive
  to behavior change messaging'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention techniques enhance motivation to change and provide
  strategies to reduce alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Patients modify drinking behaviors, resulting in reduced prevalence and
  frequency of binge drinking at 6-month follow-up'

description: SBIRT interventions delivered in emergency departments reduce binge drinking
  through opportunistic screening and brief motivational interventions. The ED setting
  provides a 'teachable moment' where patients may be more open to feedback about
  risky drinking behaviors. Trained Health Educators deliver interventions matched
  to patient risk level, resulting in modest but statistically significant reductions
  in both prevalence and frequency of binge drinking at 6-month follow-up.
