direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) consume no/low alcohol (NoLo) drinks'
- 'Step 2: Sensory cues (taste, smell, appearance) of NoLo drinks mimic alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related cues trigger conditioned physiological responses in individuals with AUD'
- 'Step 4: Craving and desire to drink increase following NoLo drink consumption'
- 'Step 5: Severity of alcohol dependence correlates with magnitude of craving response'

description: Consumption of no/low alcohol drinks in individuals with alcohol use disorder triggers increased
  craving and desire to drink through alcohol-related sensory cues that activate conditioned responses.
  This effect is moderated by severity of alcohol dependence.

  description: The increase in craving correlates with the severity of alcohol dependence - more severe
    AUD leads to stronger craving response to NoLo drinks
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how environmental factors (marketing and availability
    of NoLo drinks as harm reduction tools) may have unintended consequences for vulnerable populations
    with AUD. Policy implications include the need for targeted clinical guidance and potentially differentiated
    marketing/availability strategies for populations with AUD versus general population. The mechanism
    avoids individual blame by focusing on conditioned physiological responses rather than willpower.
