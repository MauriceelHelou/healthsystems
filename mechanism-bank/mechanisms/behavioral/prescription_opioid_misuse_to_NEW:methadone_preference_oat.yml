  node_name: Preference for Methadone as OAT
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-prescribed pharmaceutical opioid use indicates ongoing opioid dependence patterns'
- 'Step 2: Users of pharmaceutical opioids may have developed specific tolerance profiles'
- 'Step 3: Full agonist therapy (methadone) may better match pharmacological needs of those using pharmaceutical
  opioids'
- 'Step 4: Treatment preference reflects experienced need for more robust opioid agonist coverage'

description: Non-prescribed pharmaceutical opioid use was associated with over 2-fold increased odds of
  preferring methadone over buprenorphine for OAT.

  equity_implications: The association between pharmaceutical opioid misuse and methadone preference reflects
    the broader structural issue of prescription opioid availability and subsequent dependence pathways.
    Treatment systems must accommodate diverse pathways into opioid dependence.
