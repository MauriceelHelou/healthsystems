direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Trauma-focused psychotherapy addresses underlying PTSD symptoms that often
  co-occur with and drive alcohol use as a self-medication strategy'
- 'Step 2: AOD medication (e.g., naltrexone, acamprosate) directly targets neurobiological
  pathways involved in alcohol craving and reward, reducing physiological drive to
  drink'
- 'Step 3: The combined approach simultaneously treats both the psychological trauma
  triggers and the pharmacological dependency mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Integrated treatment prevents the cycle where untreated PTSD symptoms lead
  to relapse, while medication supports abstinence during psychological processing'
- 'Step 5: Synergistic effects result in significantly greater reduction in alcohol
  use severity compared to either treatment modality alone or placebo conditions'

description: Combined trauma-focused psychotherapy with AOD medication demonstrates
  superior efficacy in reducing alcohol use severity compared to single-modality treatments
  or placebo. The network meta-analysis of 24 RCTs found large effect sizes (SMD =
  -0.81 vs placebo medication conditions), indicating that addressing both PTSD symptoms
  through psychotherapy and alcohol craving/reward mechanisms through medication produces
  synergistic benefits for individuals with comorbid PTSD and alcohol use disorder.
