mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol consumption causes direct hepatotoxic effects'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure triggers inflammatory cascade in liver tissue'
- 'Step 3: Persistent inflammation leads to hepatocyte damage and fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis advances through disease spectrum from steatosis to cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: Advanced disease may progress to alcohol-associated hepatitis and liver failure'

description: Heavy alcohol consumption directly causes progressive liver damage through toxic and inflammatory
  mechanisms, leading to the full spectrum of alcohol-associated liver disease.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While alcohol exposure is proximate cause, structural determinants shape drinking
    patterns including alcohol availability, marketing, economic stress, and social conditions. Focus
    should be on environmental factors that promote heavy drinking rather than individual consumption
    choices alone.
