  description: Adolescent and young adult populations may be particularly vulnerable due to developmental
    factors
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Structural factors include inadequate integration of alcohol prevention with sexual
    health education, limited access to condoms in settings where drinking occurs, and social norms that
    link alcohol use with sexual activity. Community-level interventions addressing both alcohol availability
    and reproductive health access are needed. Equity considerations include differential access to comprehensive
    health education and harm reduction resources.
