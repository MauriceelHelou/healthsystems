category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater use of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) leads to moderated drinking behaviors'
- 'Step 2: PBS such as limiting drinks, pacing consumption, and avoiding high-risk drinking contexts reduce
  peak blood alcohol concentration'
- 'Step 3: Lower intoxication levels decrease acute alcohol-related harms (injuries, blackouts, regretted
  behaviors)'
- 'Step 4: Sustained PBS use reduces accumulation of alcohol-related problems over time'

description: Increased use of protective behavioral strategies among college students reduces alcohol-related
  problems by moderating drinking patterns and reducing exposure to high-risk drinking situations.

  sample_size: 3691
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While PBS reflects individual behavior, the pathway emphasizes that structural
    interventions (BMIs delivered through healthcare or educational systems) are necessary to promote
    PBS adoption. The focus is on system-level intervention delivery rather than individual responsibility
    alone.
