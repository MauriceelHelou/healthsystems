description: School-based nutrition education ranked as the most effective intervention for reducing BMI
  z-score in children, with a P score of 0.99 indicating it was almost certainly the best-ranked intervention
  for this age-standardized weight outcome.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 0.99
    type: beta_coefficient
  sample_size: 75954
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: BMI z-score is an age- and sex-standardized measure appropriate for growing children.
    School-based delivery ensures equitable access to nutrition education across socioeconomic groups,
    though effectiveness may vary based on school resources and implementation fidelity.
