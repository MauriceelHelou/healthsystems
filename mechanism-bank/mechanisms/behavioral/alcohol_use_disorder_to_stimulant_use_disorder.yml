mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ethanol self-administration prior to cocaine availability alters neurobiological reward pathways'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol increases the reinforcing strength of cocaine, requiring longer delays to shift behavior
  away from cocaine'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced cocaine reinforcement diminishes effectiveness of behavioral interventions offering
  non-drug alternatives'
- 'Step 4: Polysubstance use pattern leads to poorer treatment outcomes for cocaine use disorder'

description: Ethanol self-administration (1.5g/kg) prior to cocaine availability increased the reinforcing
  strength of cocaine in a choice paradigm, requiring longer delays added to cocaine to decrease cocaine
  choice compared to vehicle control. This suggests alcohol co-use diminishes the effectiveness of interventions
  designed to shift behavior toward non-drug alternatives.

  equity_implications: This preclinical study has implications for understanding polysubstance use treatment
    barriers. The finding that alcohol enhances cocaine reinforcement suggests that treatment programs
    addressing cocaine use disorder must also address co-occurring alcohol use. Structural factors influencing
    alcohol availability and normalization may indirectly worsen cocaine treatment outcomes. The study
    avoids individual blame by demonstrating a neurobiological mechanism whereby concurrent substance
    exposure alters drug reinforcement. Equity implications include that populations with higher rates
    of polysubstance use may face compounded treatment challenges, and treatment systems need to be designed
    to address multiple substances simultaneously.
