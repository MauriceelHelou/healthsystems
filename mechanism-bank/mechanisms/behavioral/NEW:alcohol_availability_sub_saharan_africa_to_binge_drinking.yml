direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol availability and cultural norms influence drinking patterns at population level'
- 'Step 2: Lifetime alcohol use prevalence reaches 34.9% among adults and 23.3% among adolescents'
- 'Step 3: High-risk alcohol use patterns emerge including binge drinking behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Past 6-month alcohol use of 32.2% among adults and 11.3% among adolescents indicates current
  active use'

description: 'The meta-analysis found lifetime prevalence of alcohol use was 34.9% (CI: 17.7-54.1%) among
  adults and 23.3% (CI: 11.3-37.1%) among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa. Past year prevalence was
  27.1% (CI: 5.0-56.4%) for adults and 36.2% (CI: 18.4-56.1%) for adolescents.'

  description: Adolescents (10-17) show lower lifetime prevalence (23.3%) than adults (18+) at 34.9%,
    but still concerning high-risk use patterns
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The wide confidence intervals reflect significant structural variation across the
    region in alcohol policy, availability, and cultural contexts. Limited population-level surveillance
    data in many countries represents a structural barrier to public health intervention. The inclusion
    of high-risk alcohol use as an outcome reflects attention to harmful drinking patterns beyond simple
    consumption.
