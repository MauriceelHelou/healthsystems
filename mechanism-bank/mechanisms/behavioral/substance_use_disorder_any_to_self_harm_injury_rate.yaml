direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use impairs judgment, emotional regulation, and impulse control
  through neurobiological effects on prefrontal cortex and limbic system functioning'
- 'Step 2: Intoxication states lower inhibitions and reduce the threshold for acting
  on self-destructive urges or suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic substance use exacerbates psychiatric symptoms including depression
  and psychotic symptoms, which are independent risk factors for deliberate self-harm'
- 'Step 4: Substance use creates social, occupational, and interpersonal problems
  that increase psychological distress and hopelessness'
- 'Step 5: The combined effect of disinhibition, worsened mental state, and accumulated
  life stressors increases the likelihood of deliberate self-harm episodes'

description: This meta-analysis of 18 studies on first-episode psychosis patients
  found that substance use significantly increases the risk of deliberate self-harm
  (OR=1.46). Importantly, substance use was identified as a risk factor for DSH both
  before and after treatment, suggesting it represents a consistent behavioral pathway
  to self-harm. The association operates alongside other risk factors including alcohol
  abuse (OR=1.68), depression, and prior history of self-harm. The mechanism involves
  substance-induced disinhibition, worsening of psychiatric symptoms, and accumulation
  of psychosocial stressors.
