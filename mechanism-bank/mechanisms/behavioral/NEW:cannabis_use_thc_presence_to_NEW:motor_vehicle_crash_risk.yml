description: The companion systematic review referenced in this paper examined 17 epidemiological studies
  and concluded there is no convincing epidemiological evidence that prior cannabis use (indicated by
  THC presence) directly increases crash risk. This null finding from the first review motivated the current
  examination of potential indirect effects through alcohol interaction.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This evidence challenges assumptions embedded in many drug-impaired driving policies
    that treat THC detection as equivalent to impairment. Per se laws criminalizing any detectable THC
    may not be supported by epidemiological evidence of increased crash risk. From an equity standpoint,
    cannabis detection can persist long after impairment ends, potentially leading to unjust criminalization
    of individuals who used cannabis days prior, disproportionately affecting communities with higher
    policing intensity.
