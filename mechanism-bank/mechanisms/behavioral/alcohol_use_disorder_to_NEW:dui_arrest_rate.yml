description: While not directly measured in this study, the underlying mechanism connecting alcohol consumption
  to DUI arrests is implied in the public health framing. DUI arrests serve as a proxy indicator of alcohol-impaired
  driving behavior, which is fundamentally linked to patterns of alcohol use and misuse in the population.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism acknowledges that individual alcohol use occurs within broader structural
    contexts including alcohol availability, treatment access, and socioeconomic factors. DUI arrests
    disproportionately affect certain populations due to differential policing patterns and access to
    alternative transportation. A structural competency approach would recognize that addressing DUI requires
    upstream interventions including alcohol policy, treatment availability, and transportation infrastructure,
    rather than solely punitive enforcement measures.
