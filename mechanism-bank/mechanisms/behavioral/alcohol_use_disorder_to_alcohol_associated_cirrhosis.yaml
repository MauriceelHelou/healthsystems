direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to chronic sustained alcohol consumption in
  young women'
- 'Step 2: Repeated hepatotoxic exposure causes progressive hepatocellular injury
  and inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing liver damage results in fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis development'
- 'Step 4: Advanced cirrhosis leads to increased mortality with age-standardized mortality
  rate of 0.75 per 100,000'
