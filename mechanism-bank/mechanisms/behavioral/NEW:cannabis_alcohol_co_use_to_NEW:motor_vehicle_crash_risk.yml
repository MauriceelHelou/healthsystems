direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior use of cannabis results in detectable THC in body fluids'
- 'Step 2: Concurrent alcohol consumption produces measurable blood alcohol concentration'
- 'Step 3: Meta-analysis of exacerbation odds ratios examined whether combined effects exceed additive
  model'
- 'Step 4: Evidence fails to support synergistic or multiplicative interaction between substances on crash
  risk'
- 'Step 5: Observed effects appear consistent with independent rather than exacerbated risk profiles'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined whether co-use of cannabis exacerbates
  the effect of alcohol on motor vehicle crash risk. Analyzing 12 epidemiological studies that investigated
  joint effects, the meta-analysis of exacerbation odds ratios found no credible evidence that cannabis
  co-use amplifies alcohol's crash risk. This null finding is important for policy as it suggests combined
  substance effects may not be synergistic.

  description: The review specifically examined whether cannabis exacerbates alcohol's effect on crash
    risk, but found no credible evidence of exacerbation

  equity_implications: This finding has structural policy implications for impaired driving laws and substance
    use regulations. Understanding that combined cannabis-alcohol effects may not be synergistic informs
    evidence-based policy development. From an equity perspective, drug testing policies that assume multiplicative
    effects could disproportionately penalize certain populations. The focus on epidemiological evidence
    rather than individual blame aligns with structural approaches to traffic safety policy.
