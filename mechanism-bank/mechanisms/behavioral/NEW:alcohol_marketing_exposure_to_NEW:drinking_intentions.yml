  description: Youth and adolescents show stronger effects - advertisements focusing on appealing contexts
    may be more readily accepted and less easily extinguished in this population
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies the alcohol industry's marketing practices as a structural
    determinant of health. The industry's desire for self-regulation over external restrictions perpetuates
    exposure. Policy interventions restricting advertising are identified as effective structural solutions
    rather than individual behavior change approaches.
