direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individualized nutritional intervention provides personalized dietary planning
  based on Mediterranean/DASH diet principles, adapted to local food culture and socioeconomic
  context'
- 'Step 2: Consistent dietary adherence over 12 months leads to improved eating habits
  with increased consumption of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and
  healthy fats while reducing refined carbohydrates and processed foods'
- 'Step 3: Improved dietary composition reduces postprandial glucose spikes and overall
  glycemic variability through lower glycemic index foods and better macronutrient
  balance'
- 'Step 4: Sustained dietary changes result in significant reductions in fasting blood
  glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), reflecting improved long-term glycemic control'
- 'Step 5: Regular nutritional consultations and monitoring reinforce behavioral changes
  and maintain glycemic improvements even during follow-up periods without active
  intervention'

description: Individualized nutritional intervention based on Mediterranean/DASH diet
  principles significantly reduces HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes over
  12 months. The intervention group showed significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline
  to 12 months (p<0.05), while the control group experienced significant increases
  in HbA1c over the same period. The dietary intervention was adapted to local food
  culture and socioeconomic conditions, demonstrating the importance of culturally
  appropriate nutritional guidance. Effects were sustained during a 3-month follow-up
  period when active nutritional intervention ceased.
