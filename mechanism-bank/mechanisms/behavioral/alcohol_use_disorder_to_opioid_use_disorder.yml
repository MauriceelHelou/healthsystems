- 'Step 1: Unhealthy alcohol use and opioid misuse share common risk factors including chronic pain, mental
  health conditions, and socioeconomic stressors'
- 'Step 2: Co-occurring use patterns increase neurobiological vulnerability through shared reward pathway
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Combined use increases risk of overdose and emergency healthcare utilization'
- 'Step 4: High co-occurrence rate drives elevated mortality risk in affected populations'

description: The abstract notes that 'the co-occurrence of unhealthy alcohol use and opioid misuse is
  high and associated with increased rates of overdose, emergency health care utilization, and death.'
  This establishes the baseline association that motivates the intervention study.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The co-occurrence of alcohol and opioid use disorders reflects shared structural
    determinants including inadequate pain management systems, mental health service gaps, economic precarity,
    and trauma exposure. Veteran populations face particular risks related to service-connected injuries,
    PTSD, and transition challenges. Addressing these shared root causes requires integrated, whole-person
    care approaches rather than siloed treatment systems.
