mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Physical activity during second trimester helps counteract increasing placental hormone-induced
  insulin resistance'
- 'Step 2: Linear dose-response relationship indicates consistent benefit with each additional unit of
  physical activity'
- 'Step 3: Higher activity volumes (20-50 MET-h/week) provide progressively greater protection against
  GDM development'
- 'Step 4: Continued physical activity maintains glucose homeostasis during period of peak metabolic stress'

description: Physical activity during the second trimester demonstrates a linear dose-response relationship
  with GDM risk. At 10 MET-h/week, risk is reduced by 1% compared to inactive individuals, but higher
  doses (20-50 MET-h/week) provide progressively greater reductions.

  equity_implications: Second trimester physical activity may be constrained by occupational demands,
    particularly for pregnant individuals in jobs requiring prolonged standing or sitting without flexibility
    for exercise breaks. Access to prenatal fitness programs, safe outdoor spaces, and affordable childcare
    for those with other children affects ability to maintain physical activity during this period. Socioeconomic
    disparities in these resources contribute to differential GDM risk across populations.
