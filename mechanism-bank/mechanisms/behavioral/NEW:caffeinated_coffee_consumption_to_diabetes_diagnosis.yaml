category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular caffeinated coffee consumption introduces bioactive compounds including
  caffeine, chlorogenic acids, and other polyphenols into the body'
- 'Step 2: These compounds may improve glucose metabolism through multiple pathways
  including enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced hepatic glucose output, and improved
  beta-cell function'
- 'Step 3: Chlorogenic acids and other antioxidants in coffee reduce oxidative stress
  and inflammation, which are key contributors to insulin resistance'
- 'Step 4: Chronic consumption leads to sustained metabolic benefits that reduce the
  risk of developing type 2 diabetes over time'

description: Caffeinated coffee consumption is inversely associated with type 2 diabetes
  risk, with a 10% reduction in risk among coffee consumers compared to non-consumers.
  The meta-analysis of 26 prospective studies involving over 3.7 million participants
  found a linear dose-response relationship, indicating that higher coffee consumption
  is associated with progressively lower diabetes risk. This protective effect is
  attributed to coffee's bioactive compounds including caffeine and chlorogenic acids
  that improve glucose metabolism and reduce inflammation.
