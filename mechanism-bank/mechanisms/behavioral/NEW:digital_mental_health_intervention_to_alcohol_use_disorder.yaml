direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital interventions deliver evidence-based therapeutic content (e.g.,
  cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing) targeting both depression
  and alcohol use simultaneously'
- 'Step 2: Users engage with self-monitoring tools, psychoeducation, and behavior
  change techniques that increase awareness of drinking patterns and their relationship
  to mood'
- 'Step 3: Addressing comorbid depression reduces negative affect-driven drinking
  motivations and improves self-regulation capacity'
- 'Step 4: Over time (particularly by 6-month follow-up), reduced depressive symptoms
  and enhanced coping skills lead to decreased problematic alcohol consumption'

description: Digital interventions targeting both depression and problematic alcohol
  use simultaneously produce small but significant reductions in alcohol consumption
  at 6-month follow-up (Hedges' g = 0.14). The meta-analysis of 6 trials found that
  integrated digital approaches addressing the comorbidity are effective, with effects
  on alcohol use emerging over time while depressive symptom improvements occur earlier
  (significant at 3-month follow-up). Evidence quality was rated moderate using GRADE
  methodology.
