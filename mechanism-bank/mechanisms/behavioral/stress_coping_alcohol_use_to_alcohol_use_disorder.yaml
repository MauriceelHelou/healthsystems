mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals experiencing stress, trauma, or negative affect use alcohol
  as a coping mechanism to manage psychological distress and achieve short-term relief'
- 'Step 2: Repeated use of alcohol for coping reinforces this behavior pattern, creating
  psychological dependence and tolerance, while failing to address underlying stressors'
- 'Step 3: The maladaptive coping pattern escalates into problematic drinking behaviors
  that meet criteria for alcohol use disorder, including loss of control, continued
  use despite consequences, and functional impairment'

description: Stress-coping alcohol use represents a maladaptive behavioral pattern
  where individuals use alcohol to manage psychological distress, trauma symptoms,
  or negative emotions. This coping strategy creates a reinforcement cycle where alcohol
  provides temporary relief from distress but ultimately exacerbates underlying problems
  and creates dependence. The mechanism operates through negative reinforcement learning,
  where alcohol use is strengthened by its ability to reduce negative emotional states.
  Over time, this pattern leads to tolerance, escalating consumption, and the development
  of alcohol use disorder symptoms including loss of control, continued use despite
  consequences, and functional impairment.
structural_competency_notes: Structural factors significantly influence this pathway,
  as individuals with limited access to mental health services, social support, or
  healthy coping resources may be more likely to rely on alcohol for stress management.
  Socioeconomic disadvantage, discrimination, and systemic trauma exposure can increase
  both stress levels and barriers to alternative coping strategies, creating conditions
  where alcohol becomes a primary coping mechanism.
