direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults employ protective behavioral strategies during drinking occasions'
- 'Step 2: PBS include safety strategies like designating a sober driver, avoiding dangerous situations,
  and pacing drinks'
- 'Step 3: These strategies reduce both acute intoxication levels and high-risk drinking contexts'
- 'Step 4: Lower intoxication and safer contexts decrease probability of negative alcohol consequences
  including injuries, academic problems, and social harms'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative harm reduction across drinking occasions leads to lower overall consequence burden'

description: The vast majority of studies (91%, n=91) examined PBS effects on alcohol consequences, with
  91% of total PBS effect studies finding significant negative associations. This represents robust evidence
  that protective behavioral strategies reduce alcohol-related harms in young adults.
moderators:
- name: PBS subscale type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: 78% of subscale analyses found at least one significant negative relation with alcohol-related
    consequences; effects varied by strategy type (e.g., manner of drinking subscales)
- name: Total vs subscale measurement
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: 91% of studies using total PBS scores found negative associations with consequences, compared
    to 78% of subscale analyses
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol-related consequences disproportionately affect populations with less access
    to protective resources (safe transportation, recovery environments, social support). Structural interventions
    should ensure equitable access to PBS education and supportive environments that facilitate strategy
    implementation. Campus and community-level policies can create contexts where PBS are easier to practice.
