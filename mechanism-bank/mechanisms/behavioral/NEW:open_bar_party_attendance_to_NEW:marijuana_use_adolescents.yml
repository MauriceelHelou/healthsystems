description: Open bar party attendance is associated with higher odds of marijuana use among early adolescents,
  suggesting these environments facilitate polysubstance use
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 5213
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The association reflects how unregulated commercial alcohol environments create
    spaces where multiple substance use behaviors cluster. Policy failure to enforce age restrictions
    enables these high-risk environments.
