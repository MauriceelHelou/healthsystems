direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol consumption levels among males lead to greater cumulative exposure'
- 'Step 2: Male-specific hormonal interactions with alcohol metabolism may enhance inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-induced oxidative stress and immune activation preferentially affects male skin physiology'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation triggers psoriatic disease initiation and progression'

description: Sex-stratified analysis showing significantly elevated psoriasis risk among male alcohol
  consumers with 84% increased odds compared to non-consumers. The association in females was not statistically
  significant (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.97-1.54), indicating important sex-based differences in alcohol-psoriasis
  relationship.

  equity_implications: 'Sex differences in alcohol-related health outcomes reflect intersecting structural
    factors: gendered social norms around drinking, occupational exposure patterns, differential access
    to healthcare and early intervention, and biological differences in alcohol metabolism. Male-dominated
    occupational contexts often normalize higher alcohol consumption, while men may face barriers to seeking
    help for both alcohol use and skin conditions due to masculinity norms.'
