description: Current smokeless tobacco use was associated with increased vulvar cancer risk among never-smokers,
  with over two-fold elevated odds. The plausible mechanism involves intravaginal snuff use, a cultural
  practice that directly exposes genital tissue to carcinogens.

  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects culturally embedded practices specific to African women.
    The intravaginal use of snuff is a practice that requires culturally sensitive public health approaches
    rather than stigmatization. Structural factors including limited sexual health education, poverty,
    and restricted access to healthcare services contribute to the persistence of potentially harmful
    practices. Interventions must engage community leaders and address social determinants.
