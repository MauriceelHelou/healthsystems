direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Electronic cigarette use exposes adolescents and young adults to nicotine,
  which affects developing brain regions involved in mood regulation and stress response'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine exposure during critical neurodevelopmental periods alters neurotransmitter
  systems (dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine) that regulate emotional processing'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted neurotransmitter function increases vulnerability to internalizing
  mental health symptoms including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: The bidirectional relationship may also involve youth with existing mental
  health problems self-medicating with electronic cigarettes'
