direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Light alcohol consumption (≤2 drinks/week) may increase HDL cholesterol and improve lipid profiles'
- 'Step 2: Moderate alcohol intake associated with reduced platelet aggregation and improved fibrinolytic
  activity'
- 'Step 3: Anti-inflammatory effects at low doses may reduce chronic vascular inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Preserved endothelial function and reduced atherosclerotic progression in peripheral arteries'

description: Light alcohol consumption was associated with a 17% reduced risk of peripheral artery disease
  compared to non/never drinkers (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.89). The lowest PAD risk was observed at approximately
  2 drinks/week in nonlinear analysis.

  description: Optimal protective effect observed at approximately 2 drinks/week; protection diminishes

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding should not be interpreted as recommending alcohol initiation for non-drinkers.
    Structural factors influencing drinking patterns include cultural norms, socioeconomic conditions,
    and access to alternative stress-coping resources. Public health messaging must consider potential
    harms of alcohol promotion.
