direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Informal caregiving involves repetitive physical tasks such as lifting,
  transferring, and assisting care recipients with mobility, leading to musculoskeletal
  strain'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress from caregiving responsibilities triggers sustained physiological
  stress responses, including elevated cortisol and inflammatory markers that sensitize
  pain pathways'
- 'Step 3: Caregivers often neglect self-care behaviors including exercise, rest,
  and timely medical attention for their own health issues'
- 'Step 4: The combination of physical strain, psychological stress, and reduced self-care
  leads to increased incidence of diseases of the spine and chronic pain conditions'

description: Informal caregiving is associated with increased incidence of chronic
  pain conditions, including diseases of the spine and general pain. Evidence from
  a large longitudinal German health-insurance evaluation showed statistically significant
  increased incidence of pain conditions among informal caregivers compared to non-caregivers.
  Cross-sectional studies across multiple countries confirmed higher occurrence of
  pain in caregiver populations. The mechanism involves both direct physical strain
  from caregiving tasks and indirect effects through chronic stress and neglected
  self-care.
