direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) have reduced ability
  to negotiate safe sex practices, including condom use, due to power imbalances in
  relationships'
- 'Step 2: Physical and sexual violence directly increases HIV transmission risk through
  forced unprotected sexual contact and trauma to genital tissues'
- 'Step 3: IPV often co-occurs with harmful alcohol use in a syndemic interaction,
  further reducing protective behaviors and increasing HIV risk'
- 'Step 4: The synergistic interaction between physical IPV, alcohol use, and HIV
  creates a multiplicative effect on transmission risk beyond additive individual
  contributions'

description: Intimate partner violence, particularly physical violence, increases
  HIV incidence through direct transmission risk during forced sexual contact, reduced
  ability to negotiate safe sex, and syndemic interactions with harmful alcohol use.
  In South Africa, these factors cluster geographically and interact synergistically
  (Synergy index = 2.77), meaning their combined effect on HIV risk exceeds what would
  be expected from their individual contributions. The SAVA (substance abuse, violence,
  and AIDS) syndemic framework captures this intertwined reality affecting women in
  HIV-endemic settings.
