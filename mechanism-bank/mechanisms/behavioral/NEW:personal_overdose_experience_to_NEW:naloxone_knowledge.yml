description: Male participants who had personally experienced an overdose were 1.5 times more likely to
  correctly identify naloxone as an opioid overdose treatment compared to those without personal overdose
  experience, after adjustment for age, race, education, housing status, heroin use, and injection drug
  use.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals a structural gap in harm reduction education. The finding
    that personal overdose experience is associated with knowledge (in men) suggests that systematic OEND
    education is not reaching this population proactively. The reliance on near-death experience as a
    pathway to knowledge represents a failure of healthcare and criminal justice systems to provide preemptive
    education. Gender differences may reflect differential access to harm reduction services or healthcare
    contact patterns.
