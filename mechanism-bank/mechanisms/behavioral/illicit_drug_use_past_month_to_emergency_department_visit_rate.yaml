direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Illicit drug use (heroin, methamphetamine, crack cocaine, etc.) leads to
  acute intoxication, overdose events, and drug-related medical emergencies requiring
  immediate care'
- 'Step 2: Chronic drug use causes or exacerbates physical health conditions (infections,
  cardiovascular events, injuries) and mental health crises that necessitate emergency
  intervention'
- 'Step 3: Social determinants associated with drug use (unstable housing, lack of
  primary care access, injection practices) create barriers to preventive care, channeling
  health needs to emergency departments'
- 'Step 4: Emergency departments become the default point of healthcare access for
  people who use drugs, resulting in ED utilization rates 4.8 times higher than the
  general population'

description: People who use illicit drugs present to emergency departments at a pooled
  rate of 151 per 100 person-years, approximately 4.8 times more frequently than the
  general population. This elevated utilization is driven by acute drug-related emergencies,
  chronic health complications, co-occurring mental health conditions, and structural
  barriers to accessing preventive primary care.
