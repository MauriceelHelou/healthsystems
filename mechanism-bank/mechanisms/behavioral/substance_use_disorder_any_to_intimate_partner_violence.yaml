direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use (alcohol and/or drugs) impairs cognitive functioning, reducing
  impulse control and judgment'
- 'Step 2: Impaired executive function decreases ability to regulate aggressive impulses
  and resolve conflicts non-violently'
- 'Step 3: Substance use may increase hostile attributions toward intimate partners
  and lower thresholds for aggressive responses'
- 'Step 4: These cognitive and behavioral disinhibition effects increase the likelihood
  of physical, emotional, and sexual intimate partner violence perpetration'

description: Substance use disorder is consistently associated with increased risk
  of intimate partner violence perpetration among men. Meta-analytic evidence from
  Sub-Saharan Africa identifies substance use as a significant risk marker with small
  effect sizes for male physical IPV perpetration. Intervention research targeting
  men who use substances and perpetrate IPV confirms the co-occurrence but shows that
  integrated treatments have not yet demonstrated superiority over standard care,
  suggesting the relationship is complex and may involve multiple mechanisms beyond
  simple disinhibition.
