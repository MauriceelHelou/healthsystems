direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol is widely available across sub-Saharan African countries with varying regulatory environments'
- 'Step 2: Population exposure to alcohol leads to initiation and regular use patterns'
- 'Step 3: Regular alcohol consumption progresses to problematic use patterns in vulnerable individuals'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol use disorders develop with 12-month prevalence of 9.5% among adults and 7.7% among
  adolescents'

description: 'This systematic review and meta-analysis of 141 papers documents population-level alcohol
  use patterns across sub-Saharan Africa. Among adults, 12-month prevalence of alcohol use disorder was
  9.5% (CI: 0.0-30.4%) and alcohol dependence was 4.3% (CI: 0.8-9.8%). Among adolescents, 12-month prevalence
  of alcohol use disorder was 7.7% (CI: 0.0-27.8%) and alcohol dependence was 4.1% (CI: 1.4-7.9%).'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The study highlights that comprehensive population-level data on alcohol use remain
    scarce in numerous sub-Saharan African countries, indicating structural gaps in public health surveillance.
    The high prevalence of alcohol use disorder among adolescents (7.7%) points to inadequate structural
    protections for youth. Wide confidence intervals suggest heterogeneous regulatory and social environments
    across the region affecting alcohol exposure.
