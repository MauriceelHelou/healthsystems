description: Job search self-efficacy is measured as a secondary outcome, reflecting the hypothesized
  psychological benefit of achieving competitive employment through IPS intervention.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 832
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While self-efficacy is an individual-level construct, this mechanism recognizes
    that prolonged unemployment erodes confidence through structural exclusion, not individual deficit.
    Interventions that address structural barriers to employment can restore self-efficacy.
