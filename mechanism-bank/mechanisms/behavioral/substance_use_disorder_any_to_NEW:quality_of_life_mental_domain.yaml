mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorders create neurobiological changes affecting mood regulation,
  cognitive function, and emotional processing'
- 'Step 2: SUD leads to behavioral changes including social withdrawal, impaired decision-making,
  and potential reckless or suicidal behaviors (especially with cocaine use)'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with SUD experience high rates of comorbid mental disorders
  and trauma symptoms that compound mental health impairment'
- 'Step 4: Severity of substance use disorder directly correlates with worse mental
  quality of life outcomes'
- 'Step 5: Reduced mental QoL manifests as psychological distress, diminished life
  satisfaction, and impaired psychological well-being'

description: Substance use disorders are associated with significantly lower mental
  quality of life through multiple mechanisms including neurobiological effects on
  mood and cognition, behavioral changes leading to reckless behaviors, and high rates
  of comorbid mental health conditions. The relationship is dose-dependent, with more
  severe SUD associated with worse mental QoL outcomes. Social support from family
  and friends serves as a protective factor, while cocaine use and comorbid psychiatric
  conditions exacerbate the negative impact.
