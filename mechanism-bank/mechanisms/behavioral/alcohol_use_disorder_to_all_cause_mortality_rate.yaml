direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to chronic heavy alcohol consumption, causing
  direct toxic effects on multiple organ systems including the liver, cardiovascular
  system, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol exposure results in increased risk of cardiovascular
  disease (leading cause of death), liver cirrhosis, gastrointestinal diseases, and
  alcohol-related cancers'
- 'Step 3: AUD impairs immune function and increases susceptibility to infections
  (including COVID-19 severity), respiratory diseases, and complications from other
  illnesses'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral consequences of AUD including impaired judgment, risk-taking,
  and psychiatric comorbidities lead to elevated rates of unnatural deaths (accidents,
  suicides, violence)'
- 'Step 5: These combined pathophysiological and behavioral effects result in significantly
  elevated all-cause mortality rates 3-4 times higher than the general population'

description: Alcohol use disorder significantly increases all-cause mortality through
  multiple interconnected pathways. Meta-analyses consistently demonstrate that individuals
  with AUD have 3-4 times higher mortality risk compared to the general population.
  The most common causes of death include cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal
  diseases (particularly liver cirrhosis), unnatural deaths (accidents, suicide, violence),
  neoplasms, and respiratory diseases. The mortality burden is particularly severe
  among younger individuals and women. Recent evidence also shows AUD increases severity
  and mortality from infectious diseases like COVID-19. Importantly, reducing alcohol
  consumption can significantly mitigate mortality risk even without achieving complete
  abstinence.
