direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Shortened time windows for alcohol access (e.g., ''happy hour'' promotions) create temporal
  scarcity of drinking opportunity'
- 'Step 2: Temporal scarcity drives compensatory ''front-loading'' behavior - rapid consumption of alcohol
  in the initial minutes of access'
- 'Step 3: Front-loading increases drinking rate and total alcohol consumed within compressed timeframes'
- 'Step 4: Accelerated consumption leads to higher peak blood alcohol concentrations and binge-level intake'

description: This animal model study demonstrates that compressing alcohol access time from 30 to 15 minutes
  significantly increases front-loading drinking behavior, resulting in higher total alcohol consumption.
  This models the 'happy hour' effect where time-limited drinking promotions may drive faster, more dangerous
  drinking patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism has important policy implications for alcohol regulation. Happy
    hour promotions and time-limited drink specials represent structural incentives that drive rapid consumption
    patterns. The finding that compressed access windows increased consumption suggests that policies
    permitting or promoting time-limited alcohol deals may contribute to harmful drinking patterns. The
    sex difference findings indicate women may be more vulnerable to front-loading behavior at baseline,
    while men may be more susceptible to promotional incentives that compress drinking windows.
