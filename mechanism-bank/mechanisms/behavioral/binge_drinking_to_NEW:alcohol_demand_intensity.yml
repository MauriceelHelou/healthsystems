direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy drinking episodes produce neuroadaptive changes in reward circuitry'
- 'Step 2: These neurobiological changes increase the reinforcing value of alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Elevated reinforcing value manifests as higher demand intensity on behavioral economic measures'
- 'Step 4: This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where drinking increases demand which promotes further
  drinking'

description: The bidirectional nature of the association shows that heavy drinking in one quarter predicted
  higher alcohol demand intensity in the subsequent quarter. This supports behavioral economic theory
  that alcohol consumption reinforces and elevates the subjective value of alcohol, creating vulnerability
  to continued problematic use.

  description: Heavy drinking (vs. moderate drinking or abstinence) more strongly predicted subsequent
    elevated demand intensity
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This reverse pathway has implications for structural interventions: reducing alcohol
    availability and marketing exposure during early recovery could help break the demand-consumption
    cycle. Communities with higher alcohol outlet density and aggressive alcohol marketing may create
    environments that accelerate this reinforcement cycle, particularly for those attempting natural recovery
    without treatment support.'
