direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IPV survivors access technology-based digital interventions (apps, web-based
  programs, computer-assisted therapy) that provide psychoeducation, safety planning,
  and coping strategies'
- 'Step 2: Digital interventions deliver evidence-based therapeutic content including
  cognitive-behavioral techniques, mindfulness exercises, and stress management tools
  in accessible formats'
- 'Step 3: Increased knowledge about IPV dynamics, enhanced coping skills, and improved
  access to resources reduce hypervigilance and fear responses'
- 'Step 4: Regular engagement with intervention content promotes emotional regulation
  and reduces anxiety-related cognitions and physiological arousal'
- 'Step 5: Anxiety symptoms decrease as survivors gain sense of control, improved
  safety planning, and enhanced psychological coping mechanisms'

  survivors significantly reduce anxiety symptoms in the short-term (0-3 months).
  This meta-analysis of 17 RCTs involving 4,590 female IPV survivors found a small
  but statistically significant effect (SMD = -0.27) with low heterogeneity (I² =
  25%). Digital interventions provide accessible, scalable delivery of therapeutic
  content that addresses anxiety comorbidities common among IPV survivors, who experience
  anxiety three to five times more frequently than non-survivors.
