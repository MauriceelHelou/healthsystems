direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Never-users of alcohol encounter digital alcohol marketing through social media, gaming platforms,
  and streaming services'
- 'Step 2: Marketing content portrays alcohol use as normative, attractive, and associated with positive
  social outcomes'
- 'Step 3: Exposure creates cognitive susceptibility - openness to trying alcohol in the future'
- 'Step 4: Pro-alcohol attitudes develop before any actual drinking behavior occurs'
- 'Step 5: Susceptibility predicts future alcohol initiation, particularly among adolescents'

description: Digital alcohol marketing exposure is associated with increased susceptibility to alcohol
  use among never-users. This measure captures the gateway effect of marketing on attitudes before actual
  drinking behavior begins, particularly relevant for adolescent populations who have not yet initiated
  alcohol use.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism is critical for understanding how structural factors (digital marketing
    environment) shape health trajectories before individuals make any behavioral choices. The concept
    of 'susceptibility' emphasizes that commercial environments pre-condition youth toward alcohol use
    through attitude formation. This represents a failure of regulatory structures to protect minors from
    commercial influence. Equity implications include differential exposure based on digital access patterns
    and targeting algorithms that may concentrate marketing toward vulnerable populations.
