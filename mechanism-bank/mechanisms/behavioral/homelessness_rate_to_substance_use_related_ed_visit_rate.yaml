direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) lack stable housing and face chronic
  stressors including exposure to violence, trauma, and lack of safe spaces, which
  increases vulnerability to substance use as a coping mechanism'
- 'Step 2: PEH have limited access to primary care and preventive health services,
  making the ED their primary or only source of healthcare'
- 'Step 3: Substance use among PEH leads to acute medical emergencies including alcohol-related
  diagnoses (up to one-third of ED visits) and substance poisoning (up to one-quarter
  of ED visits)'
- 'Step 4: PEH visit EDs at significantly higher rates than housed populations (rate
  ratio 1.63 to 18.75), with substance-related presentations dominating these visits'

description: Homelessness significantly increases substance use-related ED visits
  through multiple pathways. Persons experiencing homelessness use EDs as their primary
  healthcare source due to lack of access to preventive care. Substance-related presentations,
  including alcohol-related diagnoses (up to one-third) and substance poisoning (up
  to one-quarter), dominate ED visits by this population. PEH visit EDs at rates 1.63
  to 18.75 times higher than housed populations.
