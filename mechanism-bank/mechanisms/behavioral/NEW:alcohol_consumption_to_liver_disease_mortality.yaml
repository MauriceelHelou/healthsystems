direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to repeated hepatocyte exposure to ethanol
  and its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde'
- 'Step 2: Sustained alcohol exposure causes progressive liver damage through oxidative
  stress, inflammation, and hepatocyte death'
- 'Step 3: Repeated cycles of injury and repair lead to fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis
  of liver tissue'
- 'Step 4: Advanced cirrhosis results in liver failure, portal hypertension, and increased
  mortality risk'

description: Natural experiment evidence from Canadian alcohol prohibition (1901-1956)
  demonstrates that reduced alcohol consumption (through prohibition policies) led
  to decreased liver cirrhosis mortality rates. The pooled meta-analysis across 7
  Canadian provinces found prohibition was associated with 0.39 fewer liver cirrhosis
  deaths per 100,000 people. When restricted to provinces with complete temporal data,
  the effect was larger at 0.65 fewer deaths per 100,000. This provides strong quasi-experimental
  evidence that population-level alcohol consumption directly influences liver cirrhosis
  mortality rates.
