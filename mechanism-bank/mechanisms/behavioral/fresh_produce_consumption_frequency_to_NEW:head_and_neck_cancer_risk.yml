direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher fruit and vegetable intake increases dietary antioxidants (vitamins C, E, carotenoids,
  flavonoids)'
- 'Step 2: Antioxidants protect oral mucosa and pharyngeal epithelium from oxidative damage'
- 'Step 3: Phytochemicals modulate cellular signaling pathways involved in apoptosis and cell proliferation'
- 'Step 4: Fiber content supports beneficial gut microbiome which influences systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative protective effects reduce carcinogenesis in head and neck tissues'

description: Individual component analyses from three studies within the systematic review revealed that
  higher fruit and vegetable consumption significantly decreased head and neck cancer risk, representing
  a key driver of the overall Mediterranean diet protective effect.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to fruits and vegetables is structurally determined by grocery store density,
    food desert prevalence, SNAP benefit adequacy, and neighborhood food environments. Low-income communities
    and communities of color disproportionately lack access to affordable fresh produce, creating structural
    barriers to cancer prevention through diet.
