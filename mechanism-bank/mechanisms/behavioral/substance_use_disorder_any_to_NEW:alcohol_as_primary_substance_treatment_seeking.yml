description: Among treatment-seeking individuals with substance use disorders in the Eastern Mediterranean
  region, 16.9% (95% CI 8.8-26.9%) report alcohol as their primary substance of use. This indicates that
  despite lower overall population prevalence, alcohol remains a significant contributor to treatment
  demand.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The proportion of treatment-seeking patients with alcohol as primary substance
    (16.9%) is notably higher than the general population prevalence (6.2%), suggesting that among those
    who do use alcohol in this region, problematic use requiring treatment is relatively common. This
    may reflect limited harm reduction resources, greater severity among those who use despite social/legal
    barriers, or selection bias in who accesses treatment.
