direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Digital platforms (social media, websites, apps) serve as ubiquitous channels for alcohol brand
  marketing content'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to digital alcohol marketing normalizes drinking behaviors and creates positive associations
  with alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Marketing content targets adolescents and young adults through algorithms and age-inappropriate
  placement'
- 'Step 4: Repeated exposure shapes pro-alcohol attitudes and perceived social norms around drinking'
- 'Step 5: Increased pro-alcohol attitudes translate to higher likelihood of binge drinking behavior'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural driver of alcohol harm - the digital marketing
    environment created by alcohol industry practices and inadequate regulation. Rather than blaming individuals
    for drinking, it highlights how commercial determinants of health (alcohol industry marketing strategies)
    shape population-level behaviors. Adolescents and young adults are disproportionately targeted and
    vulnerable, creating an equity concern. Policy interventions should focus on regulating digital alcohol
    marketing rather than individual behavior change.
