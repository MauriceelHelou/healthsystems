direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: All study conditions included daily monitoring of cannabis usage'
- 'Step 2: Self-monitoring may increase awareness of consumption patterns and triggers'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced awareness could facilitate behavior change across all conditions'
- 'Step 4: This monitoring effect may explain why no differential treatment effects were observed'

description: All three conditions (MBI, Relaxation, Control) included daily monitoring of cannabis usage.
  This common element across conditions may have produced a floor effect, where monitoring alone facilitated
  some awareness and potential behavior change, making it difficult to detect differential effects of
  the mindfulness intervention specifically.

  description: Participants were required to have attempted to cut down or quit in the past 2 years, indicating
    motivation that may enhance monitoring effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Self-monitoring represents a low-cost, accessible intervention component that does
    not require specialized treatment infrastructure. However, the study does not address structural determinants
    that drive cannabis use disorder, such as economic stress, trauma history, or criminalization of cannabis
    use that may create barriers to formal treatment seeking.
