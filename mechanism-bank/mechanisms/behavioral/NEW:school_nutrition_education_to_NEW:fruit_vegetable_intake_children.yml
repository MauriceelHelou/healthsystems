structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While nutrition education involves knowledge transfer, when implemented as a universal
    school-based program it represents a structural intervention that provides equitable access to nutrition
    information regardless of family socioeconomic status or parental nutrition knowledge. Effectiveness
    may be limited if not paired with environmental changes that make healthy foods accessible.
