mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current smoking exposes individuals to numerous toxic and carcinogenic
  compounds through tobacco combustion, including tar, carbon monoxide, and nicotine'
- 'Step 2: These exposures lead to multiple organ system damage including cardiovascular
  disease, respiratory disorders, and various cancers'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative physiological damage from smoking results in increased mortality
  risk across all causes of death'
- 'Step 4: In non-smoking cohorts compared to smoking cohorts, all-cause mortality
  patterns differ substantially, demonstrating smoking''s confounding role in mortality
  studies'

description: This meta-analysis of 107 longitudinal studies with nearly 5 million
  participants examined how smoking status affects all-cause mortality estimates.
  The study found that in non-smoking cohorts, mortality risk estimates were notably
  elevated (RR=1.16), highlighting smoking's substantial role in modifying mortality
  risk. The research demonstrated that smoking is a critical confounder in mortality
  studies and that controlling for smoking status significantly alters mortality risk
  estimates. The evidence confirms that current smoking is associated with increased
  all-cause mortality through multiple pathological pathways.
