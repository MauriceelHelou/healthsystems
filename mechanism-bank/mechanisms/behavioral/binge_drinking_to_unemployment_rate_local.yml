description: The selection hypothesis (that binge drinkers are more prone to job loss) receives weak and
  largely confounded support. When accounting for time-constant confounding and reciprocal causality,
  the effect of binge drinking on unemployment becomes statistically non-significant, suggesting that
  prior health conditions rather than drinking itself drives the association.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding is crucial for avoiding individual blame - the apparent relationship
    between alcohol use and unemployment is largely explained by confounding factors like pre-existing
    health conditions rather than alcohol causing job loss. This challenges narratives that blame unemployed
    individuals for their drinking and supports structural rather than behavioral interventions.
