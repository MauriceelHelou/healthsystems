direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Studies include former drinkers (who may have quit due to illness) in abstainer reference groups'
- 'Step 2: Former drinkers have elevated mortality risk due to prior alcohol-related health damage or
  underlying conditions'
- 'Step 3: Inclusion of occasional drinkers misclassifies light consumers as abstainers'
- 'Step 4: Contaminated reference groups artificially inflate abstainer mortality rates'
- 'Step 5: This creates spurious appearance of protective effect for low-volume drinkers (RR=0.84 vs true
  RR≈0.98)'

description: The 'sick quitter' bias occurs when former drinkers who quit due to health problems are included
  in abstainer reference groups, artificially inflating abstainer mortality rates and making moderate
  drinkers appear healthier by comparison. This methodological artifact has profoundly influenced alcohol
  epidemiology and public health messaging.

    guidelines that normalize alcohol consumption. The persistence of this methodological flaw across
    decades of research suggests potential conflicts of interest in alcohol research funding. Correcting
    this bias is essential for equitable public health policy that does not differentially harm populations
    with higher alcohol-related risks.'
