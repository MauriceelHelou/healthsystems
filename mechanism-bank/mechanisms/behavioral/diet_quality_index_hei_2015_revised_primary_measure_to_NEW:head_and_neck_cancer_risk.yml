direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adherence to Mediterranean diet increases consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
  olive oil, and fish'
- 'Step 2: These foods provide high levels of antioxidants, polyphenols, and anti-inflammatory compounds'
- 'Step 3: Antioxidants neutralize reactive oxygen species and reduce oxidative stress in oral and pharyngeal
  tissues'
- 'Step 4: Reduced oxidative damage and chronic inflammation decreases DNA damage and cellular mutations'
- 'Step 5: Lower cumulative carcinogenic exposure reduces head and neck cancer development risk'

description: High adherence to the Mediterranean diet is significantly associated with a 44% reduced risk
  of head and neck cancer. The protective effect appears to operate primarily through high fruit and vegetable
  consumption, while other components (legumes, fish, low meat intake) showed no statistically significant
  independent associations.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism has important structural implications: access to Mediterranean
    diet components (fresh fruits, vegetables, olive oil, fish) is shaped by food environment, food deserts,
    economic resources, and cultural food systems. Populations in food deserts or with limited economic
    resources face structural barriers to dietary patterns that could reduce cancer risk. The mechanism
    avoids individual blame by highlighting that dietary patterns are constrained by food availability,
    affordability, and cultural context.'
