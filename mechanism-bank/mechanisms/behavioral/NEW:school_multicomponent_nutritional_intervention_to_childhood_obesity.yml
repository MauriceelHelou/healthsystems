direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multicomponent nutritional interventions in schools combine nutrition education, environmental
  changes (e.g., healthier cafeteria options), and policy modifications'
- 'Step 2: These comprehensive approaches create supportive environments that reinforce healthy eating
  behaviors across multiple settings within the school'
- 'Step 3: Improved dietary behaviors including increased fruit/vegetable intake and reduced fat consumption
  lead to better energy balance'
- 'Step 4: Sustained healthier dietary patterns reduce excess caloric intake and prevent overweight/obesity
  development'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural determinants by modifying the school food environment
    rather than solely relying on individual behavior change. Schools are universal institutions that
    reach children regardless of socioeconomic status, making school-based interventions potentially equity-promoting.
    However, implementation quality may vary by school resources, potentially affecting disadvantaged
    schools disproportionately.
