direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: BSCT provides structured cognitive behavioral therapy-based training for individuals with AUD
  seeking controlled drinking goals'
- 'Step 2: Treatment teaches self-monitoring, goal-setting, and behavioral strategies to manage alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Patients develop skills to recognize triggers and implement alternative responses to drinking
  urges'
- 'Step 4: Sustained behavior change reduces hazardous drinking patterns below harmful thresholds'

description: BSCT was superior to MET in reducing hazardous drinking among individuals with alcohol use
  disorder who had a treatment goal of controlled drinking, though both groups substantially reduced overall
  alcohol consumption

  description: Study included only self-referred adults with stated treatment goal of controlled drinking,
    suggesting self-selection for this modality may enhance outcomes

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of treatment availability and accessibility
    for those seeking non-abstinence goals. The scarcity of controlled drinking treatment options noted
    in the abstract represents a structural barrier in healthcare systems that primarily promote abstinence-only
    approaches, potentially limiting treatment engagement for those unwilling to commit to abstinence.
