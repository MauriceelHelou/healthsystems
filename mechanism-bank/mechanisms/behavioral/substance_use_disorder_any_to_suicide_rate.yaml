  node_name: Suicide Death Rate
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance use disorder creates neurobiological changes that impair emotional
  regulation, impulse control, and decision-making capacity'
- 'Step 2: Chronic substance use leads to social isolation, relationship deterioration,
  and loss of protective social connections'
- 'Step 3: SUD often co-occurs with psychiatric conditions (depression, anxiety) that
  independently increase suicide risk'
- 'Step 4: Intoxication states reduce inhibition and increase impulsivity, facilitating
  transition from suicidal ideation to action'
- 'Step 5: Substance use provides means (overdose) and reduces fear of death, lowering
  barriers to lethal self-harm'

description: Substance use disorder increases suicide death rate by 5-10 times compared
  to the general population through multiple interacting mechanisms including neurobiological
  impairment of impulse control, social deterioration, psychiatric comorbidity, and
  reduced barriers to lethal self-harm during intoxication. The risk persists even
  after treatment initiation, with significant proportions continuing suicidal ideation
  and attempts.
