direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults learn and adopt protective behavioral strategies (PBS) through prevention programs
  or peer influence'
- 'Step 2: PBS implementation includes strategies like limiting number of drinks, alternating alcoholic
  and non-alcoholic beverages, and avoiding drinking games'
- 'Step 3: These harm reduction behaviors directly reduce alcohol consumption volume per drinking occasion'
- 'Step 4: Reduced consumption volume decreases likelihood of reaching binge drinking thresholds'

description: All studies examining total PBS use found significant negative associations with heavy alcohol
  use among young adults aged 18-26. The systematic review found consistent evidence that protective behavioral
  strategies reduce heavy drinking.
moderators:
- name: PBS subscale type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effects varied across type of subscale (e.g., manner of drinking); 73% of subscale analyses
    found significant negative relations with heavy alcohol use
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While PBS are individual behaviors, their adoption is influenced by structural
    factors including access to prevention programs, campus alcohol policies, and social environment norms.
    Interventions promoting PBS should be structurally embedded rather than relying solely on individual
    behavior change. The mechanism avoids blaming individuals by framing PBS as skills that can be taught
    through environmental interventions.
