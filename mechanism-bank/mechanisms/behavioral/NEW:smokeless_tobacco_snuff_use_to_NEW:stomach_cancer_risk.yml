description: Unexpectedly, smokeless tobacco use was associated with 40% lower risk of stomach cancer.
  This counterintuitive finding requires further research and may reflect unmeasured confounding or biological
  mechanisms not yet understood.

  equity_implications: This inverse association requires cautious interpretation and does not justify
    SLT use. The finding may reflect selection bias, survival effects, or unmeasured confounders in this
    case-control design. Structural factors that influence both SLT use and stomach cancer risk (dietary
    patterns, H. pylori prevalence, healthcare access) should be explored.
