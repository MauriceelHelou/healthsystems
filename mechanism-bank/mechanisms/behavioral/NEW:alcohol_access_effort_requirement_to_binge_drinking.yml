direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increasing effort required to obtain alcohol (FR1 to FR3 schedule) creates friction in access'
- 'Step 2: Higher effort requirements reduce front-loading drinking behavior, particularly in males'
- 'Step 3: Reduced front-loading leads to slower drinking pace and lower total consumption'
- 'Step 4: Sex differences in total alcohol intake are diminished when access requires more effort'

description: Increasing the effort required to access alcohol (from 1 lever press per reward to 3 lever
  presses) reduced total alcohol consumption and front-loading behavior, particularly in males. This suggests
  that structural barriers to alcohol access may reduce harmful drinking patterns.

  description: Increased effort requirements had greater impact on male drinking behavior; females showed
    minimal changes in front-loading when effort increased from FR1 to FR3
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding supports policies that increase friction in alcohol access, such as
    reduced outlet density, minimum pricing, or limiting convenience of purchase. The differential effect
    by sex suggests that policy interventions may have variable effectiveness across populations, with
    males potentially more responsive to access barriers. This has implications for understanding how
    the built environment and regulatory policies shape drinking behavior at a population level.
