direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients presenting in general medical settings (primary care, outpatient
  clinics) are screened for alcohol use, identifying those with hazardous drinking
  patterns including binge drinking'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions (typically 5-30 minutes) are delivered by healthcare
  providers, employing motivational interviewing techniques, personalized feedback,
  and goal-setting to enhance motivation for behavior change'
- 'Step 3: The medical setting context leverages the ''teachable moment'' when patients
  may be more receptive to health behavior advice from trusted healthcare providers'
- 'Step 4: Patients develop increased awareness of drinking patterns, associated health
  risks, and strategies for reducing consumption'
- 'Step 5: Behavioral change results in reduced alcohol consumption, equivalent to
  approximately one fewer drinking day per month, thereby reducing binge drinking
  episodes'

description: Alcohol-targeted brief interventions delivered in general medical settings
  produce small but beneficial reductions in alcohol consumption. The meta-analysis
  of 111 trials found a significant effect (Hedges' g = 0.17) when interventions were
  delivered in general medical settings specifically. This effect size translates
  to approximately one fewer drinking day per month. The mechanism operates through
  screening, brief counseling, and leveraging the trusted healthcare provider relationship
  to motivate behavior change. Notably, interventions delivered in emergency departments
  showed inconclusive effects, suggesting the general medical setting context is a
  key moderator.
