direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Energy labeling policy mandates calorie information on alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Consumers become aware of high caloric content in alcoholic drinks'
- 'Step 3: Knowledge of caloric content theoretically influences drinking decisions'
- 'Step 4: Potential reduction in alcohol consumption through informed choice'
- 'Step 5: However, current evidence shows no demonstrated effect on consumption behavior'

description: Six studies examined whether energy labeling affects alcohol consumption behavior, but found
  no evidence of beneficial effect. However, evidence quality is very low due to methodological limitations
  - no real-world studies, proxy outcomes, and low quality designs create high uncertainty about true
  policy effects.

  equity_implications: The lack of evidence for behavioral effects should not be interpreted as policy
    failure, but as evidence gap. Structural interventions like labeling address information asymmetries
    created by industry practices and regulatory gaps. The absence of real-world studies reflects research
    infrastructure limitations, not necessarily policy ineffectiveness. Further research in naturalistic
    settings is needed before drawing conclusions.
