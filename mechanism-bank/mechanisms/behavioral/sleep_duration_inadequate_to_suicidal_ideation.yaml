direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate sleep duration and sleep disturbances disrupt normal neurobiological
  processes, including prefrontal cortex function and emotional regulation centers'
- 'Step 2: Impaired sleep leads to dysregulation of mood, increased emotional reactivity,
  and reduced cognitive capacity for problem-solving and coping'
- 'Step 3: Chronic sleep disturbances amplify negative affect, hopelessness, and impair
  impulse control, increasing vulnerability to suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: The accumulation of sleep-related cognitive and emotional deficits manifests
  as increased suicidal thoughts and ideation in affected adolescents'

description: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 studies involving over 1.1
  million adolescents demonstrates that sleep disturbances are significantly associated
  with suicidal ideation. Adolescents with sleep disturbances are 2.28 times more
  likely to experience suicidal ideation compared to controls without sleep disturbances.
  This association was observed across multiple countries and persisted in adolescents
  without diagnosed psychiatric disorders, suggesting sleep disturbances as an independent
  risk factor.
