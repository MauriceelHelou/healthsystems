to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Attractive alcohol advertising increases positive attitudes toward alcohol among young people'
- 'Step 2: Perceived image benefits from advertising (social status, attractiveness, fun) create aspirational
  drinking motivations'
- 'Step 3: Higher perceived behavioral impact indicates greater likelihood of advertising influencing
  drinking decisions'
- 'Step 4: Increased motivation and positive associations contribute to initiation and escalation of alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 5: Pattern of heavier drinking including binge drinking may develop, particularly in vulnerable
  young adult populations'

description: This mechanism links alcohol advertising appeal to downstream drinking behaviors. While the
  study measured proximate outcomes (advertising reactions and perceived behavioral impact), these are
  established precursors to actual drinking behavior. The finding that young women and those aged 18-21
  are most sensitive to contextual advertising suggests these groups face heightened risk of advertising-influenced
  alcohol consumption patterns.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism traces alcohol consumption patterns to commercial determinants
    rather than individual choice. Young people, particularly women and those 18-21, are structurally
    vulnerable to alcohol marketing due to developmental factors and social pressures. Policy responses
    like content restrictions address this structural vulnerability rather than placing burden on individuals
    to resist marketing. The equity implications are significant: without content restrictions, alcohol
    industry marketing disproportionately influences the most vulnerable young adult populations.'
