- 'Step 1: Light-to-moderate alcohol consumption among individuals with established NAFLD'
- 'Step 2: Potential attenuation of metabolic dysfunction or inflammatory processes at low doses'
- 'Step 3: Reduced progression to end-stage liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma'
- 'Step 4: Lower liver-related mortality in NAFLD population'

  in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, addressing the unclear relationship between modest
  drinking and death in this population.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Mortality disparities in liver disease are structured by access to hepatology specialists,
    ability to afford medications, healthcare insurance status, and proximity to transplant centers. Socioeconomic
    status influences both NAFLD risk factors (diet, physical activity) and drinking patterns. Public
    health messaging about 'safe' alcohol levels must account for population-level harms even if individual-level
    associations appear protective.
