direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smartphone-delivered ApBM training targets automatic approach tendencies toward alcohol cues'
- 'Step 2: Repeated training retrains implicit cognitive biases that drive automatic alcohol-seeking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Reduced approach bias decreases automatic motivation to consume alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Individuals experience reduced urge to drink in response to alcohol-related stimuli'
- 'Step 5: Overall weekly alcohol consumption decreases'

description: This pilot RCT tested a smartphone-delivered alcohol approach bias modification (ApBM) intervention
  for middle-older adults (≥55 years) with hazardous/harmful drinking. While both intervention and sham
  groups showed significant reductions in weekly standard drinks (6.9 drinks overall reduction, p<.001),
  there was no significant group-by-time interaction at the 4-week endpoint (β=-1.90, p=.43). However,
  a significant treatment effect favoring ApBM was observed at 2 weeks (β=-5.28, p=.03), suggesting potential
  acute benefit that may not persist.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This intervention addresses alcohol consumption at the individual behavioral level
    through cognitive retraining, representing a technology-based approach to extending treatment access.
    The smartphone delivery mechanism has potential to address healthcare access barriers for older adults
    who may face mobility limitations or live in areas with limited substance use treatment services.
    However, the mechanism primarily targets individual-level cognitive processes rather than structural
    determinants of alcohol misuse such as alcohol outlet density, marketing exposure, or social determinants.
    The focus on middle-older adults acknowledges demographic shifts in problematic drinking patterns.
    Equity considerations include digital access barriers that may disproportionately affect lower-income
    older adults.
