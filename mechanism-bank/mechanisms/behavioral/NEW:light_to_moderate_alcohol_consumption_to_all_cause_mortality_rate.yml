description: This meta-analysis addresses the unclear impact of light-to-moderate alcohol on overall mortality
  in patients with NAFLD, a population at increased risk of both liver and cardiovascular death.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The J-shaped curve hypothesis for alcohol and mortality remains contested and may
    reflect confounding by socioeconomic factors. Former drinkers (often grouped with abstainers) may
    have quit due to illness, biasing comparisons. Policy implications must consider that promoting any
    alcohol consumption could increase population-level harm, particularly in communities already burdened
    by alcohol-related morbidity. Structural factors including alcohol industry marketing, pricing policies,
    and outlet density shape consumption patterns independent of individual choice.
