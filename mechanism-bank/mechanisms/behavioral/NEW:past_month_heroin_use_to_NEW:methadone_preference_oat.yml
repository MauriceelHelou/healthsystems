  node_name: Preference for Methadone as OAT
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Active heroin use involves full opioid agonist pharmacology'
- 'Step 2: Methadone as a full agonist provides more complete receptor coverage than partial agonist buprenorphine'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with higher tolerance from active use may perceive methadone as more effective
  for managing withdrawal and cravings'
- 'Step 4: Preference reflects pharmacological alignment with current opioid use patterns'

description: Past month heroin use was independently associated with 78% higher odds of preferring methadone
  over buprenorphine for OAT, suggesting current drug use patterns influence treatment preferences.

  equity_implications: This finding underscores the importance of matching treatment options to individual
    needs rather than applying standardized protocols. Healthcare systems should offer diverse OAT options
    that account for varying levels of opioid dependence severity and current use patterns.
