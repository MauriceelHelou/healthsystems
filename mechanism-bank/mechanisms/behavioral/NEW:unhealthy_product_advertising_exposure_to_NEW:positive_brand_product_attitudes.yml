direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young people (ages 6-17) are exposed to abundant advertising for unhealthy products including
  alcohol, tobacco, and unhealthy foods'
- 'Step 2: Advertising generates positive emotional associations and brand familiarity regardless of cognitive
  understanding of persuasive intent'
- 'Step 3: Both digital and non-digital advertising formats effectively influence attitudes'
- 'Step 4: Greater understanding of advertising intent does not protect against attitude formation'
- 'Step 5: Positive brand/product attitudes develop that may predispose to future consumption behaviors'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 studies finding that exposure to advertising for
  unhealthy products (alcohol, tobacco, unhealthy foods) generates more positive brand and product attitudes
  in young people aged 6-17, compared to neutral or no advertising. Critically, greater understanding
  of advertising persuasive intent did not protect against these effects, challenging regulatory assumptions
  that adolescents can resist advertising influence.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural failure in advertising regulation policy.
    Current policies often exempt adolescents from marketing restrictions based on the assumption that
    developed critical reasoning provides protection. This review demonstrates this assumption is unfounded
    - adolescent cognition remains vulnerable to advertising influence despite understanding persuasive
    intent. The structural intervention point is extending marketing restrictions for unhealthy commodities
    (alcohol, tobacco, unhealthy foods) to protect adolescents, not just younger children. This avoids
    blaming individual adolescents for 'failing to resist' advertising and instead focuses on the commercial
    determinants of health.
