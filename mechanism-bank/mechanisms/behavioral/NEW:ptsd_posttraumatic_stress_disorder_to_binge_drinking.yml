mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PTSD produces acute episodes of symptom exacerbation including flashbacks and hyperarousal'
- 'Step 2: Acute distress drives immediate need for symptom relief'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol consumption provides short-term anxiolytic effects and emotional numbing'
- 'Step 4: Binge drinking episodes occur as attempt to rapidly suppress severe symptom flares'
- 'Step 5: Pattern of heavy episodic drinking becomes reinforced through negative reinforcement'

description: PTSD symptoms drive problematic alcohol use patterns including binge drinking through the
  self-medication pathway. The review found evidence supporting this relationship though notes methodological
  limitations in the existing literature.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Binge drinking as self-medication reflects both the severity of untreated PTSD
    symptoms and structural barriers to appropriate mental health care. Alcohol accessibility, social
    norms around drinking, and inadequate trauma treatment infrastructure all create conditions where
    self-medication becomes a more accessible coping strategy than professional treatment.
