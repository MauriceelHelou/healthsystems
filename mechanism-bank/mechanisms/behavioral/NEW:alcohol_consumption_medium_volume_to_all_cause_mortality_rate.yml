mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medium-volume alcohol consumption patterns established in population'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes cumulative organ damage (liver, cardiovascular, neurological)'
- 'Step 3: Dose-response relationship emerges with increasing consumption levels'
- 'Step 4: All-cause mortality risk increases monotonically with consumption volume'

description: Medium-volume alcohol consumption is associated with 13% increased all-cause mortality risk
  (RR=1.13) compared to occasional drinking in the methodologically rigorous low-risk-of-bias review.
quantitative_effects:
  effect_size:
    value: 1.13
    type: relative_risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The monotonic dose-response relationship challenges structural messaging and policies
    that normalize 'moderate' drinking. This has implications for alcohol taxation, availability policies,
    and public health messaging.
