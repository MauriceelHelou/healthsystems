mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: E-cigarette use establishes patterns of substance use in adolescence'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine affects reward circuitry and may enhance rewarding properties of alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Social settings promoting e-cigarette use often normalize heavy drinking behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Common underlying vulnerabilities and risk environments contribute to both behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Escalation to binge drinking/drunkenness patterns occurs among e-cigarette users'

  to non-users. This high-risk drinking pattern association was even stronger among high school students.

  description: High school ECIG users showed higher odds of binge drinking/drunkenness (OR 7.98, 95% CI
    5.98-10.63) compared to overall pooled estimate
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The strong association between e-cigarette use and binge drinking highlights the
    need for comprehensive policies addressing youth access to both products. Structural determinants
    include marketing environments, retail density of both products, and school/community prevention infrastructure.
    The findings support integrated policy approaches rather than siloed interventions. Equity implications
    include differential exposure based on community resources for prevention.
