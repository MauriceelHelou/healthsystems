mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with AUD entering treatment have diverse baseline characteristics'
- 'Step 2: Treatment produces heterogeneous outcomes along multiple dimensions (drinking, functioning,
  mental health)'
- 'Step 3: Latent profile analysis reveals four distinct recovery profiles at 3-year follow-up'
- 'Step 4: Recovery heterogeneity challenges unitary definitions of recovery based solely on abstinence'

description: 'AUD treatment produces heterogeneous recovery outcomes identifiable as four distinct latent
  profiles: poor functioning frequent heavy drinkers, poor functioning infrequent heavy drinkers, high
  functioning occasional heavy drinkers, and high-functioning infrequent non-heavy drinkers.'

  equity_implications: The identification of multiple recovery profiles challenges the dominant abstinence-only
    paradigm in AUD treatment. This has implications for treatment access and coverage policies that may
    require abstinence as a condition of continued support. Recognizing diverse valid recovery pathways
    could expand treatment options for marginalized populations.
