direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MET provides motivational interviewing-based treatment over four sessions for individuals with
  AUD'
- 'Step 2: Therapy enhances intrinsic motivation to change drinking behavior through empathetic, non-confrontational
  approach'
- 'Step 3: Patients develop increased self-efficacy and resolve ambivalence about changing alcohol consumption
  patterns'
- 'Step 4: Sustained reduction in weekly alcohol consumption occurs as motivation translates to behavioral
  change'

description: MET substantially reduced weekly alcohol consumption among individuals with AUD seeking controlled
  drinking, with no significant difference from BSCT at 26-week follow-up for the primary outcome measure

  description: Primary outcome was adjusted for baseline consumption, suggesting initial drinking levels
    moderate treatment effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The availability of evidence-based treatments like MET in specialized dependency
    care settings represents a structural facilitator of alcohol harm reduction. However, access to such
    specialized clinics is not equitably distributed, creating potential disparities in treatment access
    based on geography and healthcare system capacity.
