direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Physical activity during pregnancy increases glucose uptake by skeletal muscles through enhanced
  insulin sensitivity'
- 'Step 2: Regular exercise reduces adipose tissue accumulation and inflammatory markers associated with
  insulin resistance'
- 'Step 3: Improved glycemic control during early pregnancy prevents the metabolic dysregulation that
  leads to gestational diabetes mellitus'
- 'Step 4: Dose-response relationship shows progressive risk reduction with increased activity levels
  measured in MET-hours/week'

description: Higher levels of physical activity during pregnancy are associated with reduced risk of gestational
  diabetes mellitus, with a 36% risk reduction comparing highest to lowest activity levels. The relationship
  is dose-dependent and stronger during the first trimester.

  description: First trimester physical activity shows stronger protective effect (curvilinear relationship,
    13% reduction at 10 MET-h/week) compared to second trimester (linear relationship, 1% reduction at
    10 MET-h/week)

  strength: strong
  description: Higher doses of physical activity (20-50 MET-h/week) contribute to further reductions in
    GDM risk beyond the minimum recommended 10 MET-h/week
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on individual physical activity, structural factors
    determine access to safe exercise environments during pregnancy, including availability of prenatal
    exercise programs, workplace policies allowing physical activity breaks, neighborhood walkability,
    access to parks and recreational facilities, and economic resources for gym memberships or exercise
    equipment. Pregnant individuals in under-resourced communities may face barriers to achieving recommended
    activity levels due to unsafe neighborhoods, lack of time due to work demands, or absence of culturally
    appropriate prenatal fitness programs.
