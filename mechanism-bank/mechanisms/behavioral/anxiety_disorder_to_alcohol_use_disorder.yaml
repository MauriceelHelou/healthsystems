- 'Step 1: Individuals with anxiety/phobic disorders experience chronic psychological
  distress, worry, and physiological arousal'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol is used as a coping mechanism (self-medication) to reduce anxiety
  symptoms and achieve temporary relief from distress'

description: Individuals with anxiety/phobic disorders have nearly twice the odds
  of developing alcohol use disorder compared to those without these conditions. This
  meta-analysis of 17 studies with over 380,000 participants demonstrates a robust
  association (OR=1.94) between anxiety/phobic disorders and AUD, consistent with
  self-medication theory where alcohol is used to cope with anxiety symptoms.
