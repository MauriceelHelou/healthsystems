direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dissociation develops as a psychological response to childhood maltreatment
  and trauma, creating altered states of consciousness and detachment from emotions,
  thoughts, and bodily sensations'
- 'Step 2: Dissociative symptoms impair emotion regulation capacities and promote
  maladaptive coping strategies including withdrawal and self-blame'
- 'Step 3: Impaired emotional awareness and regulation during dissociative states
  reduce ability to recognize danger cues, set boundaries, or respond adaptively to
  conflict in intimate relationships'
- 'Step 4: Dissociation serves as a bridge symptom connecting trauma history to both
  IPV perpetration (through emotional disconnection enabling harmful behavior) and
  victimization (through reduced protective responses)'
- 'Step 5: The co-occurrence of dissociation with PTSD symptoms and maladaptive schemata
  (mistrust, alienation, enmeshment) further increases vulnerability to IPV involvement'

description: Dissociation functions as an important bridge symptom linking intimate
  partner violence to childhood maltreatment experiences, PTSD symptoms, and maladaptive
  coping. Network analysis revealed that when all psychological variables were included
  simultaneously, IPV was associated with dissociation, which indirectly connected
  it to trauma history, PTSD, withdrawal, and self-blame. Both IPV perpetration and
  victimization were highly correlated and associated with dissociation, suggesting
  dissociative processes may contribute to the cycle of violence in intimate relationships.
