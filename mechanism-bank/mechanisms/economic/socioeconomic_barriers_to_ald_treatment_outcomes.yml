mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low income and lack of insurance limit access to specialized ALD care'
- 'Step 2: Financial constraints prevent access to behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapeutic modalities'
- 'Step 3: Inability to afford nutrition support and dietary interventions'
- 'Step 4: Delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation due to cost barriers'
- 'Step 5: Poor disease progression and increased mortality from untreated ALD'

description: Socioeconomic barriers create systematic obstacles to accessing comprehensive ALD treatment,
  resulting in worse health outcomes through delayed and inadequate care.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights how economic inequality and healthcare financing systems
    create differential access to life-saving ALD treatments. The barrier is structural (healthcare system
    design, insurance coverage) rather than individual choice. Equity implication: Low-income populations
    face compounded disadvantage from both higher ALD risk and reduced treatment access.'
