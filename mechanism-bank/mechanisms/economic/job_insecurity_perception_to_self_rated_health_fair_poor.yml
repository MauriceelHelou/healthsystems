- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic causes organizational restructuring and negative economic consequences'
- 'Step 2: Workers perceive increased threat of job loss and employment instability'
- 'Step 3: Chronic uncertainty activates stress response systems and allostatic load'

  description: The review identified boundary conditions that alleviated job insecurity among workers
    and influenced both work and non-work outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism traces health outcomes to structural economic conditions (pandemic-induced
    labor market disruption) rather than individual behavior. Workers experiencing job insecurity are
    subject to forces beyond their control including organizational restructuring and macroeconomic shocks.
    Equity implications: precarious workers and those in sectors most affected by pandemic restrictions
    likely experienced greater exposure to job insecurity.'
