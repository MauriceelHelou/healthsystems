direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low childhood SES limits access to healthcare, nutrition, and safe environments during developmental
  periods'
- 'Step 2: Early life adversity creates vulnerability to chronic conditions and injuries'
- 'Step 3: Limited educational opportunities reduce knowledge and resources for health maintenance'
- 'Step 4: Interaction between childhood and adulthood SES moderates disability outcomes'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative life-course disadvantage results in higher disability rates in late adulthood'

description: Childhood socioeconomic status shows significant interaction with adulthood SES specifically
  for disability-related health outcomes, demonstrating heterogeneity in how early life conditions affect
  different health domains

  variation_notes: Study conducted in China with population aged 45 and older; disability-related outcomes
    showed unique interaction patterns compared to other health outcomes

  description: The association between disability-related health variables and adulthood SES is moderated
    by childhood SES; this interaction effect was significant only for disability outcomes among all health
    outcomes examined
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that disability outcomes show unique interaction patterns between childhood
    and adult SES suggests that functional health trajectories are particularly sensitive to cumulative
    structural disadvantage across the life course. This supports policies addressing both early-life
    conditions and adult opportunities.
