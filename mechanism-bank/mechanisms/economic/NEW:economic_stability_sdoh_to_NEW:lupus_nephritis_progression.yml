  node_id: NEW:lupus_nephritis_progression
  node_name: Lupus Nephritis Disease Progression
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic instability limits ability to afford medications, specialist visits, and transportation
  to care'
- 'Step 2: Financial stress contributes to chronic psychological stress and inflammatory burden'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate resources lead to suboptimal disease management and treatment adherence'
- 'Step 4: Disease activity remains uncontrolled leading to progressive kidney damage'

description: Economic stability as an SDoH domain contributes to lupus nephritis outcomes through mechanisms
  of affordability, access, and chronic stress

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Economic instability reflects structural inequities in wealth distribution, employment
    opportunities, and social safety nets rather than individual financial management. Policy interventions
    addressing medication affordability, insurance coverage, and income support could mitigate these effects.
