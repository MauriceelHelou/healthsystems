structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural economic conditions (precarious employment
    arrangements, weak labor protections) not only harm individual workers but also create organizational
    dysfunction. The productivity consequences suggest that structural job insecurity is counterproductive
    even from an organizational efficiency perspective, pointing to policy opportunities for improving
    employment security.
