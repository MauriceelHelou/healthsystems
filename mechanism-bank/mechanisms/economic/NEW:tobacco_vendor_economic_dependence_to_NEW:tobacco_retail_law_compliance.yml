  equity_implications: 'This finding has important policy implications: if vendors are not heavily economically
    dependent on tobacco sales, regulatory enforcement may face less resistance than anticipated. Policy
    approaches should leverage this finding while still providing transition support for vendors who are
    economically dependent.'
