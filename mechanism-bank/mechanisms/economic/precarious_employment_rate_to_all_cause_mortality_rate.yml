mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persistent precarious employment limits access to employer-sponsored health insurance and benefits'
- 'Step 2: Reduced healthcare access delays diagnosis and treatment of chronic conditions'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from job insecurity accelerates biological aging and cardiovascular risk'
- 'Step 4: Income volatility reduces capacity for health-promoting investments (nutrition, housing, safety)'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative health disadvantage across multiple pathways may increase mortality risk'

description: The association between persistent precarious employment and all-cause mortality was imprecisely
  estimated (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.91-1.33), with confidence interval crossing null. The authors note that
  associations were smaller for outcomes with longer time lags, suggesting mortality effects may require
  longer follow-up or larger samples to detect.

  description: Mortality has longer time lag from exposure to outcome, which may explain weaker and more
    imprecise estimates compared to mental health outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism, while showing uncertain effects, appropriately conceptualizes mortality
    as a downstream consequence of employment structures. The imprecision may reflect methodological challenges
    in detecting long-latency effects rather than absence of causal impact. The framing appropriately
    avoids individualizing blame and maintains focus on structural employment conditions as modifiable
    determinants.
