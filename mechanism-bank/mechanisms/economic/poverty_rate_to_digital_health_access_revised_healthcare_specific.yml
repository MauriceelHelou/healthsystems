  equity_implications: This mechanism traces health technology adoption barriers to economic structures
    rather than individual choices. Lower-income older adults face compounded disadvantages as healthcare
    increasingly requires digital access. Policy solutions include device subsidies, broadband programs,
    and public access points.
