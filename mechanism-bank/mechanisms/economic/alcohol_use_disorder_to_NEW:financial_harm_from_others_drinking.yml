direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individual''s alcohol use disorder leads to excessive spending on alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 2: Household financial resources are diverted from essential expenses to alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Family members experience reduced money available for household expenses'
- 'Step 4: Financial trouble emerges for those connected to the drinker through shared resources'

description: This multi-country study demonstrates that alcohol consumption by individuals creates financial
  harm for others in their social network, particularly affecting household economics through reduced
  money for expenses and financial trouble. The burden falls disproportionately on women and those in
  lower-income countries.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Under 3.2% in most high-income countries reported financial harm, whereas 12-22% reported
    financial harm in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India. Low- and middle-income countries show significantly
    higher prevalence than high-income countries.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how alcohol-related harms extend beyond the individual
    drinker to affect household economic security of connected persons. The disproportionate impact on
    women reflects gendered economic vulnerabilities within households, where women may have less control
    over household finances yet bear the consequences of partners' drinking. The stark differences between
    high-income and low-middle-income countries reflect structural economic conditions including weaker
    social safety nets, lower baseline incomes, and potentially different household resource allocation
    patterns.
