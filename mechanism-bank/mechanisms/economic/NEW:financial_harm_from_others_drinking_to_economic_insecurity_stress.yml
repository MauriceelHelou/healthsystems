direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Financial harm from a drinker''s behavior reduces available household resources'
- 'Step 2: Affected household members experience financial trouble and constrained spending'
- 'Step 3: Economic insecurity leads to chronic stress about meeting basic needs'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged economic stress affects mental and physical health outcomes'

description: Financial harm from others' drinking creates downstream economic insecurity and associated
  stress, with effects varying substantially by national economic context. The pathway from alcohol-related
  financial harm to stress is structurally mediated by country-level factors.

  variation_notes: Prevalence ranges from under 3.2% in high-income countries to 12-22% in Thailand, Sri
    Lanka, and India, suggesting economic context moderates the pathway from financial harm to stress

    financial harm from others' drinking
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism avoids blaming individual drinkers by situating the harm within
    structural economic contexts. The finding that low- and middle-income country residents experience
    far higher rates of financial harm reflects structural vulnerabilities including income inequality,
    lack of social protections, and economic precarity that amplify individual-level drinking behaviors
    into population-level harms. Women's disproportionate burden reflects gendered power structures within
    households and economies.
