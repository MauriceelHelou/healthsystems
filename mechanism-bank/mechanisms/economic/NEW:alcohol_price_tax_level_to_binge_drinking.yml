direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol taxes and prices increase the cost of purchasing alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Increased costs reduce affordability and purchasing power for alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced affordability leads to decreased alcohol consumption, including heavy drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption rates result in reduced binge drinking prevalence across populations'

description: A meta-analysis of 112 studies found a significant elasticity of -0.28 for heavy drinking
  in response to alcohol prices, demonstrating that increases in alcohol prices and taxes are associated
  with reduced binge drinking. This economic mechanism operates through affordability constraints that
  reduce purchasing and consumption of alcohol.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on population-level policy interventions (taxation) rather
    than individual behavior change. It demonstrates how economic policy levers can reduce harmful drinking
    patterns structurally. The evidence shows effects across demographic groups including youth, heavy
    drinkers, and those with alcohol use disorders, suggesting universal benefit from price-based policies.
    This approach avoids blaming individuals for alcohol problems and instead addresses the structural
    economic accessibility of alcohol.
