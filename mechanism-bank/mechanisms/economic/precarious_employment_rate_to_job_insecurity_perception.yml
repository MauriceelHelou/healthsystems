- 'Step 1: Labor market policies and employer practices create contingent, temporary, and unstable work
  arrangements'
- 'Step 2: Workers in precarious employment face objective threats to job continuity'
- 'Step 3: Awareness of replaceability and limited protections heightens subjective insecurity'
- 'Step 4: Both quantitative (losing job) and qualitative (losing job features) insecurity increase'
- 'Step 5: Widespread job insecurity perceptions emerge across precarious workforce'

description: Precarious employment arrangements are structural antecedents to job insecurity perceptions,
  demonstrating how labor market policies and employer practices create conditions for worker stress and
  performance decrements.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly links structural labor market conditions to individual-level
    insecurity perceptions. It avoids blaming workers for feeling insecure and instead traces the root
    cause to employment policy and employer practices. Equity implications include disproportionate exposure
    of low-wage workers, women, minorities, and young workers to precarious arrangements.
