direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol prices/taxes increase the financial cost of purchasing alcoholic
  beverages'
- 'Step 2: Increased costs reduce alcohol consumption, including heavy and binge drinking
  patterns (price elasticity of -0.28 for heavy drinking)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced heavy and excessive drinking decreases cumulative alcohol exposure
  and acute intoxication episodes'
- 'Step 4: Lower alcohol exposure reduces incidence of alcohol-attributable diseases
  (e.g., cirrhosis) and injuries (e.g., accidents, violence)'

description: 'Higher alcohol prices and taxes are inversely associated with alcohol-related
  disease and injury outcomes. This relationship operates through reduced alcohol
  consumption at higher price points, with a meta-analysis of 112 studies estimating
  a significant heavy drinking elasticity of -0.28. A separate meta-analysis specifically
  demonstrated that increased taxes and prices were associated with reduced alcohol-related
  disease and injury outcomes attributable to binge drinking. Experimental studies
  in barroom settings confirm the causal direction: when prices decrease, consumption
  increases.'
