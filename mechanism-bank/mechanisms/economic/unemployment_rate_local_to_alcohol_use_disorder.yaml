direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Job loss or unemployment creates economic stress and financial uncertainty
  at the individual level'
- 'Step 2: Unemployment triggers psychological distress including stress, depression,
  and anxiety due to loss of income, social status, and daily structure'
- 'Step 3: Individuals may turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism to manage negative
  emotional states and psychological distress'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol consumption over time can lead to patterns of binge drinking
  and eventual alcohol dependency or alcohol use disorder diagnosis'
- 'Step 5: Note: Long-term unemployment (>1 year) may paradoxically reduce consumption
  due to severe financial constraints limiting ability to purchase alcohol'

description: Unemployment positively impacts alcohol consumption, binge drinking,
  and alcohol addiction/dependency diagnosis. The relationship operates through psychological
  mechanisms where job loss creates stress and mental health problems that increase
  vulnerability to problematic drinking. However, the relationship is moderated by
  unemployment duration, with very long-term unemployment potentially reducing consumption
  due to financial constraints.
