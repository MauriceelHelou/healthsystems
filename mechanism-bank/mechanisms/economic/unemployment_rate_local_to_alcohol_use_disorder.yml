mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Census-level unemployment reflects area-level economic disadvantage and job scarcity'
- 'Step 2: High neighborhood unemployment may create stress and limited opportunities for residents'
- 'Step 3: Economic instability and lack of structured activity could increase vulnerability to problematic
  drinking'
- 'Step 4: However, no significant indirect effects through collective efficacy were found in this study'

description: The study tested whether census-level unemployment affected AUD through collective efficacy.
  Census-level unemployment had no direct influence on collective efficacy, and no indirect effects on
  alcohol outcomes were found.

  variation_notes: Study specific to San Juan, Puerto Rico; census-level unemployment had no direct influence
    on collective efficacy
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The inclusion of area-level unemployment demonstrates appropriate structural framing
    of economic determinants. The null findings suggest that in the Puerto Rican context, neighborhood
    unemployment may operate through different pathways than hypothesized, or that other structural factors
    may be more salient determinants of alcohol outcomes.
