direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Income inequality creates unequal distribution of resources across populations,
  concentrating wealth and opportunity in smaller segments'
- 'Step 2: Unequal resource distribution reduces access to health-promoting resources
  (healthcare, healthy food, safe housing) for those in lower income brackets'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from social comparison and relative deprivation in unequal
  societies impacts physiological and psychological well-being'
- 'Step 4: Combined material deprivation and psychosocial stress pathways contribute
  to poorer perceived health status'
