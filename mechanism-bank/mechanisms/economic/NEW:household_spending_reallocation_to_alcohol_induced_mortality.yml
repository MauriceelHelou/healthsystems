mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Consumer preferences shift away from alcohol consumption (tastes-induced change)'
- 'Step 2: Household spending reallocates from alcohol to other goods and services'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption at population level'
- 'Step 4: Improved health outcomes due to lower alcohol exposure'

description: When consumers voluntarily reduce alcohol consumption through preference changes, spending
  reallocates to other sectors. While this produces health benefits, the study finds some trade-off with
  employment (unlike the taxation scenario), though the trade-off is less severe than previously estimated

  description: The economic impact depends on which sectors receive reallocated household spending; some
    sectors may have higher employment multipliers than alcohol
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how consumption patterns are embedded in broader economic
    systems. Changes in preferences, potentially driven by public health campaigns or social norm shifts,
    have cascading effects through the economy. The finding that economic trade-offs are less severe than
    past analyses suggest challenges arguments used to oppose alcohol reduction efforts.
