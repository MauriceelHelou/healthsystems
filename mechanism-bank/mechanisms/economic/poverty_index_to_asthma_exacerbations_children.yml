direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High neighborhood poverty concentrates multiple environmental and social stressors'
- 'Step 2: Poor families have limited resources for asthma medications, air filtration, and healthcare'
- 'Step 3: Neighborhood disinvestment creates poor air quality, substandard housing, and limited healthcare
  access'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to poverty-related stressors overwhelms families'' coping capacity'
- 'Step 5: Multiple pathways converge to increase asthma exacerbation rates in high-poverty areas'

description: Concentrated neighborhood poverty creates multiple pathways to increased asthma exacerbations
  through environmental exposures, limited resources, and cumulative stress.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects demonstrate spatial clustering of poverty and asthma exacerbations in South
    Side Chicago neighborhoods
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects how structural economic inequalities create health disparities.
    Concentrated poverty results from historical redlining, discriminatory lending, employment discrimination,
    and policy choices about minimum wage, housing, and social safety nets. Neighborhood poverty is a
    policy outcome, not a reflection of individual characteristics. Addresses fundamental cause theory
    - poverty creates multiple pathways to poor health outcomes.
