description: The abstract explicitly identifies happy hours and alcohol price promotions as contributors
  to heavy drinking among college students. These pricing structures represent commercial and social environment
  policies that increase alcohol accessibility. The study's behavioral economic framework demonstrates
  how pricing strategies influence consumption decisions at the population level.

  description: States with happy hour bans may reduce exposure to promotional pricing, though off-campus
    parties may circumvent commercial regulations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately identifies commercial pricing policies as structural
    determinants of drinking patterns. Happy hour bans represent a policy lever that some jurisdictions
    have used to address this. The focus on the pricing environment rather than individual responsibility
    aligns with structural competency principles. However, as the study shows, off-campus party pricing
    operates outside commercial regulation, suggesting policy gaps that may disproportionately affect
    college communities.
