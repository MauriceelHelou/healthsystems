- 'Step 1: Job loss or unemployment creates psychological distress including stress,
  anxiety, and depression due to financial insecurity and loss of social identity'
- 'Step 2: Unemployed individuals may turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism to manage
  negative emotions and psychological distress'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol consumption manifests as binge drinking episodes, with
  this relationship remaining consistent across various robustness tests'
- 'Step 4: However, prolonged unemployment (>1 year) may eventually reduce alcohol
  consumption due to financial constraints limiting purchasing ability'

description: Unemployment has a positive and substantial impact on binge drinking
  behaviors. The relationship operates through psychological distress pathways, where
  job loss triggers stress and depression that individuals may cope with through increased
  alcohol consumption. Panel data analysis with fixed effects confirms this positive
  relationship remains robust across various sensitivity analyses. However, the relationship
  may be moderated by duration of unemployment, with very long-term unemployment potentially
  reducing consumption due to financial constraints.
