direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher national GDP reflects longer-term economic development and demographic transitions'
- 'Step 2: More developed economies have aging PWID populations who initiated use in earlier decades'
- 'Step 3: Economic development may be associated with harm reduction keeping PWID alive longer'
- 'Step 4: Older median age of PWID population reflects survival and established drug use epidemics'

description: Higher GDP per capita at the country level is associated with older median age of people
  who inject drugs, with each $1000 GDP increase corresponding to 0.13 years older median age.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Substantial regional variation observed; regions with younger PWID populations (e.g.,
    eastern Europe at 43.4% aged ≤25) had low coverage of blood-borne virus prevention interventions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: National wealth and economic development shape the demographics of drug-using populations
    through structural forces including healthcare access, survival rates, and historical patterns of
    drug market development. This is not about individual choice but macroeconomic determinants.
