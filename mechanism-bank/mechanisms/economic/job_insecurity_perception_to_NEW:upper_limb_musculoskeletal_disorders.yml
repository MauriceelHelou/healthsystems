mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Perceived threat of job loss creates sustained psychological distress'
- 'Step 2: Stress-induced muscle tension particularly affects upper extremities used in repetitive work
  tasks'
- 'Step 3: Workers may increase work intensity or accept unfavorable conditions to maintain employment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced recovery time and increased physical demands compound stress-related tissue vulnerability'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative strain results in upper limb musculoskeletal pathology'

description: The systematic review specifically identified upper limbs as one of the body areas most affected
  by the association between job insecurity and musculoskeletal disorders, reflecting how psychosocial
  work stress translates into region-specific physical pathology.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Upper limb disorders are often prevalent in occupations with repetitive manual
    tasks, which tend to have higher rates of precarious employment. This creates compounded vulnerability
    where workers in structurally disadvantaged positions face both job insecurity stress and physical
    demands. Policy interventions addressing employment security could reduce this health burden.
