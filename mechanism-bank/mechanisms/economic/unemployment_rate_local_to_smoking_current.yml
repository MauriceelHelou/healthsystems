mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unemployment creates economic hardship and loss of employer-sponsored resources'
- 'Step 2: Financial stress and uncertainty generate chronic psychological distress'
- 'Step 3: Loss of workplace social networks reduces access to health-promoting social norms'
- 'Step 4: Smoking serves as stress-coping mechanism and may be more accessible than other coping resources'
- 'Step 5: Reduced access to smoking cessation programs (often employer-sponsored) limits quit attempts'

description: Unemployment increases the likelihood of smoking by 43%. This systematic review and meta-analysis
  of 52 studies demonstrates a stronger association between unemployment and smoking compared to alcohol
  use. The mechanism reflects how economic instability drives tobacco use as a stress-coping behavior
  while simultaneously reducing access to cessation resources typically provided through employment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism traces smoking behavior to its structural economic roots rather
    than framing it as purely individual choice. Unemployed populations face compounded disadvantage:
    greater stress driving tobacco use plus reduced access to employer-sponsored health programs and cessation
    support. Policy implications include maintaining health insurance during unemployment, expanding public
    cessation programs, and addressing root causes of unemployment. The finding that unemployment has
    even stronger effects on smoking (OR 1.43) than alcohol (OR 1.25) suggests tobacco-specific vulnerabilities
    in unemployed populations.'
