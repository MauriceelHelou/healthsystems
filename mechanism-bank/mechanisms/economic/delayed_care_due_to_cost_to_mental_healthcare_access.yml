- 'Step 1: Despite Canada''s universal healthcare funding model, mental health services face funding shortfalls'
- 'Step 2: Many mental health services (therapy, counseling) are not fully covered under provincial health
  plans'
- 'Step 3: Out-of-pocket costs for mental health treatment create financial barriers'
- 'Step 4: Emerging adults, often with limited financial resources, are unable to afford needed care'
- 'Step 5: Economic barriers prevent access to mental healthcare services'

description: Cost acts as a barrier to mental healthcare access for emerging adults despite Canada's universal
  healthcare model, due to funding shortfalls and incomplete coverage of mental health services

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how even universal healthcare systems can create inequitable
    access when mental health services are underfunded. The barrier is structural and policy-related,
    not a matter of individual financial planning. Policy solutions include expanding coverage and increasing
    mental health funding allocations.
