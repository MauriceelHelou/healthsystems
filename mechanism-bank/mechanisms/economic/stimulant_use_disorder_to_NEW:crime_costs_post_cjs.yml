mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-CJS methamphetamine use represents untreated substance use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Without intervention during CJS contact, addiction-related behaviors continue post-release'
- 'Step 3: Continued criminal activity related to drug use generates law enforcement, court, and incarceration
  costs'
- 'Step 4: Higher crime costs reflect both recidivism and severity of offenses'

description: Pre-CJS methamphetamine use is associated with higher crime costs after criminal justice
  system contact. This economic burden reflects the failure to adequately address substance use disorders
  within the CJS, resulting in continued criminal activity and associated societal costs.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Higher crime costs associated with untreated methamphetamine use represent a structural
    failure and misallocation of resources. Investment in treatment during CJS contact could reduce these
    downstream costs while improving individual health outcomes. This reflects broader systemic issues
    of criminalizing addiction rather than treating it as a health condition.
