description: Recent job loss increases binge drinking prevalence through a stress-coping
  mechanism. Job loss creates immediate economic stress and psychological distress,
  leading individuals to use alcohol as a maladaptive coping strategy. The effect
  is dose-dependent, with multiple job losses showing stronger associations with excessive
  drinking, and appears consistent across different populations and age groups.
structural_competency_notes: The pathway is exacerbated by structural factors including
  inadequate social safety nets, limited access to mental health services, and socioeconomic
  disadvantage. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds show stronger associations
  between unemployment and substance use, suggesting that structural inequalities
  amplify the stress-drinking pathway.
