mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-campus parties offer refillable cups allowing unlimited alcohol access for a single price'
- 'Step 2: Lower cup prices (≤$5) result in 75%+ likelihood of purchase, creating high accessibility'
- 'Step 3: The ''bottomless cup'' model eliminates per-drink cost barriers, encouraging continued consumption'
- 'Step 4: Maximum expenditure willingness predicts both alcohol consumption quantity and alcohol-related
  consequences'
- 'Step 5: Higher prices ($10+) reduce purchase probability to ~47%, potentially limiting consumption'

description: This study demonstrates that pricing structures at unregulated off-campus college parties
  function as a structural determinant of binge drinking. The 'bottomless cup' model, where a single payment
  grants unlimited refills, removes ongoing cost barriers to consumption. Behavioral economic analysis
  shows that cup prices below $5 maintain high purchase probability (75%+), while prices at $10 reduce
  participation to 47%. The structural availability and pricing of alcohol in unregulated settings shapes
  consumption patterns independently of individual intentions.

  description: At cup prices of $10, purchase probability drops from 75% to approximately 47%, suggesting
    price thresholds that significantly reduce demand

  description: Higher maximum expenditure on CPPT uniquely predicts greater alcohol consumption and consequences
    beyond other behavioral economic measures
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately focuses on the structural pricing environment rather
    than blaming individual students for drinking. The study identifies how economic incentive structures
    at unregulated parties promote heavy drinking. Equity implications include that students with fewer
    financial resources may be more price-sensitive, while the unregulated nature of off-campus parties
    represents a gap in institutional alcohol policy coverage. Addressing this requires structural interventions
    targeting party economics and regulation, not individual behavior change campaigns.
