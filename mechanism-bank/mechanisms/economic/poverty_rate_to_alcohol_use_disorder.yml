- 'Step 1: High census-tract poverty concentration creates structural disadvantage in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Poverty-associated stressors including economic insecurity and limited resources increase psychosocial
  distress'
- 'Step 3: Elevated chronic stress may promote alcohol use as a coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Sustained problematic drinking patterns increase risk of developing alcohol use disorder'

description: Census-level poverty is associated with increased lifetime alcohol use disorder among women
  in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The study found that women living in high poverty neighborhoods had higher
  rates of lifetime AUD, though collective efficacy did not mediate this relationship.

  description: Women residing in high poverty areas reported higher rates of lifetime AUD, indicating
    gender-specific vulnerability to poverty-related alcohol outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately identifies poverty as a structural determinant operating
    at the census-tract level rather than blaming individual choices. The finding highlights how neighborhood-level
    economic disadvantage creates differential exposure to AUD risk, particularly for women. The study
    explicitly tests structural pathways through collective efficacy, though this mediation was not supported.
