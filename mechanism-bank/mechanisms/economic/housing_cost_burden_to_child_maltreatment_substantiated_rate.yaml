direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing cost burden (unaffordability) creates material hardship where families
  struggle to meet basic needs while paying for housing'
- 'Step 2: Financial stress from housing costs depletes household resources, reducing
  capacity for adequate child supervision, nutrition, and care'
- 'Step 3: Chronic economic stress increases caregiver psychological distress, reducing
  parental coping capacity and increasing risk of harsh parenting or neglect'
- 'Step 4: Housing stress may lead to housing instability, frequent moves, or inadequate
  housing conditions that compromise child safety'
- 'Step 5: These accumulated stressors increase likelihood of child maltreatment,
  which when reported and investigated leads to substantiated CPS reports'

description: This systematic review of 21 U.S. studies found consistent evidence that
  housing stress, including housing unaffordability/cost burden, is associated with
  increased likelihood of child maltreatment across multiple outcome measures including
  CPS reports, investigated and substantiated CPS reports, out-of-home placements,
  and maltreatment death. Housing unaffordability represents a form of material hardship
  that serves as a more proximal measure of how poverty affects daily family functioning
  than income alone.
