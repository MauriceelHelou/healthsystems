direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: RRT requires significant time commitment for treatment sessions, medical appointments, and
  recovery'
- 'Step 2: Physical limitations and fatigue from kidney disease reduce work capacity'
- 'Step 3: Employer accommodation for flexible scheduling may be limited or unavailable'
- 'Step 4: Educational disruption during childhood kidney disease may limit credential attainment'
- 'Step 5: Young adults on RRT face structural barriers to workforce participation resulting in higher
  unemployment'

    for young chronic disease patients. This perpetuates economic insecurity and health inequities.
