direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Financial assistance programs provide direct economic support to individuals with behavioral
  health conditions'
- 'Step 2: Reduced economic stress alleviates anxiety and cognitive burden associated with financial insecurity'
- 'Step 3: Basic needs (housing, food, utilities) are more reliably met, reducing competing demands'
- 'Step 4: Improved material security supports engagement with treatment and recovery activities'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced psychosocial functioning including social relationships, housing stability, and quality
  of life'

description: Financial assistance interventions showed weaker evidence for improving psychosocial outcomes
  among individuals with mental or substance use disorders. This reflects the potential for material support
  to address upstream determinants of behavioral health but requires further research.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism directly addresses the social determinants of health framework by
    recognizing that behavioral health conditions are exacerbated by poverty and economic insecurity.
    Financial assistance targets root causes rather than individual behaviors. The weaker evidence base
    may reflect methodological challenges in studying these interventions rather than lack of effect.
