direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited access to family planning services and contraception leads to unplanned pregnancies'
- 'Step 2: Women with unplanned pregnancies may not recognize pregnancy early or may delay prenatal care'
- 'Step 3: Delayed pregnancy recognition results in continued pre-pregnancy behaviors including alcohol
  use'
- 'Step 4: Psychological distress from unplanned pregnancy may contribute to continued or increased alcohol
  consumption'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural failures in reproductive health infrastructure,
    including limited access to contraception, family planning education, and early pregnancy detection
    services in Sub-Saharan Africa. Unplanned pregnancy is not an individual failing but reflects systemic
    gaps in reproductive healthcare access that disproportionately affect women in resource-limited settings.
