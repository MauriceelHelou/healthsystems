- 'Step 1: Long-term unemployment reduces disposable income available for alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 2: Social exclusion from workplace reduces exposure to drinking-related social activities'
- 'Step 3: Loss of employment may be associated with declining health status leading to medical abstinence'
- 'Step 4: Abstinence may also reflect ''sick quitter'' phenomenon where health deterioration precedes
  unemployment'

description: Long-term unemployment increases the likelihood of alcohol abstinence, which may reflect
  economic constraints on alcohol purchasing, health-related cessation, or social withdrawal. This finding
  highlights the importance of examining abstainers as a distinct category rather than combining with
  moderate drinkers.

  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals the heterogeneous effects of unemployment on alcohol consumption
    patterns. Abstinence in the context of unemployment may not represent improved health but rather economic
    deprivation or health deterioration - an important equity consideration that challenges simple interpretations
    of abstinence as protective.
