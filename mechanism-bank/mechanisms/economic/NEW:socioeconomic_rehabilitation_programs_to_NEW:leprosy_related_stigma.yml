  description: Programs may be more effective where economic opportunities exist and where economic status
    strongly influences social standing
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly links economic structures to health-related stigma, recognizing
    that poverty and economic exclusion compound disease-based discrimination. Addresses root causes of
    marginalization rather than just attitudes.
