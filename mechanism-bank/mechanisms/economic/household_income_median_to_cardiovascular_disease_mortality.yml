direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low income restricts access to material resources essential for health maintenance'
- 'Step 2: Economic deprivation increases exposure to unhealthy living conditions and food environments'
- 'Step 3: Financial constraints limit access to preventive healthcare and medication adherence'
- 'Step 4: Chronic financial stress activates physiological stress responses and inflammation'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative cardiovascular damage leads to increased CVD events and mortality'

description: Low income is associated with a 38% increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to
  high income. While significant, this effect is smaller than that of education (RR=1.56), suggesting
  that economic resources alone do not fully explain the socioeconomic gradient in CVD risk.

  description: Women with low SES show higher CVD risk than men, suggesting income effects may be modified
    by gender-based economic inequities
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Income inequality reflects structural economic arrangements including wage policies,
    labor market conditions, and wealth distribution. Low income is not an individual failing but a product
    of economic systems that create and maintain inequality. This mechanism appropriately identifies income
    as a structural determinant that shapes health through material pathways.
