direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Job loss creates acute economic stress and threatens core identity, leading
  to psychological distress and loss of structured daily routine'
- 'Step 2: Economic scarcity and unemployment status increase delay discounting and
  impulsive decision-making, while reducing social support and increasing isolation'
- 'Step 3: These psychosocial stressors and cognitive changes promote alcohol use
  as a coping mechanism, which can escalate to alcohol use disorder, particularly
  in vulnerable individuals'

description: Job loss increases risk of alcohol use disorder through multiple pathways
  including acute psychological stress, economic strain, loss of social structure,
  and changes in cognitive decision-making processes. The economic scarcity created
  by unemployment increases delay discounting and impulsive behaviors, while the psychological
  distress promotes alcohol use as a maladaptive coping mechanism.
structural_competency_notes: This mechanism is embedded in broader economic structures
  where job insecurity and unemployment create cascading health risks. Structural
  factors such as inadequate social safety nets, limited access to mental health services
  during unemployment, and economic inequality amplify the pathway from job loss to
  substance use disorders.
