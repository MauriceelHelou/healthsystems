direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Private liquor stores provide additional retail alcohol access beyond government stores'
- 'Step 2: Increased private store sales contribute to higher population alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Off-premise alcohol consumption leads to at-home or informal social drinking'
- 'Step 4: Social gatherings involving alcohol may violate physical distancing guidelines'
- 'Step 5: COVID-19 infections increase 4 weeks following elevated private store sales (longer lag than
  government stores)'

description: Private liquor store sales predicted COVID-19 infections 4 weeks later, with a 7.13% increase
  per standard drink/person/week. The longer lag time compared to government stores (4 weeks vs 2 weeks)
  may reflect different purchasing and consumption patterns among private store customers.

  description: Private liquor store effect peaked at 4-week lag rather than 2-week lag seen with government
    stores, possibly reflecting different consumption patterns or customer demographics
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding illustrates how the mix of public and private alcohol retail systems
    shapes population health outcomes. The different lag times between government and private store effects
    suggest that retail environment characteristics (location, customer base, purchasing patterns) influence
    how alcohol consumption translates to health outcomes. This supports structural rather than individual-level
    interventions to address alcohol-related harms.
