direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower SES communities may have higher density of alcohol retail outlets and associated advertising'
- 'Step 2: Lower SES youth may have greater exposure to mass media with alcohol advertising due to differential
  media consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol industry may disproportionately target marketing toward lower-income communities and
  demographics'
- 'Step 4: Reduced resources for higher SES families to limit children''s commercial media exposure'

description: Lower individual socioeconomic status among adolescents was associated with greater exposure
  to alcohol advertising, independent of country-level factors. This suggests that within countries, disadvantaged
  youth face disproportionate exposure to alcohol marketing.

  equity_implications: This finding highlights a critical health equity concern - the alcohol industry's
    marketing practices may disproportionately impact lower SES youth who already face greater health
    risks. Strong marketing regulations could serve as an equity intervention by reducing this differential
    exposure. The mechanism avoids blaming individuals/families and instead points to structural factors
    (industry targeting, media environment, community alcohol retail density) that create unequal exposure.
