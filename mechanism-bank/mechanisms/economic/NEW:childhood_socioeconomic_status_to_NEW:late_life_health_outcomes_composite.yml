mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advantaged childhood socioeconomic conditions provide better nutrition, healthcare access,
  and educational opportunities'
- 'Step 2: Favorable early life conditions support optimal physical and cognitive development'
- 'Step 3: Educational attainment and human capital accumulation lead to better adult socioeconomic positions'
- 'Step 4: Adult resources enable continued health-promoting behaviors and healthcare access'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative advantage across the life course produces better health outcomes in middle and older
  age'

description: A more socioeconomically advantaged childhood is generally associated with better health
  outcomes in middle and older age, demonstrating the long-reaching effects of early life structural conditions
  on health trajectories

  variation_notes: Study specifically examines China using nationally representative CHARLS data; notes
    that SES-health relationships are underexplored in non-Western contexts

  description: Results indicate both homogeneity and heterogeneity in impacts across different health
    outcomes; most outcomes follow expected positive gradient but obesity shows reversal for previously
    overweight individuals
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural inequalities in childhood become embodied
    as health inequities decades later. The six indicators of childhood SES used in the study capture
    multiple dimensions of early structural advantage/disadvantage. Policy implications point to early
    childhood intervention and poverty reduction as health equity strategies.
