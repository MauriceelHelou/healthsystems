description: Representative payee programs demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing money management skills
  among adults with behavioral health conditions. This reflects the program's dual function of managing
  immediate finances while potentially building longer-term financial capabilities.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the structural reality that individuals with serious mental
    illness or substance use disorders often have impaired money management due to cognitive effects of
    their conditions or gaps in prior financial education, not personal moral failing. Structural interventions
    can build capacity rather than simply restricting access.
