direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low income limits financial resources available for healthcare-related expenses despite universal
  coverage'
- 'Step 2: Indirect costs of accessing care (transportation, time off work, childcare) create barriers'
- 'Step 3: Low-income populations face greater competing demands for basic necessities'
- 'Step 4: Limited flexibility in work schedules reduces ability to attend appointments'
- 'Step 5: Unmet primary care needs accumulate leading to delayed or foregone care'

description: Low income is associated with increased unmet need for primary care in Canada despite universal
  healthcare coverage, suggesting that economic barriers extend beyond direct payment for services to
  include indirect costs and opportunity costs of accessing care.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Prevalence of unmet need varied between 6.6% and 25.2% across national studies in Canada,
    suggesting geographic variation in how income affects access

  description: Having a family physician was negatively associated with unmet need, potentially buffering
    the effect of low income
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates that universal healthcare coverage alone is insufficient
    to ensure equitable access. Structural economic inequities create differential access through indirect
    costs, work schedule constraints, and competing demands for basic necessities. The finding challenges
    narratives that attribute healthcare non-use to individual choice or motivation.
