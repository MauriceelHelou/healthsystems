direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher national income enables greater public investment in healthcare infrastructure and preventive
  services'
- 'Step 2: Increased resources support breast cancer screening programs, early detection initiatives,
  and health promotion campaigns'
- 'Step 3: Early diagnosis leads to identification of breast cancer at earlier, more treatable stages'
- 'Step 4: Access to advanced treatment modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, targeted therapies)
  improves survival outcomes'
- 'Step 5: Reduced breast cancer mortality among young women in high-income countries'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that breast cancer mortality among
  young women (ages 20-49) varies inversely with national income level. High-income countries show significantly
  declining mortality rates (10.2 per 100,000), while lower-middle-income countries have nearly double
  the mortality rate (20.3 per 100,000). The disparity is attributed to differential investment in healthcare
  infrastructure, screening programs, and treatment access.

    20.3 per 100,000. Data from 54 countries across income levels.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism clearly traces health disparities to structural economic factors
    at the national level rather than individual behaviors. The paper explicitly attributes mortality
    disparities to ''insufficient investment in preventive measures, health promotion, early diagnosis,
    and treatment'' - identifying policy and resource allocation as root causes. This has profound equity
    implications: young women in lower-income countries face nearly twice the mortality risk due to structural
    barriers to care, not personal choices. The mechanism highlights how global economic inequality translates
    directly into preventable deaths.'
