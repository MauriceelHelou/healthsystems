mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher minimum wage levels increase income for low-wage workers, improving
  their socioeconomic status'
- 'Step 2: Increased income reduces financial stress and improves access to material
  resources necessary for health (food security, housing stability, healthcare)'
- 'Step 3: Improved material conditions and reduced chronic stress contribute to better
  overall health status'
- 'Step 4: Better health status translates to lower likelihood of reporting fair or
  poor self-rated health'

description: Higher minimum wage levels are associated with reduced likelihood of
  fair/poor self-rated health through improvements in socioeconomic status and material
  conditions. This systematic review found clear benefits to policies that improve
  socioeconomic status and opportunities, though findings across minimum wage studies
  were mixed. The mechanism operates through increased income reducing financial stress
  and improving access to health-promoting resources.
