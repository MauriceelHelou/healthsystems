mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Effective tax pass-through increases alcohol retail prices'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices create economic barriers to high-volume alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced consumption intensity decreases physiological dependence development'
- 'Step 4: Population-level reduction in heavy drinking patterns leads to lower incidence of alcohol use
  disorder'

description: The findings on alcohol tax pass-through rates inform understanding of how taxation policies
  can be designed to effectively reduce alcohol-related health harms including alcohol use disorder. Complete
  or over-shifting of taxes ensures policy intent is translated to consumer-facing prices.

  description: Imperfectly competitive markets with overshifting produce larger price increases per unit
    of tax, potentially amplifying consumption reduction effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how fiscal policy can serve as a structural intervention
    for alcohol-related harm reduction. Rather than focusing on individual willpower or treatment-seeking
    behavior, it addresses the upstream economic environment that shapes drinking patterns. The structural
    approach recognizes that alcohol use disorder develops within economic and social contexts that can
    be modified through policy.
