  business. This economic perception may influence compliance behavior and create resistance to tobacco
  control policy implementation.

  equity_implications: Understanding vendor economic concerns is essential for designing effective tobacco
    control that addresses livelihood impacts. Policy interventions must consider structural economic
    factors affecting vendor compliance rather than simply punishing non-compliance. Economic support
    or transition programs may be needed.
