direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Income inequality shapes energy infrastructure investment priorities toward cheaper fossil
  fuel options'
- 'Step 2: Poor households rely on affordable but polluting energy sources (kerosene, coal, traditional
  biomass)'
- 'Step 3: Industrial development in unequal economies often prioritizes cost-minimizing fossil fuel energy'
- 'Step 4: Lack of progressive energy policy in unequal societies maintains nonrenewable energy dependence'

description: Income inequality influences nonrenewable energy consumption patterns in African countries.
  The study finds time-varying relationships between these variables that standard parametric models cannot
  detect, with dominant channels shifting at specific time periods.

  description: The impact of income inequality on nonrenewable energy consumption varies across different
    time periods
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism connects structural economic inequality to environmental health
    outcomes through energy system pathways. Nonrenewable energy consumption is linked to air pollution,
    respiratory disease, and climate change impacts that disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations.
    The analysis appropriately focuses on systemic economic structures rather than individual energy choices.
