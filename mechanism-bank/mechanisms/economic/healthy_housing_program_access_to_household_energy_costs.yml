  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses energy poverty as a structural issue affecting health
    through housing quality and affordability. It recognizes that health inequities stem from economic
    constraints, not individual choices. The intervention addresses market failures where landlords have
    no incentive to improve energy efficiency in rental properties.
