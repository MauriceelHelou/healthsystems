mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poverty creates chronic stress, limited economic opportunities, and inadequate
  living conditions'
- 'Step 2: Economic marginalization increases alcohol use as a coping mechanism for
  structural stressors'

  and progression'
- 'Step 4: Poverty limits access to TB screening and treatment, compounding comorbidity
  burden'
