direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advantaged childhood socioeconomic status provides greater access to calorie-dense foods and
  reduced physical labor requirements'
- 'Step 2: Children from advantaged backgrounds in China''s historical context were more likely to be
  overweight due to food abundance'
- 'Step 3: Overweight status in childhood creates metabolic and behavioral patterns that persist'
- 'Step 4: The probability of remaining overweight into older age increases for those with advantaged
  childhood SES'
- 'Step 5: Results in higher obesity prevalence among those with advantaged childhood backgrounds who
  were overweight as children'

description: For individuals who were overweight in childhood, advantaged socioeconomic status appears
  to increase the probability of remaining overweight in older age, representing a context-specific reversal
  of typical SES-health gradients
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: This relationship is specific to China's context where childhood overweight was associated
    with socioeconomic advantage, which may differ from Western contexts where obesity is often associated
    with disadvantage

  description: The positive effect of advantaged SES on later-life obesity is contingent on being overweight
    in childhood; this moderates the typically protective effect of high SES
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights how structural conditions operate differently across contexts.
    In China's developmental history, food access was a marker of privilege, creating paradoxical health
    effects. This underscores the importance of context-specific structural analysis rather than universal
    assumptions about SES-health relationships.
