  node_name: Alcohol Retail Price
to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol retail prices (resulting from tax pass-through) increase the economic cost of
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Price elasticity of demand causes reduction in quantity of alcohol purchased, particularly
  among price-sensitive populations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced purchasing translates to decreased consumption frequency and volume, including reduced
  binge drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the completeness of tax pass-through to retail
  prices'

description: This mechanism links alcohol pricing (as influenced by taxation and pass-through rates) to
  alcohol consumption behaviors. The meta-analysis findings on pass-through rates are essential for understanding
  the full causal chain from tax policy to health outcomes via pricing mechanisms.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism traces how structural economic policy (taxation) affects health
    behaviors through market-mediated price signals. It avoids individual blame by recognizing that consumption
    patterns are shaped by economic accessibility. However, there are equity concerns: regressive taxation
    effects mean lower-income populations bear proportionally higher costs, even as they may experience
    greater health benefits from reduced consumption. Optimal policy design must balance public health
    goals with economic justice considerations.'
