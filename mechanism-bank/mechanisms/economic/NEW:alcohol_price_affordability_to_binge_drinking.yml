direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol prices reduce affordability of alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Reduced affordability limits quantity of alcohol consumers can purchase'
- 'Step 3: Price sensitivity varies by income and drinking pattern'
- 'Step 4: Heavy drinkers of cheap alcohol most affected by price increases'
- 'Step 5: Overall population consumption decreases with reduced affordability'

description: The review used the wider literature on taxation and affordability to fulfill the analogy
  criterion, supporting the mechanism that reduced alcohol affordability leads to reduced consumption.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights economic determinants of alcohol consumption. While lower-income
    populations may be more affected by price increases, they also bear greater burden of alcohol-related
    harms, suggesting potential for reducing health inequities through pricing policy.
