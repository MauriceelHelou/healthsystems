direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High income inequality reduces middle-class purchasing power and limits broad-based demand
  for renewable energy'
- 'Step 2: Concentrated poverty prevents large segments of population from investing in cleaner energy
  technologies'
- 'Step 3: Political influence of fossil fuel interests may be stronger in highly unequal societies where
  wealth determines policy'
- 'Step 4: Reduced public investment in renewable energy infrastructure as fiscal policy favors elite
  interests'

description: At certain time periods, income inequality negatively affects renewable energy consumption
  through channels such as reduced middle-class demand and weakened public investment in sustainable infrastructure.
  The nonparametric model reveals this time-varying negative relationship that parametric models fail
  to detect.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The negative relationship appears at specific time periods during the 1990-2015 study
    window across 18 African countries

  description: At certain time periods, income inequality negatively affects renewable energy consumption

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces environmental health determinants to structural economic
    inequality. By showing how income distribution affects energy infrastructure decisions, it avoids
    blaming individuals and instead highlights systemic barriers to clean energy access. This has direct
    implications for environmental health equity as fossil fuel dependence disproportionately affects
    low-income communities through air pollution exposure.
