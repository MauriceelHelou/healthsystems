- 'Step 1: Low socioeconomic status creates financial barriers to accessing health services'
- 'Step 2: Disadvantaged adolescents face compounded barriers including stigma associated with seeking
  behavioral health services'
- 'Step 3: Limited resources reduce ability to travel to health services or pay for prevention programs'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative barriers result in disadvantaged adolescents experiencing disproportionate chronic
  disease burden'

description: Low socioeconomic status creates structural barriers to health services including affordability
  and stigma, which partially explain why disadvantaged adolescents experience disproportionate chronic
  disease burden and greater engagement in risk behaviors

  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly identifies structural and economic barriers as root causes
    of health inequities among adolescents. The framework avoids individual blame by recognizing that
    engagement in risk behaviors is partially explained by lack of access to prevention services due to
    structural factors beyond individual control.
