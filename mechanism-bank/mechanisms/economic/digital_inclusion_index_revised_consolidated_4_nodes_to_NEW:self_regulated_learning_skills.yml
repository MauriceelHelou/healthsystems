description: Digital inclusion is a structural prerequisite for benefiting from adaptive digital learning
  environments. The review's focus on technology-based interventions implies that populations without
  digital access cannot benefit from these educational innovations, potentially widening educational inequities
  in self-regulation skill development.

  description: Rural areas often have limited broadband infrastructure affecting access to adaptive learning

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly addresses structural inequities in technology access
    as a determinant of educational opportunity. The digital divide represents a structural barrier that
    disproportionately affects low-income communities, rural populations, and marginalized groups. Policy
    implications include need for infrastructure investment and digital equity initiatives to ensure adaptive
    learning benefits reach all populations. The review's call for supporting 'adoption and proliferation'
    of these technologies must be coupled with addressing access barriers.
