direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Job insecurity generates chronic psychosocial stress among workers'
- 'Step 2: Stress hormones and sustained muscle tension affect spinal musculature'
- 'Step 3: Workers experiencing job insecurity may underreport symptoms or delay treatment to avoid appearing
  less productive'
- 'Step 4: Physical work demands combined with stress-related physiological changes increase back injury
  risk'
- 'Step 5: Progressive development of back-related musculoskeletal disorders'

description: The systematic review identified back disorders alongside upper limb disorders as the body
  areas most affected by job insecurity, demonstrating how economic precarity manifests as specific physical
  health outcomes through stress-mediated pathways.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Back disorders represent a major cause of disability and lost work time, disproportionately
    affecting workers in physically demanding occupations that often feature less job security. The finding
    that job insecurity itself contributes to back MSDs independent of physical demands highlights the
    need for structural interventions addressing employment stability as a health determinant.
