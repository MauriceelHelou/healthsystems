- 'Step 1: Census-tract poverty creates concentrated neighborhood disadvantage'
- 'Step 2: Economic stress and limited resources in high-poverty areas may increase psychological distress'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol may be used as an accessible coping mechanism in resource-poor environments'
- 'Step 4: However, the effect was not mediated by collective efficacy in this sample'

description: The study examined whether census-level poverty affected binge drinking through collective
  efficacy. No indirect effects were found for the relationship between neighborhood poverty and binge
  drinking mediated by collective efficacy for either men or women.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study conducted in San Juan, Puerto Rico with 83% response rate from household random
    sample
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The study appropriately conceptualized poverty as an area-level structural factor
    affecting individual health behaviors. While this specific mediational pathway was not supported,
    the research design demonstrates structural competency by focusing on census-tract characteristics
    rather than individual-level explanations for drinking behavior.
