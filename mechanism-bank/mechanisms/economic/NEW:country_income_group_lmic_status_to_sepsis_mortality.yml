direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower national income level correlates with reduced healthcare system infrastructure and resource
  availability'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to advanced critical care equipment (mechanical ventilation, ICU beds) constrains
  treatment options'
- 'Step 3: Higher fluid volume resuscitation in resource-limited settings leads to fluid overload without
  adequate support mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Fluid overload causes pulmonary edema and organ congestion that cannot be managed with unavailable
  ventilatory support'
- 'Step 5: Increased mortality results from inability to manage complications of aggressive fluid resuscitation'

description: In sepsis resuscitation, higher fluid volume strategies are associated with increased mortality
  specifically in low-and middle-income countries (OR 1.47), while showing no effect in high-income countries
  (OR 1.00). This differential effect is mediated by resource constraints, particularly limited access
  to mechanical ventilation needed to manage fluid overload complications.

  variation_notes: Effect of higher fluid volume on mortality significantly differs between LMICs (OR
    1.47, harmful) and HICs (OR 1.00, neutral), with p=0.01 for subgroup differences. Baseline mortality
    also higher in LMICs (37%) vs HICs (29%).

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how global economic inequities produce differential
    health outcomes even when the same clinical intervention is applied. The harm is not due to patient
    characteristics or provider decisions, but to structural resource constraints that make guideline-concordant
    care developed in HICs potentially harmful in LMICs. This highlights the need for context-specific
    clinical guidelines that account for healthcare system capacity rather than universal protocols.
