direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower socioeconomic status limits financial resources for medication copays and transportation
  to follow-up appointments'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints lead to food insecurity affecting dietary adherence (low-sodium diet)'
- 'Step 3: Housing instability and poor housing conditions may exacerbate cardiovascular stress'
- 'Step 4: Reduced ability to take time off work for medical appointments and self-care'
- 'Step 5: Increased risk of decompensation and hospital readmission within 30 days'

description: Socioeconomic status was among the most commonly examined SDoH affecting heart failure readmissions
  and hospitalizations across the 59 included studies, with lower SES generally associated with worse
  outcomes though effects varied by measurement approach
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies used varying definitions and measures of SES, contributing to inconsistent
    findings across geographic contexts

- name: age

  description: Older age combined with low SES may compound readmission risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism centers economic structures rather than individual financial decisions.
    The review notes that SES encompasses multiple structural factors including income, employment, and
    wealth that shape healthcare access and disease management capacity. Inconsistent findings highlight
    the need for validated, comprehensive SES measures that capture structural economic barriers.
