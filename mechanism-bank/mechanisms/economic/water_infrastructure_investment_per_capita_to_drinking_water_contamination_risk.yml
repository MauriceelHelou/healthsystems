direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate investment in water treatment infrastructure limits capacity to remove heavy metals
  from source water'
- 'Step 2: Aging or absent treatment systems fail to achieve regulatory standards for contaminant removal'
- 'Step 3: Rural and underserved communities receive less infrastructure investment'
- 'Step 4: Populations served by underfunded water systems experience chronic exposure to elevated heavy
  metal concentrations'

description: The review explicitly notes that heavy metal contamination in drinking water is 'a big concern
  for humankind, particularly in developing countries,' implicating infrastructure investment as a structural
  driver of contamination risk.

  description: Rural villages may receive less water infrastructure investment than urban centers, creating
    differential exposure risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Water infrastructure investment is a fundamental structural determinant shaped
    by economic development, political priorities, and resource allocation decisions. Communities lacking
    economic or political power to secure infrastructure investment face systematic exposure to contaminated
    water. This creates environmental injustice along economic and geographic lines.
