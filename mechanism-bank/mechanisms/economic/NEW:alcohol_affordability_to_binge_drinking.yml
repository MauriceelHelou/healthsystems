description: The study found that alcohol affordability remained a key driver of underage alcohol access
  despite the sachet ban. Products remained accessible to different income population groups, including
  adolescents, suggesting that pricing interventions may be necessary complements to product bans.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism identifies economic accessibility as a structural determinant,
    recognizing that individual purchasing decisions occur within contexts of product pricing and availability.
    The equity implications are significant: affordable alcohol products disproportionately target and
    harm low-income communities. Policy recommendations should focus on pricing regulations rather than
    individual-level interventions.'
