- 'Step 1: Unemployment creates economic stress and financial insecurity within households,
  increasing tension between intimate partners'
- 'Step 2: Economic dependency resulting from unemployment limits women''s ability
  to leave abusive relationships or negotiate within partnerships'
- 'Step 3: Unemployed partners may experience frustration, loss of traditional provider
  role identity, and reduced self-esteem, which can manifest as controlling or violent
  behavior'
- 'Step 4: Limited employment opportunities reduce access to resources and social
  support networks that could serve as protective factors against IPV'

description: Employment status, specifically unemployment, was identified as a significant
  risk factor for intimate partner violence in a systematic review and meta-analysis
  of 20 studies focusing on HIV-positive women in sub-Saharan Africa. Unemployment
  increases economic vulnerability and dependency, reduces protective resources, and
  creates household stress that elevates IPV risk.
