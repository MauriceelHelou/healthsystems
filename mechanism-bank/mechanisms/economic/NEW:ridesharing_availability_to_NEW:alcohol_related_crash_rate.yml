direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ridesharing services are introduced but require credit card payment and smartphone access'
- 'Step 2: Low socioeconomic municipalities have lower rates of credit card ownership and technology adoption'
- 'Step 3: Residents in these areas cannot access ridesharing as alternative to driving after drinking'
- 'Step 4: Existing transportation barriers persist or worsen, potentially leading to maintained or increased
  alcohol-related crashes'

description: In low socioeconomic municipalities, the introduction of Uber was not associated with crash
  reductions and showed a non-significant trend toward increased alcohol-related crashes (RR=1.10, 95%
  CI 0.97-1.23). This suggests that when ridesharing services are structurally inaccessible due to payment
  and technology barriers, the intervention provides no harm reduction benefit and may coincide with other
  factors affecting crash rates.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding highlights how market-based solutions to public health problems can
    widen existing inequities. The inability of low-income populations to access ridesharing services
    reflects broader patterns of financial exclusion (unbanked/underbanked status, lack of credit access)
    and digital divide. The structural barrier is not individual failure to use available services, but
    systemic exclusion from service access. Policy responses should address these root causes through
    cash payment options, subsidized access, or enhanced public transit in underserved areas.
