mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Commercial markets make attractive but harmful commodities widely available'
- 'Step 2: Consumer exposure to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, processed foods, and gambling increases'
- 'Step 3: Population-level consumption of harmful commodities rises with availability'
- 'Step 4: Increased consumption leads to addiction, chronic disease, and mortality'

description: 'The paper identifies a common mechanism across unhealthy commodities: commercial availability
  drives population-level harm, and control measures that restrict availability reduce these harms'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Paper explicitly notes that histories of markets and controls vary across commodities
    and jurisdictions, with different regulatory regimes for different products in different places

  description: Tobacco and alcohol have historically faced more controls than sugar and processed foods
    until recent years

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Commodities with longer regulatory histories (tobacco) show greater harm reduction
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies the commercial determinants of health framework. The
    paper explicitly calls for 'looking across what have been separate fields of action and experience'
    to learn from effective controls. This structural approach recognizes that harm arises from commercial
    systems rather than individual consumer weakness, and that policy responses must target these systems.
    The historical variation in regulation (few limits on sugar until recently) demonstrates how commercial
    interests shape regulatory environments.
