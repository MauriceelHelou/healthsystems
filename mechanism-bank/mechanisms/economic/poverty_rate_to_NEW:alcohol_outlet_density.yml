direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Areas with higher income deprivation have lower commercial rents and property values'
- 'Step 2: Lower barriers to entry attract retail establishments selling alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Less political power in deprived communities to oppose alcohol outlet licensing'
- 'Step 4: Licensing policies may not adequately consider cumulative impact in deprived areas'
- 'Step 5: Result is higher concentration of alcohol outlets in deprived neighbourhoods'

description: Neighbourhood-level income deprivation is positively associated with both off-sales and on-sales
  alcohol outlet density, with the most deprived quintile having highest densities and the least deprived
  having lowest densities.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Linear relationship observed across deprivation quintiles in Scotland; effect consistent
    for both off-sales and on-sales alcohol outlets
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how economic deprivation shapes the built environment in
    ways that perpetuate health inequities. The concentration of alcohol retail in poor areas is not random
    but reflects structural economic and political processes. Policy interventions should address licensing
    policies and their differential impact on deprived communities.
