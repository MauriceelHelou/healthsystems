mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic recessions lead to increased unemployment rates at local and national levels'
- 'Step 2: Unemployment creates financial stress, loss of purpose, and reduced social integration among
  young populations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced income and economic uncertainty increase psychological distress and coping-related
  substance use'
- 'Step 4: Young populations with fewer economic opportunities and social supports turn to illicit drugs
  as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 5: Aggregate drug use increases during recessionary periods, particularly cannabis use'

description: Meta-analysis of 25 studies demonstrates that economic recessions, measured primarily through
  unemployment rates, are associated with increased illicit drug use among young populations. The partial
  correlation of 0.03 indicates a small but statistically significant positive relationship, supporting
  countercyclical drug use patterns. Nine studies found countercyclical relationships, three found procyclical,
  and thirteen found mixed results, with the aggregate evidence supporting increased drug use during economic
  hardship.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately locates the driver of drug use in macroeconomic conditions
    and policy failures rather than individual moral failings. The framework recognizes that unemployment
    and economic recession create structural vulnerabilities that increase substance use risk, particularly
    among young people who may have fewer resources and social supports. The policy implication emphasizes
    the need for public prevention programs and demand reduction interventions during economic downturns,
    targeting structural causes rather than individual behavior. Equity implications include recognizing
    that young populations face differential vulnerability during recessions due to their position in
    labor markets and limited accumulated resources.
