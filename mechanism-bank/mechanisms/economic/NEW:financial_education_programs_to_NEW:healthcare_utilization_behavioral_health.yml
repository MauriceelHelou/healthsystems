description: Financial education and assistance interventions showed weaker but suggestive evidence for
  improving healthcare utilization among individuals with mental or substance use disorders. This reflects
  the indirect pathway through which financial literacy may improve healthcare engagement.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism recognizes that healthcare access is structurally constrained by
    economic factors. Financial education addresses information asymmetries and capacity building but
    does not address deeper structural barriers like inadequate insurance coverage or unaffordable care.
    The weaker evidence may reflect limits of education-only approaches without addressing material economic
    conditions.
