direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower educational attainment is associated with reduced health literacy'
- 'Step 2: Limited understanding of heart failure symptoms, medication importance, and self-management
  strategies'
- 'Step 3: Decreased ability to navigate complex healthcare systems and communicate with providers'
- 'Step 4: Lower likelihood of receiving and adhering to guideline-directed medical therapy'
- 'Step 5: Increased mortality from heart failure and cardiovascular disease'

description: Education and health literacy were commonly examined SDoH in studies of heart failure mortality
  and survival, with lower educational attainment generally associated with worse outcomes

  description: Health literacy mediates much of the education-mortality relationship
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Educational attainment reflects structural inequities in school funding, neighborhood
    segregation, and intergenerational poverty rather than individual capability. The mechanism appropriately
    identifies health literacy as a pathway shaped by educational access, which is structurally determined.
    Interventions should focus on health system accommodation of varying literacy levels rather than expecting
    individuals to change.
