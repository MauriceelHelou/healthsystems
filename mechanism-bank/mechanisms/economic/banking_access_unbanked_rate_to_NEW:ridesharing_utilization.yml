direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ridesharing services require credit card or digital payment methods for transactions'
- 'Step 2: Populations with limited banking access lack credit cards needed for ridesharing'
- 'Step 3: Lack of payment access prevents utilization of ridesharing services regardless of availability'
- 'Step 4: Unable to use ridesharing, individuals must rely on personal vehicles even when impaired'

description: The authors interpret the differential ridesharing effect on alcohol-related crashes by socioeconomic
  status as reflecting disparities in credit card access. Uber's requirement for credit card payment creates
  a structural barrier that excludes populations without banking access from utilizing harm reduction
  benefits of ridesharing.

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies financial exclusion as a critical mediator of health
    intervention effectiveness. Lack of banking access is not an individual choice but reflects structural
    barriers in the financial system that disproportionately affect low-income and marginalized populations.
    Addressing alcohol-related crash disparities requires attention to these upstream economic determinants.
