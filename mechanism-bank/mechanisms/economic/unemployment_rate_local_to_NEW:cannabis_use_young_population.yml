mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic recessions cause job losses and increased unemployment particularly affecting young
  workers'
- 'Step 2: Youth unemployment leads to loss of structured daily activities, income, and social networks
  tied to employment'
- 'Step 3: Financial strain and uncertain futures create stress and psychological distress among unemployed
  youth'
- 'Step 4: Cannabis, as a relatively accessible and lower-cost substance, becomes preferred coping mechanism'
- 'Step 5: Cannabis use increases disproportionately compared to other illicit substances during recession
  periods'

description: The meta-analysis specifically identifies cannabis as showing the strongest countercyclical
  relationship with economic recessions among young populations. While the overall partial correlation
  between unemployment and drug use is 0.03, the effect is notably more pronounced for cannabis compared
  to other illicit substances. This suggests cannabis serves as a primary substance of choice for young
  people coping with economic hardship, likely due to its relative availability, lower cost, and social
  acceptability compared to harder drugs.

  description: The countercyclical impact is more marked with cannabis use than with cocaine, opioids,

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how economic structures and labor market conditions shape
    substance use patterns rather than framing cannabis use as purely individual choice. The differential
    effect by drug type suggests that economic constraints (cost, availability) interact with recession
    impacts, meaning that addressing economic root causes through employment programs and social safety
    nets could be more effective than punitive drug policies. Young people's disproportionate vulnerability
    reflects their structural position in labor markets and limited wealth accumulation.
