direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unfavorable childhood socioeconomic conditions limit access to adequate nutrition, healthcare,
  and safe living environments during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Early life deprivation creates biological embedding through stress pathways and developmental
  constraints'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative disadvantage across the life course compounds early disadvantage through reduced
  educational and economic opportunities'
- 'Step 4: Limited resources in adulthood perpetuate poor health behaviors and restricted healthcare access'
- 'Step 5: Results in poorer self-rated health outcomes in middle and older age'

description: Unfavorable socioeconomic status in childhood is correlated with poorer self-rated health
  outcomes later in life, operating through life-course accumulation of disadvantage
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study focuses on China specifically, noting that the SES-health relationship is 'relatively
    underexplored' in China compared to Western countries, suggesting geographic variation in these mechanisms

  description: Current SES mediates the relationship between childhood SES and health outcomes; interaction
    effects found for disability-related outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces health inequities to structural economic conditions in childhood
    rather than individual choices. The life-course perspective emphasizes how early structural disadvantage
    becomes embedded and compounds over time, highlighting the need for early intervention policies.
