mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persistent precarious employment (12+ months) creates chronic job insecurity and unpredictable
  income'
- 'Step 2: Chronic economic uncertainty activates sustained stress response and allostatic load'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to employer-provided health benefits reduces preventive care utilization'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative physiological and psychological stress manifests in poorer self-assessed health
  status'

description: Persistent precarious employment lasting 12 or more months is associated with 53% increased
  odds of poor self-rated health compared to stable employment. This relationship reflects the cumulative
  health burden of sustained job insecurity, income volatility, and reduced access to employment-based
  benefits.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly traces health outcomes to labor market structures and
    employment arrangements rather than individual choices. The shift toward less secure employment forms
    represents a structural transformation in labor markets that disproportionately affects workers with
    less bargaining power. The authors recommend exploration of 'precautionary labour regulations and
    employment policies' as structural interventions, appropriately locating solutions at the policy level.
