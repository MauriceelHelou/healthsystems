description: The paper frames the successful tobacco advertising ban as an example of regulating commercial
  determinants of health. Proponents invoked the public health burden of smoking as justification for
  the policy, representing a population health approach to addressing tobacco-related harm.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural competency by targeting commercial practices
    (advertising) as drivers of population health outcomes rather than focusing on individual choice.
    The paper explicitly positions this as relevant to 'other campaigns seeking to regulate commercial
    determinants of health,' acknowledging the broader structural forces that shape health behaviors and
    outcomes. The analysis of opposition arguments (economy, personal freedom) reveals how commercial
    interests frame health policy debates in ways that obscure structural causation.
