direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: TAPS bans eliminate or reduce exposure to tobacco marketing across multiple channels (advertising,
  promotions, sponsorships)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced marketing exposure decreases normalization of tobacco use in the social environment'
- 'Step 3: Lower exposure to pro-tobacco messaging reduces positive attitudes and perceived social acceptability
  of smoking'
- 'Step 4: Decreased marketing pressure reduces initiation among non-smokers and supports cessation among
  current smokers'
- 'Step 5: Population-level smoking prevalence decreases as fewer people start smoking and some quit'

description: TAPS bans are associated with a 20% lower odds of current smoking (OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.95).
  This policy-level intervention operates by reducing population exposure to tobacco marketing, thereby
  decreasing normalization and social acceptability of smoking.

  description: Subgroup analyses revealed effects of TAPS bans on smoking prevalence differed significantly
    by duration of evaluation (p<0.01), suggesting longer implementation periods may show different effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention - rather than targeting individual
    behavior change, TAPS bans modify the commercial environment that promotes tobacco use. The policy
    addresses upstream determinants (marketing exposure) rather than downstream individual choices. High
    heterogeneity (I²=98.7%) suggests varying policy implementation across contexts, highlighting the
    importance of comprehensive enforcement. Many countries have yet to implement such strategies, representing
    a structural inequity in tobacco control policy adoption.
