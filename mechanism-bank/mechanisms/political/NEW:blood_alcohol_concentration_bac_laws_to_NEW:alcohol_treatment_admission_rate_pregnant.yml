mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stricter BAC laws implemented for drink-driving enforcement'
- 'Step 2: Increased detection and legal consequences for alcohol-impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: More individuals identified through legal system as having alcohol problems'
- 'Step 4: Increased mandated or incentivized referrals to substance use disorder treatment'
- 'Step 5: Higher treatment admission rates among pregnant individuals identified through enforcement'

description: BAC laws were associated with higher alcohol treatment admission rates among pregnant people.
  This may reflect increased identification of individuals with alcohol use problems through legal enforcement
  mechanisms, leading to treatment referrals rather than indicating increased alcohol consumption.

  equity_implications: The positive association between BAC laws and treatment admissions highlights the
    complex relationship between enforcement-focused policies and treatment access. While this may increase
    treatment utilization, it also raises equity concerns about criminalization pathways to care, which
    may disproportionately affect marginalized populations. The finding suggests that enforcement-based
    approaches may serve as identification mechanisms rather than prevention strategies.
