description: Poor intra-agency collaboration among department of corrections agents creates institutional
  barriers that disrupt the MOUD continuum of care for justice-involved individuals.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 25
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a systems-level organizational dysfunction rather than
    individual-level factors. Addressing this barrier requires institutional reform including improved
    information sharing protocols, integrated case management systems, and coordinated care pathways across
    correctional supervision phases.
