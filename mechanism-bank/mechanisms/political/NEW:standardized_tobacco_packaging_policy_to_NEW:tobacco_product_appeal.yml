direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Removal of brand logos, colors, and distinctive design elements eliminates marketing differentiation'
- 'Step 2: Uniform drab/dark packaging reduces aesthetic appeal and perceived product quality'
- 'Step 3: Tobacco in standardized packs perceived as worse-tasting and lower quality'
- 'Step 4: Reduced appeal diminishes both initiation risk among non-smokers and product attachment among
  current smokers'

description: The most consistent evidence across 45 studies found that standardized packs rated lower
  in appeal than branded packs. Tobacco in standardized packs was perceived as worse-tasting and lower
  quality, suggesting the policy effectively undermines marketing-based product differentiation.

  description: Findings with youth generally pointed towards standardized packs being less likely to motivate
    smoking initiation than branded packs
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses commercial determinants of health by neutralizing tobacco
    industry marketing strategies. Youth are particularly protected as the reduced appeal may prevent
    initiation, addressing intergenerational health equity concerns.
