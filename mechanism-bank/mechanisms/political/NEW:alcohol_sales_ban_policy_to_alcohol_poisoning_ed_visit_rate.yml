direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government implements prohibition on sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages during COVID-19
  lockdown'
- 'Step 2: Physical availability of alcohol dramatically reduced through closure of retail outlets and
  prohibition of sales'
- 'Step 3: Population-level alcohol consumption decreases due to restricted access'
- 'Step 4: Acute alcohol-related harms including poisoning decrease'
- 'Step 5: Emergency and trauma unit admissions for alcohol-related conditions drastically reduced'

  emergency and trauma unit admissions related to alcohol, demonstrating the causal relationship between
  alcohol availability restrictions and acute alcohol-related health outcomes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural policy interventions (alcohol prohibition)
    can produce population-level health benefits by restricting the commercial determinants of health.
    The policy addresses root causes of alcohol harm at the systems level rather than targeting individual
    drinking behaviors.
