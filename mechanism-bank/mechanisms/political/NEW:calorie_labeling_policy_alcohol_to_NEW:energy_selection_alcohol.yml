mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Calorie labeling policies extended to alcoholic beverages require display of energy content'
- 'Step 2: Consumers encounter calorie information when purchasing alcoholic drinks'
- 'Step 3: Information may influence drink selection and quantity decisions'
- 'Step 4: Potential reduction in selection of higher-calorie alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 5: Overall energy intake from alcohol may decrease'

description: Only two studies examined calorie labeling of alcoholic drinks. Results were inconclusive
  with inconsistent effects and wide confidence intervals encompassing both harm and benefit. The evidence
  is of very low certainty, and no reliable effect estimate can be provided.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This represents a critical evidence gap for alcohol policy. While calorie labeling
    for food shows promise, the extension to alcoholic beverages lacks sufficient evidence. Alcohol consumption
    contributes to non-communicable disease risk at any level, making this a priority area for structural
    intervention research. The absence of strong evidence should not preclude policy action given theoretical
    plausibility and success with food labeling.
