direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policies restricting physical availability (Liquor Supply Plans, localized
  restrictions, General Restricted Areas) limit where and when alcohol can be purchased'
- 'Step 2: Reduced physical availability decreases opportunities for impulse purchasing
  and limits access to alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 3: Decreased accessibility leads to reduced alcohol consumption in affected
  areas'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption results in reduced alcohol-related harms including health
  impacts and social harms'
