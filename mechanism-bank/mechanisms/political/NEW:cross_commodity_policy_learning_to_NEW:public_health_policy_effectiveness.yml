description: The paper argues that new public health thinking enables cross-commodity learning, where
  successful controls in one domain (e.g., tobacco licensing) can inform policy in another (e.g., gambling,
  sugar)

  equity_implications: This meta-mechanism addresses how structural interventions can be developed and
    disseminated. The paper's framing of 'unhealthy commodities' as a unified category represents a structural
    analysis that identifies common commercial determinants across seemingly disparate health issues.
    This approach supports equity by recognizing that communities with high exposure to multiple unhealthy
    commodities face cumulative structural disadvantage.
