description: The dramatic policy landscape changes around substance use from 2015-2019 appear to have
  reduced the proportion of legal system referrals to specialty SUD treatment (p<0.001). This likely reflects
  decriminalization efforts and reduced prosecution of drug offenses.

  description: Cannabis policy changes (legalization/decriminalization) particularly affect legal referrals
    for cannabis use, which declined during study period

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how policy reform shapes pathways to treatment. While
    reduced criminalization is generally positive for health equity, it raises questions about ensuring
    adequate voluntary treatment access when coercive pathways diminish. The study notes need for future
    research on policy change effects, highlighting the importance of maintaining treatment access while
    reducing punitive approaches.
