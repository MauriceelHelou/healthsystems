  adult smokers increased from 20.2% to 26.6%. This was supported by a 78% increase in quitline calls,
  suggesting the policy created a supportive environment for cessation attempts.

  variation_notes: Evidence from Australian cohort; quit attempts increased from 20.2% pre-implementation
    to 26.6% post-implementation (absolute increase of 6.4 percentage points)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This policy intervention creates structural support for cessation by altering the
    commercial environment rather than solely targeting individual willpower. It recognizes that the tobacco
    industry's marketing strategies create barriers to quitting that require policy-level intervention.
