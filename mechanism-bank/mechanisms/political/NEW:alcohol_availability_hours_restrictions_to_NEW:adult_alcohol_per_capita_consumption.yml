mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy reduces opening hours of alcohol retail outlets by at least 20%'
- 'Step 2: Physical and temporal access to alcohol purchasing becomes more restricted'
- 'Step 3: Reduced opportunities for impulse purchases and late-night alcohol acquisition'
- 'Step 4: Population-level alcohol consumption decreases due to reduced availability'

description: Availability reductions through decreased opening hours of at least 20% were associated with
  an average reduction of 0.83 litres of pure alcohol per capita per year with immediate effect. Combined
  with taxation, this represents the WHO 'best buy' approach showing environmental modification of alcohol
  access reduces consumption.

  description: The study specifically examined reductions in opening hours of at least 20%, suggesting
    a threshold effect for meaningful impact

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how modifying the built and commercial environment (hours
    of operation) directly affects population health outcomes. Rather than expecting individuals to resist
    alcohol in an environment of unlimited access, this structural approach reduces availability at the
    community level, addressing health equity by affecting all residents regardless of individual willpower
    or socioeconomic status.
