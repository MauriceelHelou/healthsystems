description: This qualitative study explored adolescent perspectives on Malawi's 2012 ban on alcohol sachets.
  While adolescents perceived the ban as a significant step toward reducing underage alcohol use, they
  reported it was rendered ineffective due to aggressive marketing, alternative packaging, and lack of
  enforcement. The study found 'business as usual' regarding alcohol availability to minors.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately focuses on policy-level interventions rather than
    blaming individual adolescents. The study reveals how structural factors (weak enforcement, industry
    marketing practices, regulatory gaps) undermine well-intentioned policies. Equity implications include
    continued disproportionate access and harm among low-income populations who were targeted by affordable
    sachet packaging. The finding that personality and drinking motives 'precede interventions' should
    be understood in context of structural availability rather than individual moral failing.
