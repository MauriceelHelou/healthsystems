mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carbon pricing policies impose costs on fossil fuel combustion and carbon-intensive industrial
  processes'
- 'Step 2: Economic incentives drive reduction in coal and fossil fuel burning for electricity and industry'
- 'Step 3: Reduced fossil fuel combustion decreases co-pollutant emissions including particulate matter
  (PM2.5)'
- 'Step 4: Lower PM2.5 concentrations in ambient air reduce population exposure to harmful air pollution'

description: Carbon pricing policies that reduce emissions from fossil fuel combustion also reduce co-pollutant
  emissions including particulate matter. This represents a structural co-benefit pathway linking climate
  policy to improved air quality and respiratory health outcomes.

  description: Regions with higher baseline fossil fuel use likely experience greater co-benefits in air
    quality improvement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Air pollution disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities
    of color who are more likely to live near industrial facilities and major roadways. Carbon pricing
    as a structural intervention can reduce these exposures system-wide. However, policy design must consider
    potential regressive impacts if costs are passed to consumers without offsetting measures.
