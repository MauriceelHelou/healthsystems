  node_name: Consumer Knowledge of Alcohol Caloric Content
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory energy labeling policy requires calorie information on alcoholic drink packaging
  and menus'
- 'Step 2: Consumers are exposed to caloric content information at point of purchase'
- 'Step 3: Information exposure increases awareness of energy content in alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 4: Knowledge gap is addressed (74% currently inaccurate about calorie content)'

description: 'Meta-analysis found that 74% (95% CI: 64%-82%) of participants were inaccurate about the
  energy content of alcoholic drinks, demonstrating substantial knowledge gaps that labeling policy could
  address.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a structural information asymmetry - consumers lack basic
    nutritional information about alcohol that they have for food products. The absence of labeling requirements
    is a policy gap that disadvantages consumers attempting to make informed choices. This is a systems-level
    issue, not individual failure.
