direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Governments or researchers propose alcohol warning labels with cancer-specific messaging on
  containers'
- 'Step 2: Warning labels provide point-of-purchase health information at moment of consumer decision'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to cancer risk information increases population awareness of causal relationship'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness may shift social norms and support for additional alcohol control policies'

description: Alcohol warning labels with cancer messages represent a structural policy intervention to
  increase public awareness of alcohol-cancer risk, but their effectiveness is moderated by industry opposition
  and media framing of the policy debate.

spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: 'Media coverage supportiveness varied substantially: Canada (Yukon study) showed 68.4%
    supportive coverage while Ireland showed only 18.9% supportive coverage, suggesting different political
    and cultural contexts affect policy reception.'

  description: Framing as academic research (Canada) vs. legislation (Ireland) affected media reception,
    with research framing generating more supportive coverage
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Warning labels represent a structural intervention that shifts responsibility from
    individual knowledge-seeking to corporate disclosure requirements. This policy approach recognizes
    that individuals cannot make informed choices without adequate information, which the market does
    not naturally provide due to industry incentives to obscure health risks. The mechanism addresses
    information asymmetry as a structural barrier to health.
