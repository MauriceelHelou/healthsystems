mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government implements increased excise duties on alcoholic beverages (20%, 50%, or 100% increase
  modeled)'
- 'Step 2: Tax increase translates fully into higher consumer prices'
- 'Step 3: Price increase reduces population alcohol consumption via demand elasticity'
- 'Step 4: Reduced consumption decreases population exposure to alcohol''s carcinogenic effects'
- 'Step 5: Fewer alcohol-attributable cancer cases develop at the population level'

description: This modelling study demonstrates that increasing alcohol excise taxation by 100% could prevent
  3-7% of all alcohol-attributable cancer cases across 4 European countries. If these countries adopted
  Finnish-level excise taxes, Germany alone would see 1,600 fewer cancer cases annually. This represents
  a significant population-level prevention strategy.

  variation_notes: A 100% increase in excise taxation would avert 3-7% of alcohol-attributable cancers
    depending on the country. Adopting Finnish-level taxation would yield even greater reductions, with
    Germany alone experiencing 1,600 fewer cancer cases in one year.

    cancer reduction compared to countries with already high taxes (Sweden)

  description: The model used beverage-specific taxation, acknowledging that different beverages may have
    different price elasticities and cancer risk profiles
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism exemplifies structural competency by identifying fiscal policy
    as a powerful lever for population health improvement. Rather than targeting individual drinking behaviors,
    it addresses the commercial determinants of health through pricing policy. The analysis highlights
    equity implications: countries with weaker alcohol policies (lower taxes) bear a higher burden of
    alcohol-attributable cancers. The finding that heavy drinkers are less price-elastic raises equity
    concerns about whether taxation alone adequately protects the most vulnerable populations who may
    need additional treatment and support services.'
