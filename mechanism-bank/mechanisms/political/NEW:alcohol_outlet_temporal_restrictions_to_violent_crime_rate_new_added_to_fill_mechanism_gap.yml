direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensing policies restrict operating hours of alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 2: Reduced late-night alcohol availability limits opportunities for intoxication during high-risk
  hours'
- 'Step 3: Earlier closing times reduce congregation of intoxicated individuals in nighttime entertainment
  areas'
- 'Step 4: Decreased late-night intoxication reduces alcohol-related violence and assault incidents'

description: Licensing policies that restrict temporal availability of alcohol (operating hours) contribute
  to reductions in violent crime by limiting opportunities for late-night intoxication and associated
  violence.

  description: Effects observed 2009-2013 but not thereafter, suggesting policy effectiveness may diminish
    over time or be affected by other changes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Temporal restrictions represent a structural intervention that modifies the environment
    rather than targeting individual drinkers. This approach recognizes that violence patterns are shaped
    by the commercial availability of alcohol and the concentration of intoxicated individuals in time
    and space.
