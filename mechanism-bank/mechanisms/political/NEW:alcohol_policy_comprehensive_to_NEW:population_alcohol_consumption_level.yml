description: The study concludes that because high SBIRT screening coverage rates may only be achievable
  in the long run, other effective alcohol policies are required to achieve short-term reduction of alcohol
  use and attributable harm in Germany. This acknowledges that clinical interventions alone are insufficient
  and must be complemented by structural policy approaches.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly recognizes the primacy of structural/policy interventions
    over individual-level clinical approaches for population health improvement. The acknowledgment that
    SBIRT alone is insufficient highlights the need for comprehensive policy environments that address
    the commercial determinants of health (alcohol industry practices, pricing, availability). This reflects
    a structural competency approach that looks beyond healthcare to economic and regulatory factors.
