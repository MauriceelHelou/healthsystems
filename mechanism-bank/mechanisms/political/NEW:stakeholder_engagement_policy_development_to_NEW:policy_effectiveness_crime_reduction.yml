  equity_implications: This meta-mechanism about participatory policy development reflects structural
    competency by centering community knowledge and recognizing that residents of affected neighborhoods
    have essential expertise about local dynamics. The approach counters top-down policy making that may
    miss crucial contextual factors. Equity implications include ensuring that communities most affected
    by both alcohol outlet concentration and crime have voice in policy solutions.
