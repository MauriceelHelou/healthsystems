direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State policies prohibit or restrict spirits sales in grocery stores'
- 'Step 2: Reduced physical availability and convenience of purchasing high-alcohol-content beverages'
- 'Step 3: Lower population-level alcohol consumption, including among pregnant individuals'
- 'Step 4: Reduced need for formal substance use disorder treatment during pregnancy'

description: States with policies prohibiting spirits sales in grocery stores had 12% lower alcohol treatment
  admission rates among pregnant individuals compared to states allowing both heavy beer and spirits sales
  in grocery stores. This suggests general population alcohol availability policies are relevant for pregnant
  people's treatment utilization.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes structural policy interventions that affect alcohol availability
    at the population level, rather than targeting individual pregnant people. It demonstrates that general
    population policies can benefit vulnerable subpopulations without pregnancy-specific targeting, which
    has been shown to have limited effectiveness and established risks. The focus on retail environment
    policy avoids stigmatizing pregnant individuals while addressing upstream determinants of alcohol
    use disorder.
