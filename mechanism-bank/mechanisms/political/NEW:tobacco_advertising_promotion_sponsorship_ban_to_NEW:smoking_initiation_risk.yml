direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: TAPS bans remove tobacco industry marketing designed to recruit new smokers, particularly youth'
- 'Step 2: Youth and young adults experience reduced exposure to glamorized tobacco imagery and sponsorship
  associations'
- 'Step 3: Absence of marketing reduces curiosity, positive expectations, and perceived benefits of smoking'
- 'Step 4: Social norms shift away from tobacco use as marketing presence diminishes in community spaces'
- 'Step 5: Risk of initiating smoking decreases at the population level, particularly among vulnerable
  age groups'

description: TAPS bans are associated with a 37% reduced risk of smoking initiation (HR=0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.82).
  This protective effect operates by reducing youth and young adult exposure to tobacco marketing that
  promotes initiation.

  variation_notes: High heterogeneity (I²=95%) indicates substantial variation across studies, likely
    reflecting differences in policy comprehensiveness, enforcement, and population characteristics across
    different countries and regions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural policy interventions can prevent health-harming
    behaviors before they begin. By targeting the commercial determinants of health (tobacco marketing),
    TAPS bans protect populations - especially youth - from industry recruitment tactics. The substantial
    effect size (37% reduction) highlights the power of environmental modification over individual-level
    interventions. Countries without TAPS bans expose their populations, particularly youth, to preventable
    health risks, representing a policy-driven health inequity.
