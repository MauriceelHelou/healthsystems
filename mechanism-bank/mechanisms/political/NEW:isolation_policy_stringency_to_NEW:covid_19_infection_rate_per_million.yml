mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government implements early and aggressive isolation/quarantine policies restricting population
  movement'
- 'Step 2: Reduced person-to-person contact decreases opportunities for viral transmission'
- 'Step 3: Lower effective reproduction number (below R0 of 3.05) limits exponential spread'
- 'Step 4: Standardized infection rate per million population decreases'
- 'Step 5: Healthcare system capacity remains within manageable range'

description: Meta-analysis establishing R0 of 3.05 for COVID-19 demonstrates that early and aggressive
  isolation policies (as implemented in China) were substantially more effective at controlling viral
  spread compared to permissive measures (as initially implemented in Italy and the United States). The
  standardized infection rate per million population serves as an index of isolation policy effectiveness.

  variation_notes: Substantial geographic variation observed between China (early aggressive isolation),
    Italy (permissive early measures), and United States (permissive early measures). Chinese policy was
    substantially more effective in controlling infection spread.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism appropriately places responsibility on governmental policy decisions
    rather than individual compliance. The structural determinant is the political decision to implement
    isolation policies and the timing/stringency of those policies. Differential outcomes between countries
    reflect policy choices, not individual behaviors. Equity implications include that populations in
    countries with delayed or weak policy responses experienced greater disease burden regardless of individual
    protective behaviors.
