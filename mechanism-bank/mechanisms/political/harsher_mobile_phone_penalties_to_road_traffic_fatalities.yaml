- 'Step 1: Policy-makers increase penalties (fines, points, license sanctions) for
  mobile phone use violations'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced penalties increase the economic and legal costs of violations,
  strengthening deterrent effect'
- 'Step 3: Stronger deterrence reduces mobile phone use while driving across driver
  population'
- 'Step 4: Reduced distracted driving decreases crash rates and severity, lowering
  road traffic fatalities'
