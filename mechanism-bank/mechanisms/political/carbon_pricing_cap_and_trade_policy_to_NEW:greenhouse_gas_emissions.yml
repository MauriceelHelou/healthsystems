mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carbon pricing policies (carbon taxes or emissions trading systems) establish a monetary cost
  on greenhouse gas emissions'
- 'Step 2: Economic actors internalize the external costs of carbon emissions through increased prices
  for carbon-intensive activities'
- 'Step 3: Higher costs incentivize firms to reduce emissions through technological innovation, fuel switching,
  and efficiency improvements'
- 'Step 4: Reduced emissions lead to immediate and substantial decreases in greenhouse gas output at the
  policy jurisdiction level'

description: Carbon pricing policies yield immediate and substantial emission reductions of 5-21% across
  implemented schemes globally. This meta-analysis of 80 causal evaluations covering 21 carbon pricing
  schemes demonstrates consistent effectiveness despite generally low price levels.

  description: Despite low price levels in most instances, significant emissions reductions were still
    achieved, suggesting even modest pricing has effects

  description: At least 17 of 21 reviewed schemes showed statistically significant emissions reductions,
    indicating scheme design matters
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses climate change through policy-level intervention rather
    than individual behavior change. Carbon pricing represents a structural approach that changes economic
    incentives across entire systems. Climate-related health impacts disproportionately affect low-income
    communities and communities of color through increased heat exposure, air pollution, and climate disasters.
    Reducing emissions through structural policy addresses root causes of environmental health inequities.
