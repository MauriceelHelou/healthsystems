mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of cross-border advertising bans reduces youth exposure to e-cigarette marketing'
- 'Step 2: Health warning requirements on packaging decrease product appeal to young people'
- 'Step 3: Product strength restrictions limit nicotine content available in regulated markets'
- 'Step 4: Reduced accessibility and appeal leads to plateau and potential decline in youth e-cigarette
  experimentation'
- 'Step 5: Change in trend from growth to stabilization in ever-use prevalence among adolescents'

description: The EU Tobacco Products Directive regulations, implemented in May 2016, appear to have halted
  the growth in ever e-cigarette use among adolescents in Great Britain. Prior to implementation, e-cigarette
  ever-use was growing among young people aged 13-15; after implementation, this growth did not continue.
  The change in trend was statistically significant in long-term analysis with an odds ratio of 0.96.

  description: Observations indicated good compliance with regulations, though some retailers reported
    limited information about TPD regulations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how regulatory policy at the structural level can shape
    youth health behaviors. Rather than blaming individual youth for e-cigarette experimentation, the
    intervention targets the commercial and marketing environment that makes these products appealing
    and accessible. The policy approach recognizes that youth tobacco/nicotine use is shaped by commercial
    determinants of health including advertising exposure and product design. Equity implications include
    potential differential effects by socioeconomic status in terms of compliance enforcement in different
    retail environments.
