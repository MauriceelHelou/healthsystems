mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol duties raise retail prices of alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Reduced population-level alcohol consumption due to price sensitivity'
- 'Step 3: Decreased incidence of alcohol-related health conditions (liver disease, cardiovascular effects,
  injuries)'
- 'Step 4: Improved population health outcomes and reduced alcohol-induced mortality'

description: Alcohol taxation policy reduces excessive consumption at the population level, leading to
  well-documented improvements in health outcomes including reduced alcohol-induced mortality, while simultaneously
  generating economic benefits through revenue reinvestment
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: UK-specific modeling; health system characteristics and baseline alcohol consumption
    patterns would affect magnitude of effects in other jurisdictions
moderators:
- name: baseline_consumption_levels
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher baseline excessive alcohol consumption would yield greater health benefits from
    equivalent consumption reductions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism frames alcohol-related health harms as a consequence of structural
    factors (pricing policy, market conditions) rather than individual moral failing. The policy lever
    operates at the system level to change the environment in which consumption decisions occur, recognizing
    that individual 'choices' are constrained by structural conditions.
