mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government prohibits sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages during lockdown periods'
- 'Step 2: Physical availability of alcohol to pregnant women is drastically reduced'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access leads to decreased alcohol consumption among pregnant women'
- 'Step 4: Decreased prenatal alcohol exposure reduces teratogenic effects on fetal development'
- 'Step 5: Incidence and prevalence of Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) potentially reduced'

description: The paper theorizes that alcohol bans during COVID-19 lockdowns could serve as a 'game-changer'
  for FASD prevention in South Africa by reducing prenatal alcohol exposure through structural restriction
  of alcohol availability.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: South Africa has one of the highest FASD prevalence rates globally, making this context
    particularly relevant for observing policy effects
moderators:

  description: Women who know they are pregnant may be more likely to abstain when alcohol is less available
- name: socioeconomic_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Lower-income populations may have less access to alternative alcohol sources, potentially
    seeing greater benefit from bans
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how FASD is produced through structural determinants
    including alcohol marketing, distribution systems, and commercial availability rather than individual
    moral failing. The paper advocates for policy solutions that address these upstream determinants rather
    than focusing on individual pregnant women's behaviors.
