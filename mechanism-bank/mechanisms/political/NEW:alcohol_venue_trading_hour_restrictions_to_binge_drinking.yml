- 'Step 1: Trading hours reduced from 5am to 3am in entertainment districts'
- 'Step 2: Rapid intoxication drinks (shots) banned after midnight'
- 'Step 3: Patrons compensate by consuming more alcohol before entering venues'
- 'Step 4: Breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) at entry to entertainment districts increases substantially'
- 'Step 5: Exit BrAC shows some evidence of increase despite shorter venue operating hours'

description: Alcohol trading hour restrictions were associated with increased overall intoxication levels
  as measured by breath alcohol concentration at entry to entertainment districts. People were substantially
  more inebriated when entering venues after the legislative change, suggesting the policy displaced rather
  than reduced alcohol consumption.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 3993
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Specific to Queensland, Australia nighttime entertainment districts. Two-year baseline
    demonstrated stable preloading rates before legislation, indicating the increase was attributable
    to policy change.

  description: Policy included no new approvals for trading hours beyond 10pm for takeaway alcohol, but
    existing outlets not affected
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding illustrates the complexity of alcohol policy interventions. The structural
    approach of restricting supply (trading hours) did not reduce consumption but shifted it to unregulated
    settings. This highlights the need for comprehensive approaches that address both supply and the social
    determinants of hazardous drinking in young adults. Policy failure occurred due to not adapting to
    cultural patterns specific to the target population.
