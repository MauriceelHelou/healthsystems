mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Police conduct random breath testing checkpoints at various locations throughout the community'
- 'Step 2: Checkpoints create both actual detection risk and perceived risk of apprehension for impaired
  drivers'
- 'Step 3: General deterrence effect reduces decisions to drive after drinking alcohol at the population
  level'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving leads to fewer alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes'
- 'Step 5: Protective effect persists for approximately one week following checkpoint implementation'

description: 'Each additional 10 sobriety checkpoints conducted per week was associated with a 12% decrease
  in alcohol-involved motor vehicle crash incidence at a 1-week lag (IRR=0.88; 95% CI: 0.80-0.97). Over
  the 6.5-year study period in Brisbane, Australia, 2,069 checkpoints were conducted and 3,420 alcohol-related
  crashes occurred. Checkpoint characteristics (size and duration) did not modify this relationship, suggesting
  the presence of checkpoints matters more than their intensity.'

  description: Protective effect observed at 1-week lag but not at 2-week lag, indicating deterrence effect
    diminishes over time without continued enforcement presence
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural/policy intervention (police checkpoint enforcement)
    rather than individual behavior change. The intervention works through environmental modification
    (creating detection risk) rather than targeting individual decision-making in isolation. The finding
    that checkpoint size and duration don't matter suggests resource-efficient deployment is possible,
    which has equity implications for communities with fewer law enforcement resources. The structural
    approach addresses impaired driving through systematic deterrence rather than individual responsibility
    messaging alone. However, checkpoint placement decisions may have differential impacts across communities,
    and enforcement-based approaches can have disparate racial/ethnic impacts that require monitoring.
