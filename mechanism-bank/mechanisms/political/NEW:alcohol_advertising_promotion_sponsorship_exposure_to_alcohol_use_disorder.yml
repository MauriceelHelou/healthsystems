direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: TACs establish operations and market presence in Southeast Asian countries with weak AAPS regulation'
- 'Step 2: Pervasive alcohol marketing through advertising, promotion, and sponsorship activities increases
  population exposure'
- 'Step 3: Marketing influences drinking initiation, frequency, and quantity of consumption'
- 'Step 4: Sustained heavy drinking patterns develop in vulnerable populations exposed to marketing'
- 'Step 5: Increased rates of alcohol-related problems including alcohol use disorder'

    environment, ranging from complete bans in Brunei to voluntary self-regulation in Philippines, Singapore,
    Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism emphasizes structural factors including corporate power, regulatory
    capture, and policy gaps rather than individual susceptibility. The paper explicitly calls for 'stronger
    measures based on scientific evidence of effectiveness that are implemented without interference from
    commercial interests,' identifying commercial influence as a structural barrier to health-protective
    policy.
