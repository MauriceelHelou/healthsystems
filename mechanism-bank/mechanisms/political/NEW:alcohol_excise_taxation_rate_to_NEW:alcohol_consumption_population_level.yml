mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government increases excise duties on alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Tax increase is passed through to consumer prices (full pass-through assumed)'
- 'Step 3: Higher prices reduce demand according to beverage-specific price elasticities'
- 'Step 4: Population-level alcohol consumption decreases, with heavier drinkers showing less elasticity
  than moderate drinkers'

description: Increasing alcohol excise taxation raises consumer prices, which reduces population-level
  alcohol demand through price elasticity mechanisms. The modeling study demonstrates this structural
  intervention's potential to reduce alcohol consumption as an upstream determinant of cancer incidence.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects varied substantially across the 4 countries studied (Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan,
    Sweden) based on baseline taxation levels and consumption patterns. Countries with lower baseline
    excise taxes (Germany, Italy) showed greater potential for cancer reduction.
moderators:
- name: baseline_taxation_level
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Countries with already high excise taxes (like Sweden) have less room for impact from further
    increases
- name: drinking_pattern_heavy_vs_moderate
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Heavy drinkers show less price elasticity than moderate drinkers, meaning taxation is less
    effective at reducing consumption among highest-risk individuals
- name: beverage_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Beverage-specific price elasticities differ, affecting overall impact depending on beverage
    preferences in each country
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention by targeting pricing policy
    rather than individual behavior change. It acknowledges that the environment shapes consumption patterns
    and that fiscal policy is a population-level lever for health improvement. The differential elasticity
    by drinking level highlights equity considerations - while taxation reduces overall consumption, it
    may be less effective for those with alcohol use disorder who have more inelastic demand.
