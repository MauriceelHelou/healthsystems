mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative impact zones limit new alcohol outlet licenses in high-density areas'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability decreases opportunities for excessive alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower population-level intoxication reduces alcohol-facilitated sexual violence'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-attributable sexual offense rates decline in policy-intensive areas'

description: Alcohol licensing policies restricting spatial availability were associated with stronger
  declines in alcohol-attributable sexual offenses. Areas with intense policies saw declines of 0.10 per
  1000 population compared to 0.01 per 1000 in passive policy areas from 2009-2013.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses sexual violence through environmental modification rather
    than victim-focused interventions. By reducing alcohol availability, the policy targets a key facilitating
    factor in sexual violence without placing responsibility on potential victims. This structural approach
    recognizes the role of alcohol environments in enabling sexual violence.
