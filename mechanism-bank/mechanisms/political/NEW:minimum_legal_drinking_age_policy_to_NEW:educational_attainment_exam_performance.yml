  development.

  description: European countries with high youth drinking rates may see larger educational benefits from
    MLDA policies
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how alcohol policy has cascading effects on educational
    equity. Structural protection of adolescents from alcohol exposure promotes educational attainment,
    with potential implications for reducing socioeconomic inequalities that correlate with both youth
    drinking and educational outcomes.
