description: The study demonstrates that public discourse and justifications put forward for monopolies
  differ across sectors, with gambling monopoly benefiting from stronger consensus politics and aligned
  stakeholder interests compared to alcohol and rail sectors. This discursive environment contributes
  to differential policy sustainability.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how political discourse and stakeholder configurations
    shape health-protective policies at the structural level. The analysis avoids individual blame by
    focusing on how political-economic systems produce different policy outcomes. Equity implications
    relate to how policy sustainability affects population-level exposure to potentially harmful products.
