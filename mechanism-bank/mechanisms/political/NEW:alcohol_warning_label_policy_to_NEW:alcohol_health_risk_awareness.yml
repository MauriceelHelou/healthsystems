- 'Step 1: Mandatory warning labels on alcohol products increase visibility of health risk information
  at point of purchase'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure to health warnings during purchasing and consumption increases awareness
  of alcohol-related health risks'
- 'Step 3: Increased awareness shifts social norms around acceptable drinking levels'
- 'Step 4: Population-level changes in consumption patterns and reduced alcohol-attributable disease burden'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Warning label policies represent structural intervention by mandating information
    provision at point of sale, addressing information asymmetry between alcohol industry and consumers.
    This approach recognizes that individual 'informed choice' requires structural supports to counter
    industry marketing.
