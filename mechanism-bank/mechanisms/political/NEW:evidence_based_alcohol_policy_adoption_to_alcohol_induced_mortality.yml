mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Evidence-based alcohol policies (pricing, availability restrictions, marketing controls) are
  adopted by government'
- 'Step 2: Policies reduce population-level alcohol availability, affordability, and promotional exposure'
- 'Step 3: Reduced exposure leads to decreased population alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption levels reduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality'

description: Evidence-based alcohol policies, when adopted, reduce alcohol-related harm at the population
  level. However, the paper documents how industry actors systematically work to prevent adoption of such
  policies through strategic misuse of scientific evidence, creating a structural barrier to reducing
  alcohol-induced mortality.

    reduces likelihood and strength of evidence-based policy adoption
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism connects political/regulatory structures to health outcomes, demonstrating
    how corporate influence shapes the policy environment that determines population health. The failure
    to adopt evidence-based policies is a structural failure, not an individual one. Communities with
    less political power to advocate for health-protective policies bear disproportionate burden of alcohol-related
    harm.
