- 'Step 1: MUP policy increases cost of cheap alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Price increases reduce alcohol availability and consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced intoxication decreases alcohol-related violence and antisocial behavior'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption reduces workplace absenteeism and productivity losses'
- 'Step 5: Overall reduction in wider social harms associated with alcohol use'

description: The systematic review included evidence on wider harms beyond direct health effects, finding
  that minimum pricing policies reduce broader social harms associated with alcohol through the price-consumption
  pathway.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Wider harms include crime, violence, workplace impacts; evidence varies across different
    harm categories
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism captures the broader societal benefits of alcohol pricing policy,
    including reduced violence, crime, and economic productivity losses. These wider harms disproportionately
    affect marginalized communities and families of people with alcohol use disorders.
