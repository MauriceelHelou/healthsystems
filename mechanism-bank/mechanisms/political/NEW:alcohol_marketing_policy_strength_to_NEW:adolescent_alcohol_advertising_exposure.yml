mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stronger alcohol marketing policies restrict the channels, timing, and content of alcohol advertisements'
- 'Step 2: Reduced availability of alcohol advertising across media platforms (television, radio, digital,
  outdoor)'
- 'Step 3: Decreased frequency of adolescent encounters with alcohol marketing messages'
- 'Step 4: Lower cumulative exposure to alcohol advertising among school-aged youth'

description: Stronger alcohol marketing policies at the country level are associated with reduced adolescent
  exposure to alcohol advertising. This cross-national analysis of 47,195 adolescents aged 11-16 years
  from 13 Latin American countries found a significant inverse relationship between marketing policy strength
  and self-reported alcohol advertising exposure, controlling for individual and country-level factors.

  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies how policy-level interventions can protect youth from
    commercial determinants of health. The finding that lower SES adolescents face greater alcohol advertising
    exposure highlights an equity concern - marketing regulations may disproportionately benefit disadvantaged
    youth who are otherwise more heavily targeted. The study supports structural interventions (marketing
    bans/restrictions) rather than individual-level approaches to reducing youth alcohol exposure, aligning
    with WHO sustainable development goals.
