mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: TAPS bans reduce exposure to tobacco marketing that reinforces continued smoking'
- 'Step 2: Reduced marketing presence may decrease cues that trigger smoking behavior and undermine quit
  attempts'
- 'Step 3: However, TAPS bans may not directly address nicotine dependence or provide cessation support'
- 'Step 4: The pathway from reduced marketing to actual cessation may require additional interventions'

description: TAPS bans showed no significant association with smoking cessation (OR=1.10, 95% CI 0.86-1.40).
  This null finding suggests that while TAPS bans effectively prevent initiation and reduce prevalence,
  they may not directly facilitate quitting among established smokers.

  equity_implications: This null finding is important for policy design - it indicates that TAPS bans,
    while effective for prevention, may need to be complemented by cessation support services and treatments
    to help current smokers quit. This highlights that comprehensive tobacco control requires multiple
    structural interventions addressing different stages of the smoking trajectory. The differential effects
    across outcomes (strong for initiation, weaker for cessation) inform resource allocation and policy
    prioritization.
