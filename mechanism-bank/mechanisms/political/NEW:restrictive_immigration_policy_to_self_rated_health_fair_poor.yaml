direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of restrictive immigration policies creates structural barriers
  that limit immigrants'' access to healthcare, employment, housing, and social services'
- 'Step 2: Fear of deportation and documentation requirements lead to reduced utilization
  of available health services and social support systems among immigrant populations'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from immigration enforcement, family separation concerns,
  and social marginalization affects mental and physical health through psychosocial
  pathways'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to structural determinants of health (stable employment,
  housing, education) compounds health disadvantages'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative exposure to these stressors and barriers manifests as increased
  likelihood of reporting fair or poor self-rated health among affected populations'

description: Restrictive immigration policies contribute to poorer self-rated health
  among immigrant populations through multiple structural pathways. These policies
  restrict access to healthcare, employment, and social services while simultaneously
  creating chronic psychosocial stress through fear of deportation and family separation.
  The systematic review found demonstrable harms from policies that restrict immigration
  access, affecting the structural determinants of health and daily living conditions
  for racialized immigrant populations.
