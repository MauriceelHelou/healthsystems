description: The systematic review concludes that policies which restrict advertising may be an effective
  way to reduce alcohol use, based on evidence linking marketing to consumption. Four reviews documented
  industry preference for self-regulation over external restrictions.

  description: The alcohol industry shows strong desire to self-regulate, which may reduce effectiveness
    of policy restrictions through weaker implementation or enforcement
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies advertising restrictions as a structural policy lever
    operating upstream of individual behavior. The finding that industry strongly prefers self-regulation
    over external restrictions highlights the political economy of alcohol policy and potential conflicts
    of interest in regulatory frameworks. Evidence supports structural policy intervention over individual-focused
    approaches.
