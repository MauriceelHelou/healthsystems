mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Initiative 1183 removes state monopoly on liquor retail and distribution'
- 'Step 2: Private retailers expand liquor availability through increased outlet density'
- 'Step 3: Increased access to higher-proof alcohol (liquor vs beer/wine) shifts purchasing patterns'
- 'Step 4: Total ethanol (pure alcohol) consumption increases across the household alcohol portfolio'
- 'Step 5: Monthly total ethanol purchases increase by approximately 26%'

description: Liquor privatization was associated with a 2.01-ounce increase in monthly total ethanol purchases
  per household (approximately 26% increase), indicating that policy changes in alcohol retail structure
  affect not just liquor-specific purchasing but overall alcohol consumption measured as pure ethanol

  description: Low and moderate purchasers showed increased ethanol purchases while high purchasers showed
    decreased ethanol purchases in longitudinal subgroup analysis
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how state alcohol control policy functions as a structural
    determinant of population alcohol exposure. The conversion to total ethanol captures the public health
    significance beyond just liquor volume. The differential effects by baseline consumption level raise
    equity concerns - policies that increase consumption among light/moderate drinkers while only reducing
    among heavy drinkers may have complex population health implications
