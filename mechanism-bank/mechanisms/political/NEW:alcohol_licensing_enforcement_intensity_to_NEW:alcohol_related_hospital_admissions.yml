direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local government increases enforcement of existing alcohol licensing regulations'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced enforcement ensures compliance with trading hours, service to intoxicated persons,
  and underage sales'
- 'Step 3: Licensed premises modify practices to avoid penalties and license revocation'
- 'Step 4: Reduced over-service and irresponsible trading decreases hazardous drinking occasions'
- 'Step 5: Population-level alcohol-related harms and hospitalizations decline'

description: Increased licensing enforcement, when combined with cumulative impact zones, contributed
  to the observed 6.3% reduction in alcohol-related hospital admissions. The study design required both
  policy components, suggesting enforcement intensity amplifies the effect of zoning restrictions.

  description: Enforcement was combined with cumulative impact zones; the combined intervention showed
    effects while prior evidence of enforcement alone was weak
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Enforcement of alcohol regulations represents a structural mechanism through which
    local governments can influence the commercial alcohol environment. This approach addresses the supply
    side of alcohol availability through regulatory compliance rather than demand-side individual behavior
    change. The need for combined interventions (zoning + enforcement) highlights that multiple policy
    levers may be required for meaningful population health impact.
