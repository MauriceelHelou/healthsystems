description: Regulatory enforcement capacity, including inspector organization and inter-party communication,
  determines the effectiveness of occupational health protections. The synthesis identified inspector
  organization as one of four key themes affecting OHS outcomes.

  variation_notes: Enforcement capacity and implementation varies significantly across countries; studies
    primarily from Australia and Canada may not generalize to other contexts

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism focuses on state capacity and regulatory infrastructure rather than
    individual worker or employer behavior. It highlights how inadequate enforcement systems (a structural
    factor) allow preventable workplace injuries to occur. The mechanism avoids blaming workers for safety
    failures and instead points to systemic gaps.
