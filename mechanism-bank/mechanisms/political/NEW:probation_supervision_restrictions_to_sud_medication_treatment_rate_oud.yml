description: Probation departments create structural barriers to medication-assisted treatment for opioid
  use disorder through organizational regulations, lack of staff training, and negative attitudes toward
  medications, preventing clients from accessing FDA-approved treatments despite strong evidence of effectiveness.

  sample_size: 26
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study focused on Illinois probation departments, noting variations in regulations set
    by organization or jurisdiction that prohibit client use of medications

  description: Probation department leaders were less open to methadone referrals compared to buprenorphine
    or naltrexone, suggesting differential barriers by medication type
- name: staff_training_level
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Lack of medical personnel experience and need for guidance on medications increases barriers;
    training could reduce them
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how criminal justice system policies and practices create
    health inequities for justice-involved populations. The barriers are structural (organizational regulations,
    lack of institutional training, cost) rather than individual failings. Probation clients face differential
    access to evidence-based healthcare due to their criminal justice status, representing a form of structural
    discrimination that affects a disproportionately low-income and minority population.
