description: This systematic review examines how regulatory frameworks for high-risk medical devices create
  structural barriers to patient access. The European Medical Device Regulation has increased clinical
  evidence requirements, and unlike USA, China, and Canada which have conditional approval schemes allowing
  market access while generating additional evidence, Europe relies on certificate restrictions. This
  regulatory structure affects which devices reach patients and when.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The paper explicitly compares regulatory approaches across United States, China, Canada,
    and Europe, finding that conditional approval pathways exist in USA, China, and Canada but Europe
    relies on restrictions/limitations to certificates instead.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how regulatory policy structures create differential
    access to medical innovations. The focus is appropriately on structural/policy factors rather than
    individual choices. The equity implication is that patients in different jurisdictions may have differential
    access to promising medical devices based solely on where they live, which represents a structural
    determinant of healthcare access.
