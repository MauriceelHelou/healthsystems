mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Law enforcement agencies allocate resources to drink-driving enforcement operations'
- 'Step 2: Enforcement activities (checkpoints, patrols, random breath testing) increase probability of
  detection for impaired drivers'
- 'Step 3: Publicized enforcement creates awareness and perceived risk among potential drink-drivers'
- 'Step 4: General deterrence effect reduces willingness to drive after drinking'
- 'Step 5: Population-level reduction in drink-driving behavior'

description: The systematic review found that most included studies demonstrated sustained enforcement
  was associated with reductions in drink driving behavior, though the heterogeneity in dosage measures
  and study designs limited the ability to determine an optimal enforcement level. The review highlights
  the need for additional research with rigorous study designs to help law enforcement agencies make evidence-based
  resource allocation decisions.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The 21 included studies differed substantially in their measures of enforcement dosage,
    making it difficult to synthesize results across studies and determine threshold levels.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism frames drink-driving as a population-level phenomenon amenable to
    structural policy intervention rather than purely individual moral failing. The review appropriately
    focuses on how policy enforcement resources are allocated as a systems-level determinant. However,
    the mechanism does not address potential equity concerns including differential enforcement across
    communities, or how underlying structural factors (alcohol availability, transportation alternatives,
    economic stress) may contribute to drink-driving behavior in the first place.
