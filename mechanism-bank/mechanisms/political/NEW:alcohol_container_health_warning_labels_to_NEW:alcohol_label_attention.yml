direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy implementation requires enhanced health messages on alcohol containers including cancer
  warnings, drinking guidelines, and standard drink information'
- 'Step 2: Strengthened labels with salient health information increase visual prominence and relevance
  to consumers'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced label design and content capture consumer attention during purchase and consumption
  occasions'
- 'Step 4: Increased attention facilitates cognitive engagement with health messaging'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural policy intervention that modifies the commercial
    environment rather than relying on individual education or willpower. The policy shifts responsibility
    from individuals to the regulatory environment, creating population-level exposure to health information
    at point of purchase/consumption. This addresses information asymmetry where alcohol industry marketing
    dominates consumer messaging.
