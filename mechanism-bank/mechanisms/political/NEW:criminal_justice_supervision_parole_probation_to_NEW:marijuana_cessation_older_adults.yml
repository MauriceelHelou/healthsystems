description: Parole/probation status was associated with higher likelihood of use-to-nonuse among older
  adults, indicating that criminal justice supervision creates structural pressure for marijuana cessation
  through surveillance and legal consequences.

  description: In states with legalized marijuana, parole/probation supervision may have less impact on
    cessation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how the criminal justice system functions as a structural
    determinant of substance use behavior. The finding raises equity concerns as criminal justice involvement
    disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Cessation driven by surveillance rather than
    treatment may not reflect meaningful recovery.
