mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy mandates health warning labels on alcoholic beverage containers and marketing'
- 'Step 2: Warning labels communicate health risks (liver disease, cancer, addiction) at point of purchase
  decision'
- 'Step 3: Risk information reduces product attractiveness and disrupts automatic purchasing behavior'
- 'Step 4: Reduced selection of alcohol products decreases availability for consumption occasions'
- 'Step 5: Decreased alcohol availability and selection reduces episodes of excessive drinking'

description: Health warning labels on alcohol products show potential to reduce alcohol selection, with
  3 RCTs included in the systematic review. The overall meta-analysis effect (RR=0.74) suggests meaningful
  reduction in selection behavior that could translate to reduced harmful drinking patterns.

  description: Image-and-text HWLs appear more effective than text-only, suggesting visual depictions
    of health consequences may enhance impact
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol warning labels represent a population-level policy intervention that addresses
    the commercial determinants of health by countering alcohol industry marketing. This structural approach
    recognizes that alcohol-related harm is shaped by environmental factors including marketing, availability,
    and information asymmetry rather than individual choice alone. Implementation could reduce alcohol-related
    health disparities if labels are designed to be accessible across literacy levels and languages.
