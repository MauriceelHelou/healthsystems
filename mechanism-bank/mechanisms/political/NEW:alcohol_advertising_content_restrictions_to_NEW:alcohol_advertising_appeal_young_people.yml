direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restrictive alcohol advertising laws (like France''s Évin law) limit content to purely factual
  product information (bottles, logos only)'
- 'Step 2: Removal of contextual imagery (party scenes, sports, attractive characters) reduces emotional
  and aspirational associations with alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Neutral advertising generates less attention, lower appeal ratings, and reduced perceived image
  benefits compared to contextual ads'
- 'Step 4: Decreased advertising attractiveness reduces positive perceptions of alcohol products among
  young people'
- 'Step 5: Lower perceived behavioral impact and reduced intention to consume alcohol among exposed youth'

description: France's Évin law restricts alcohol advertising content to purely factual product information.
  This experimental study demonstrates that neutral ads (bottles and logos only) generate significantly
  less positive reactions, lower appeal, and reduced perceived behavioral impact compared to contextual
  ads featuring party/sport imagery or characters. Women and younger adults (18-21) showed greatest sensitivity
  to contextual content, suggesting content restrictions particularly protect vulnerable youth subgroups.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies how regulatory policy can modify the commercial determinants
    of health. Rather than blaming young people for being susceptible to alcohol marketing, the Évin law
    addresses the upstream structural factor of advertising content itself. The policy removes the industry's
    ability to create aspirational and emotional associations with alcohol consumption, thereby reducing
    exposure to persuasive marketing tactics that disproportionately affect young and vulnerable populations.
    This represents a structural intervention that shifts responsibility from individuals resisting marketing
    to regulation of corporate practices.
