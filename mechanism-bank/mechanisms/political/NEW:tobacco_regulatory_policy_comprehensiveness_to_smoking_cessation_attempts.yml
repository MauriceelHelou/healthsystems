mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Comprehensive menthol cigarette restrictions include coverage of accessories and synthetic
  coolant alternatives'
- 'Step 2: Reduced availability of menthol-delivering products across all product categories'
- 'Step 3: Menthol smokers face reduced substitution options when preferred products restricted'
- 'Step 4: Increased motivation for cessation attempts when palatable alternatives unavailable'

description: The study underscores that partial menthol restrictions allow tobacco industry circumvention
  through alternative products. Comprehensive policies covering all menthol-delivering products (accessories
  and synthetic coolant cigarettes) are necessary to maximize public health benefit and potentially increase
  cessation among menthol smokers.

  description: Higher nicotine dependence associated with greater awareness, use, and substitution intentions,
    suggesting more dependent smokers will seek alternatives more actively
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural policy design rather than individual smoker
    behavior. The finding that 80.2% intend to substitute with accessories and 56% with cooling cigarettes
    demonstrates that without comprehensive regulation, industry will provide workarounds that maintain
    smoking. Equity implications are significant given historical targeting of menthol products to Black
    communities.
