direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Robust housing code enforcement ensures compliance with minimum housing standards'
- 'Step 2: Code compliance mandates adequate ventilation, moisture control, and structural integrity'
- 'Step 3: Improved housing conditions reduce environmental triggers (mold, dampness, allergens)'
- 'Step 4: Reduced trigger exposure decreases respiratory inflammation and symptom frequency'
- 'Step 5: Overall improvement in pediatric respiratory health outcomes'

description: Housing code enforcement represents a policy intervention that can improve pediatric respiratory
  health by mandating structural conditions that reduce environmental respiratory triggers.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how political will and resource allocation for code
    enforcement directly impacts child health outcomes. Weak enforcement disproportionately affects low-income
    communities and communities of color where political power is limited, perpetuating health inequities
    through policy neglect.
