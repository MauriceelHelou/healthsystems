description: The study found that some public health stakeholders adopted a 'supportive' approach focused
  on short-term outcomes other than health, such as crime reduction. This represents an adaptation to
  licensing system constraints where health is not a primary objective, but crime prevention is. While
  this may achieve some public safety goals, it represents a diminished focus on direct population health
  outcomes from alcohol consumption.

  description: When public health goals align with existing licensing objectives (crime prevention), engagement
    may be more accepted but diverted from health outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding illustrates how institutional structures shape and potentially co-opt
    public health action. When licensing systems prioritize crime/disorder over health, public health
    teams may adapt their goals accordingly. This represents goal displacement driven by structural constraints
    rather than optimal public health strategy. From an equity perspective, crime-focused approaches may
    disproportionately affect marginalized communities through increased enforcement rather than addressing
    underlying health determinants.
