structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses the commercial infrastructure that enables alcohol sales
    to circumvent traditional regulatory controls. By targeting the digital marketplace structure rather
    than consumer behavior, this approach recognizes that online sales create new vectors for harmful
    consumption that require structural policy responses.
