structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism frames substance use disorder as a structural and health issue rather
    than a criminal one. Diversion recognizes that incarceration exacerbates substance use disorders while
    treatment-oriented approaches address root causes. The criminal justice system's intersection with
    substance use represents a policy lever for improving population health outcomes.
