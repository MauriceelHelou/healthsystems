- 'Step 1: Lack of accountability mechanisms for Licensing Boards reduces enforcement of public health
  objectives in licensing decisions'
- 'Step 2: Licensing Boards operate autonomously from broader alcohol policy implementation system'
- 'Step 3: Tension develops between legislative intent (public health goals) and enacted licensing practices'
- 'Step 4: This systemic gap perpetuates alcohol-related harms and health inequalities'

    achievement of public health goals
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies a fundamental structural failure in policy implementation
    governance. The issue is not individual behavior but institutional design that allows regulatory bodies
    to operate without accountability to public health objectives. This creates systematic barriers to
    reducing alcohol-related health inequities.
