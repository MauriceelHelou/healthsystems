to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking
  node_name: Binge Drinking
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Governments implement strong AAPS control policies including complete or comprehensive bans'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol marketing exposure decreases social normalization of drinking'
- 'Step 3: Lower exposure to alcohol promotion reduces drinking initiation rates especially among youth'
- 'Step 4: Population-level alcohol consumption decreases'
- 'Step 5: Reduced rates of harmful drinking patterns including binge drinking'

description: Strong regulatory control of alcohol advertising, promotion, and sponsorship reduces population
  exposure to alcohol marketing, which is associated with lower rates of alcohol consumption and binge
  drinking
spatial_variation:

  variation_notes: Strong control observed in Brunei (complete ban), Indonesia, Myanmar, Laos (almost
    comprehensive bans), and Thailand (partial ban); weak/nonexistent control in Philippines, Singapore,
    Cambodia, Malaysia, and Vietnam

    comprehensive approaches more effective than narrow restrictions

    effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies regulatory policy as a structural lever for improving
    population health. The protective effect of strong AAPS regulation represents a policy intervention
    that addresses commercial determinants of health rather than targeting individual behavior change.
    Countries with fewer resources may face greater challenges implementing and enforcing comprehensive
    bans.
