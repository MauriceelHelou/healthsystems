description: The systematic review identifies a critical gap in international PRO-specific guidance for
  RWE generation in regulatory and policy contexts. Currently, guidance for clinical care use of PROs
  exists, but unique aspects for regulatory decision-making, reimbursement, and health policy need differentiation
  to ensure interventions are properly evaluated from patient perspectives.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural inequity in evidence systems - without standardized
    PRO guidance, patient voices may be inconsistently incorporated into regulatory and reimbursement
    decisions. This creates potential for systematic bias in which interventions receive approval and
    funding, potentially disadvantaging populations whose health outcomes are less well-captured by traditional
    clinical endpoints. The call for stakeholder-inclusive guidance development represents a structural
    approach to democratizing health policy evidence.
