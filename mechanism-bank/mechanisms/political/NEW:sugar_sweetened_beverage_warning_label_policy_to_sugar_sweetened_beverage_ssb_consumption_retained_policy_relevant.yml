direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Front-of-pack warning labels on SSBs provide visible sugar content information at point of
  purchase'
- 'Step 2: Labels perceived as credible and informative increase consumer awareness of sugar quantities
  (e.g., teaspoon equivalents)'
- 'Step 3: Personal relevance of information (especially for parents making choices for children) enhances
  motivation to reduce purchases'
- 'Step 4: Reduced SSB purchasing leads to decreased household SSB consumption'

description: Front-of-pack warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages, particularly those showing sugar
  content in teaspoons, are perceived as credible, informative, and personally relevant by parents, with
  potential to change purchasing behavior and reduce SSB consumption. The text teaspoons format was most
  favorably received across effectiveness themes.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural policy intervention that modifies the information
    environment at point of purchase rather than relying on individual knowledge-seeking. It addresses
    the information asymmetry between beverage manufacturers and consumers. The study's stratification
    by education level acknowledges that health literacy disparities may affect label comprehension, highlighting
    equity implications. Policy-level labeling requirements shift responsibility from individual consumers
    to regulatory systems.
