- 'Step 1: Worker representation through unions provides advocacy for OHS protections in policy formation'
- 'Step 2: Unions bring either technical expertise or worksite-based legitimacy to OHS negotiations'
- 'Step 3: Stronger worker voice in OHS systems leads to more comprehensive coverage and enforcement'
- 'Step 4: Greater coverage translates to improved workers compensation and occupational health protections'

description: Worker representation is identified as one of four key themes in OHS regulation. Union involvement
  in OHS systems influences the strength and coverage of occupational health protections, though economic
  constraints can limit union effectiveness.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the role of collective worker power in shaping health-protective
    policies, emphasizing structural labor relations rather than individual worker advocacy. It notes
    how economic conditions constrain worker voice, revealing how macro-economic forces create health
    inequities through reduced labor protections.
