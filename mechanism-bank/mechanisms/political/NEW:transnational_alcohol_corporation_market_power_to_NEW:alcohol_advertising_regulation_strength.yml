structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies corporate power as a structural determinant of regulatory
    policy, which in turn affects population health. The paper explicitly notes the need for policies
    'implemented without interference from commercial interests,' recognizing that corporate influence
    is a barrier to evidence-based public health policy. This represents a commercial determinants of
    health framework that locates responsibility at the systemic rather than individual level.
