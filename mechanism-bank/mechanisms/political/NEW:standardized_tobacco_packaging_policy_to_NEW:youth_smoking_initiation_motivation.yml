description: Findings with youth generally pointed towards standardized packs being less likely to motivate
  smoking initiation than branded packs. However, few studies directly assessed behavioral outcomes in
  youth and non-smokers, limiting certainty.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism is particularly important for health equity as tobacco industry
    marketing has historically targeted youth, especially in disadvantaged communities. Removing branded
    packaging as a marketing vector provides structural protection for vulnerable youth populations.
