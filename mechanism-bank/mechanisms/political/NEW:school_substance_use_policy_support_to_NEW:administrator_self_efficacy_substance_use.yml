direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Insufficient policy guidance and evidence-aligned resources leave administrators without effective
  frameworks'
- 'Step 2: Administrators report feeling unequipped despite high willingness to change practices (64.7%)'
- 'Step 3: Gap between willingness and capacity reflects structural under-investment in school health
  infrastructure'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced policy support and evidence-based resources would increase administrator capacity
  and self-efficacy'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly identifies policy and resource gaps as root causes rather
    than administrator or student deficits. The study purpose was to inform evidence-based guidance development
    - acknowledging that structural interventions (policy, training, resources) are needed. This reframes
    school substance use as a systems challenge requiring systemic solutions rather than punitive individual-level
    responses.
