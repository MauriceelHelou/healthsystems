direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy implementation requires specific cancer warnings on alcohol containers'
- 'Step 2: Cancer warnings communicate established causal link between alcohol consumption and cancer'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to cancer warnings at point of consumption increases awareness'
- 'Step 4: Increased awareness of cancer risk may enhance motivation for risk reduction behaviors'

description: The intervention specifically included cancer warnings on alcohol labels, addressing the
  documented gap in public awareness of the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer
  risk.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Cancer warning labels were specific to the Yukon intervention; most jurisdictions globally
    lack alcohol-cancer warning requirements

  description: Those with lower baseline awareness of alcohol-cancer link may show greater information
    gains
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses a structural information asymmetry where the alcohol-cancer
    link, despite strong scientific evidence, remains poorly known among the public. The alcohol industry
    has historically avoided disclosing cancer risks. This policy intervention corrects market failure
    in health information disclosure and has equity implications as cancer risk from alcohol disproportionately
    affects heavy drinkers who may cluster in lower socioeconomic groups.
