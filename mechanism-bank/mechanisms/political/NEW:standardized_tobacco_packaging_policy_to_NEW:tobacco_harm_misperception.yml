- 'Step 1: Branded packaging uses color coding and design to suggest some products are ''lighter'' or
  less harmful'
- 'Step 2: Standardized packaging removes these misleading visual cues'
- 'Step 3: Uniform dark coloring particularly effective at eliminating harm hierarchy perceptions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced misperceptions that some cigarettes are less harmful than others'

description: Standardized packaging reduced misperceptions that some cigarettes are less harmful than
  others, but this effect was observed only when dark colors were used for the uniform pack color. This
  addresses tobacco industry tactics of using lighter colors to imply reduced harm.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism directly counters tobacco industry practices that exploit consumer
    psychology to maintain the false belief that some cigarettes are safer. It represents a structural
    intervention to correct market-induced misinformation.
