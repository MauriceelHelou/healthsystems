mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tighter restriction criteria for opioid medication subsidization through PBS limit access to
  subsidized opioid prescriptions'
- 'Step 2: Financial and administrative barriers reduce overall volume of opioid prescriptions dispensed'
- 'Step 3: Reduced opioid prescribing decreases population-level exposure to prescription opioids'
- 'Step 4: Lower opioid availability reduces opportunities for misuse, dependence development, and overdose'
- 'Step 5: Opioid-related emergency department presentations decrease among people prescribed opioids'

description: Tighter restriction criteria for PBS subsidization of opioid medications, implemented June
  2020, contributed to declining opioid-related ED presentations. The combined policy intervention of
  mandatory monitoring and PBS restrictions demonstrated that supply-side policies can reduce opioid-related
  harm.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism operates through pharmaceutical policy and subsidy structures rather
    than individual decision-making. It addresses the economic and regulatory environment that shapes
    opioid availability. The policy intervention targets systemic factors in medication access rather
    than stigmatizing individuals with opioid use disorders.
