structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Point-of-sale tobacco marketing is a structural determinant of tobacco use, particularly
    among youth. Vendor indifference to TAPS restrictions reflects the need for enforcement mechanisms
    and potentially alternative revenue streams to replace tobacco industry promotional incentives.
