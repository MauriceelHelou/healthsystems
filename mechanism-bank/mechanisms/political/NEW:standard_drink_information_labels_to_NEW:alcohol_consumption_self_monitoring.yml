  description: Ability to interpret standard drink information and apply to drinking guidelines may vary

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Standard drink labeling addresses structural barriers to informed consumption by
    making alcohol content transparent and comparable. Current labeling practices often obscure actual
    alcohol content, making it difficult for consumers to adhere to drinking guidelines even when motivated.
    This intervention removes information barriers that disproportionately affect those without specialized
    knowledge of alcohol content.
