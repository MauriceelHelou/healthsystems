description: COVID-19 prompted flexibility in programmatic requirements for SUD treatment, which particularly
  benefited rural clients on community supervision who faced unique barriers to meeting standard program
  requirements.

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Flexibility with programmatic requirements was identified as a rural-specific theme,
    indicating differential policy application based on geographic context.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how rigid policy requirements can create inequitable
    barriers that disproportionately affect rural populations. The finding suggests that pre-pandemic
    programmatic structures may have been designed without adequate consideration of rural constraints,
    representing a structural equity issue in criminal justice and treatment policy design.
