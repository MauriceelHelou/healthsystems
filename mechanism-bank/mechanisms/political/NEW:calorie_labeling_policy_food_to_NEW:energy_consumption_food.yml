direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Calorie labeling policies mandate display of energy information on menus and food products'
- 'Step 2: Consumers see calorie information when selecting food items'
- 'Step 3: Selection of lower-calorie food options leads to reduced energy available for consumption'
- 'Step 4: Consumers may also moderate portion consumption based on calorie awareness'
- 'Step 5: Total energy consumed from food decreases at population level'

description: Calorie labeling of food may lead to a larger reduction in energy consumed compared to energy
  selected. For an average 600 kcal meal, adults exposed to calorie labeling consume approximately 35
  kcal less (5.9% reduction). However, this evidence is of lower certainty compared to selection outcomes.

  variation_notes: Studies primarily conducted in high-income countries. Evidence for consumption outcome
    is less extensive than for selection outcome.

  description: Potential effect modification by SES identified as priority for further research; current
    evidence predominantly from high-SES populations.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The consumption effect is larger than the selection effect, suggesting calorie
    labeling may influence both what people choose and how much they eat. This structural intervention
    operates at the environmental level, potentially creating population-wide health benefits when applied
    at scale. The low-certainty evidence rating reflects fewer studies and potential for bias, requiring
    cautious interpretation.
