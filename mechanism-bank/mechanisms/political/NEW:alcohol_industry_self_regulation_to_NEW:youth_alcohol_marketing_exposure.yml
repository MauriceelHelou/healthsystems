structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies regulatory capture and policy failure as structural determinants.
    The blurring of lines between commercial marketing and user-generated content represents a structural
    challenge that individual consumers cannot navigate. Equity implications include disproportionate
    impact on youth and populations with higher social media usage who face greater cumulative exposure.
