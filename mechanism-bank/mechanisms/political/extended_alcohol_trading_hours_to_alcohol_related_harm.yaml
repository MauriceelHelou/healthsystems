direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative extensions of permitted hours of alcohol sale expand temporal
  availability of alcohol in licensed venues'
- 'Step 2: Increased hours of operation extend the window during which alcohol can
  be purchased and consumed, particularly during late-night high-risk periods'
- 'Step 3: Extended drinking opportunities lead to higher overall alcohol consumption
  and more sustained intoxication levels'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged exposure to intoxicated environments and extended periods of
  high blood alcohol concentration increase risk of alcohol-related harms including
  violence'
