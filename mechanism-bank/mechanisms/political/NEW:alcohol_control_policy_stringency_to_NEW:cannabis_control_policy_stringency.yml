mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local governments develop regulatory frameworks for alcohol sales including hours of sale,
  advertising restrictions, and outlet density limits'
- 'Step 2: When cannabis is legalized, localities with established stringent alcohol policies have institutional
  capacity and political will for substance regulation'
- 'Step 3: Regulatory infrastructure and policy expertise transfers to cannabis control decisions'
- 'Step 4: More stringent alcohol policy environments correlate with more stringent cannabis policy adoption'

description: Among California localities that permitted cannabis sales, more stringent local alcohol control
  policies were associated with more stringent cannabis control policies, suggesting potential policy
  learning and regulatory capacity transfer between substances.

  description: Association only observed among localities that did not ban cannabis sales (29% of sample);
    71% banned cannabis entirely regardless of alcohol policy
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies how local government regulatory capacity and political
    will for substance control policies may transfer across substances. However, the finding that most
    localities banned cannabis regardless of alcohol policy suggests political factors beyond public health
    considerations drive decisions.
