mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-existing dual-track insurance system created structural inequality in healthcare access'
- 'Step 2: Policy integration harmonizes coverage, benefits, and reimbursement across geographic lines'
- 'Step 3: Financial barriers to healthcare are equalized between urban and rural populations'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare utilization patterns converge as rural residents gain equivalent access'
- 'Step 5: Health outcome disparities narrow as differential access is eliminated'

description: The URRBMI policy reduced the urban-rural gap in chronic disease odds ratios from 0.30 to
  0.03, demonstrating how insurance policy integration can substantially reduce geographic health inequities.
  This represents progress toward universal health coverage goals.
quantitative_effects:

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: The odds ratio difference between rural and urban populations decreased from 0.30 prior
    to policy to 0.03 after policy implementation, demonstrating substantial reduction in geographic health
    disparities.

  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how policy-level structural interventions can dismantle
    institutionalized health inequities. The pre-existing system reflected cumulative disadvantage for
    rural populations - not individual choices but systematic exclusion from equitable healthcare. The
    dramatic reduction in the urban-rural gap demonstrates that health disparities are not inevitable
    but are products of policy choices that can be reversed through structural reform. This finding has
    implications for other segmented healthcare systems globally.
