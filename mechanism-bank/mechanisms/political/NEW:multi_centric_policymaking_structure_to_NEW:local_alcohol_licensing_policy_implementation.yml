- 'Step 4: Public health actors face unfamiliar processes and evidence requirements at local level'

description: This study examines how public health objectives embedded in national alcohol licensing legislation
  face obstacles when translated to local policy implementation in Scotland. Despite national commitment
  to public health outcomes, local licensing boards operate with different conventions, priorities, and
  evidence standards. Public health actors identified challenges including unfamiliar stakeholders and
  decision-making cultures, resource constraints, data gaps, and boards' prioritization of economic growth
  over health.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural barriers to health policy implementation that
    operate at the governance level. The multi-centric nature of policymaking creates systematic challenges
    for translating public health objectives into local action. This is not about individual actor failures
    but about how policy structures distribute power and create implementation gaps. The finding that
    local boards prioritize economic growth over public health reflects broader structural tensions between
    commercial and health interests in alcohol policy.
