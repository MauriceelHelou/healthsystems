mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stay-at-home orders restrict movement and access to healthcare services'
- 'Step 2: Reduced access to pain management clinics and regular medical care'
- 'Step 3: Increased psychological distress from isolation and economic uncertainty'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with existing prescriptions may escalate use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 5: Non-medical use of prescription drugs increases during confinement period'

description: The study examined non-medical use of prescription drugs as an outcome measure during COVID-19
  stay-at-home orders. Mobility restriction was identified as a risk factor for this form of drug use,
  with mental health conditions and demographics serving as important covariates.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies policy-level intervention (stay-at-home orders) as a
    structural determinant of prescription drug misuse, avoiding individual blame. The structural root
    causes include both the pandemic response policy and the pre-existing healthcare system that creates
    conditions for prescription drug availability and inadequate pain management alternatives. Equity
    implications include differential access to telehealth, prescription monitoring programs, and mental
    health services during lockdown.
