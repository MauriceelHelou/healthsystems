direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Enhanced alcohol labels with health warnings are mandated through policy intervention'
- 'Step 2: Consumers who notice labels engage in reading the health information'
- 'Step 3: Reading leads to cognitive processing including thinking about the information'
- 'Step 4: Processing extends to social engagement through talking with others about labels'
- 'Step 5: Deeper engagement with health messaging increases knowledge retention and salience of alcohol
  harms'

description: Strengthening health messages on alcohol containers significantly increased label processing
  behaviors including reading labels, thinking about the information, and discussing labels with others.

  description: Study used three waves of surveys before and at two time-points after intervention, suggesting
    effects may accumulate with sustained exposure
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how structural policy interventions can facilitate
    informed decision-making by embedding health information into the commercial environment. Rather than
    requiring individuals to seek out information about alcohol harms, the policy brings this information
    to consumers at the point of consumption, reducing cognitive burden and information barriers.
