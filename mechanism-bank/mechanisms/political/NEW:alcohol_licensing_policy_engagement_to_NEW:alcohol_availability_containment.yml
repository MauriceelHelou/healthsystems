  health harms'

  frameworks'
- 'Step 4: Policy changes can contain (though not reduce) alcohol availability through licensing conditions

description: 'This qualitative study examined how public health teams in England and Scotland engage with
  alcohol licensing systems. Three main approaches emerged: (1) ''Challenging'' - focused on reducing
  availability and culture change, citing international evidence on availability-harm links; (2) ''Supportive''
  - passive approach supplying data on request, focused on safe/responsible retailing; (3) ''Collaborative''
  - close partnership with licensing teams. The study found that public health teams often adapted their
  approaches in ways that diminished focus on public health goals, raising questions about whether current
  licensing systems enable achievement of public health objectives.'

spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Study found differences between England (n=14 areas) and Scotland (n=6 areas) in public
    health approaches. All Scottish stakeholders took a 'challenging' approach while English approaches
    varied more widely across challenging, supportive, and collaborative types.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This study exemplifies structural competency by examining how policy systems (alcohol
    licensing) constrain or enable public health action. It identifies structural barriers: existing licensing
    systems cannot reduce alcohol availability, only contain it, because existing businesses cannot be
    closed on availability grounds. The study appropriately locates the problem in policy structures rather
    than individual behaviors, noting that public health effectiveness is limited by the constraints of
    current licensing systems. The finding that public health teams adapt (and sometimes compromise) their
    approaches highlights how structural constraints shape institutional behavior.'
