direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy limits hours during which alcohol can be sold at retail outlets'
- 'Step 2: Physical availability of alcohol reduced during restricted hours'
- 'Step 3: Opportunity for impulse purchases and consumption decreased'
- 'Step 4: Overall population alcohol consumption reduced including among women of childbearing age'
- 'Step 5: Prenatal alcohol exposure rates decrease, reducing risk of FASD'

  description: Areas with high baseline alcohol outlet density may see greater effects from hours restrictions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Hours restrictions represent a structural intervention that shapes the alcohol
    environment for entire populations rather than requiring individual-level behavior change. This approach
    acknowledges that harmful drinking patterns are produced by environmental factors including commercial
    availability.
