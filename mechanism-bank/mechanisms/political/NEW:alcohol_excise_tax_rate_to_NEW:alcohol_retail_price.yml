mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government increases excise taxes on alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, spirits)'
- 'Step 2: Producers and retailers incorporate tax increases into product pricing through pass-through
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Pass-through rates vary by market structure - overshifting occurs in imperfectly competitive
  markets where producers add markup beyond tax amount'
- 'Step 4: Consumer-facing prices increase, with beer taxes showing evidence of overshifting (>100% pass-through)
  and wine/spirits showing full shifting (~100% pass-through)'

description: This meta-analysis of 30 empirical studies examines how alcohol excise taxes translate into
  retail prices. The pass-through rate (the degree to which taxes are reflected in consumer prices) is
  critical for understanding alcohol tax policy effectiveness. Weighted averages show beer taxes are overshifted
  while wine-spirits taxes are fully shifted, though publication bias corrections suggest full shifting
  cannot be rejected for any beverage category.

  variation_notes: The review provides insights for data coverage by country, indicating geographic variation
    in pass-through rates across different national contexts and regulatory environments

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism is fundamentally structural - it examines how fiscal policy (taxation)
    operates through market structures to affect consumer-facing prices. The finding that market competition
    structure influences pass-through rates highlights how economic systems mediate policy effects. This
    has equity implications: in less competitive markets, consumers bear costs exceeding the tax amount
    (overshifting), which disproportionately affects lower-income populations who spend larger proportions
    of income on consumption goods. Understanding pass-through rates is essential for designing effective
    alcohol control policies that reduce consumption-related harms while considering economic justice.'
