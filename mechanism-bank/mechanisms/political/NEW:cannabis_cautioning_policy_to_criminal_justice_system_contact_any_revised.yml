mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis cautioning policies divert minor cannabis offenders from arrest to education/treatment'
- 'Step 2: Reduced formal criminal justice processing avoids creation of criminal records'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of court involvement and associated penalties'
- 'Step 4: Reduced collateral consequences of criminal conviction (employment barriers, housing discrimination)'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how drug policy choices at the structural level determine
    whether individuals experience criminalization versus diversion. The policy approach avoids treating
    drug use primarily as a criminal matter, reducing the cascade of harms from criminal records. This
    has equity implications as drug enforcement historically disproportionately affects marginalized communities.
