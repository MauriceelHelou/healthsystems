mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative impact zone policies restrict temporal and spatial alcohol availability'
- 'Step 2: Reduced outlet density and operating hours limit opportunities for public alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol availability decreases public intoxication and associated antisocial behavior'
- 'Step 4: Public order offense rates decline as alcohol-related public nuisance decreases'

description: Licensing policies aimed at restricting spatial and temporal alcohol availability were associated
  with faster declines in public order offenses. Areas with intense policies saw declines of approximately
  1.7 per 1000 population compared to 1.0 per 1000 in passive policy areas during 2009-2013.

    with higher alcohol problems at baseline
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how regulatory policy can address public disorder through
    environmental change rather than increased policing or criminalization of individuals. By modifying
    the alcohol environment, the policy addresses root causes of antisocial behavior while avoiding punitive
    approaches that disproportionately affect marginalized populations who may use public spaces for drinking.
