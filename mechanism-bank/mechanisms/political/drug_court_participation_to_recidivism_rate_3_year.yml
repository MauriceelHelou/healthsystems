- 'Step 1: Juvenile drug treatment courts (JDTCs) enroll youth with substance use issues into structured
  court supervision programs'
- 'Step 2: During court supervision, participants receive monitoring, treatment services, and judicial
  oversight'
- 'Step 3: Active supervision reduces opportunity and incentive for reoffending during the program period'
- 'Step 4: General recidivism decreases during court supervision compared to traditional juvenile adjudication'

description: Juvenile drug treatment courts show modest beneficial effects on general recidivism during
  court supervision (OR=1.38, 95% CI [1.03, 1.84]), but these effects do not persist after program completion.
  The overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Implementation quality and matching treatment
  to youth needs appear critical for effectiveness.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses how the criminal justice system's structural response
    to youth substance use affects recidivism outcomes. JDTCs represent an alternative to punitive approaches,
    attempting to address underlying substance use issues. However, the lack of sustained effects post-program
    suggests structural limitations in how these courts connect youth to ongoing community supports. Equity
    implications include concerns about whether all youth have equal access to high-quality JDTC programs
    and whether implementation failures disproportionately affect certain communities.
