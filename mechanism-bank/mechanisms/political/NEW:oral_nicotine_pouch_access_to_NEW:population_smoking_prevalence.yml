mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ONP products enter market and become commercially available (since 2016 globally)'
- 'Step 2: Population-level exposure to alternative nicotine products increases'
- 'Step 3: Potential substitution effects at population level'
- 'Step 4: Theoretical impact on combustible tobacco prevalence (direction uncertain)'

description: No evidence exists on the population-level effects of ONP availability on smoking prevalence
  - this represents a critical evidence gap for tobacco control policy
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: ONP emerged in late 2000s but gained global market presence since 2016; regulatory
    environments vary by jurisdiction affecting availability and marketing
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The absence of population-level evidence is itself structurally significant. Regulatory
    decisions about novel nicotine products are being made without understanding of population health
    impacts. This gap may differentially affect communities with different regulatory environments, marketing
    exposures, and access to cessation resources. Industry claims of harm reduction potential remain unsubstantiated
    at the population level.
