mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public health interventions (e.g., taxation, availability restrictions,
  marketing bans) reduce population-level alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Reduced consumption decreases incidence and prevalence of alcohol-attributable
  diseases including cirrhosis, cancers, cardiovascular disease, and injuries'
- 'Step 3: Mathematical models estimate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions
  by projecting changes in disease burden metrics (deaths, DALYs, QALYs)'
- 'Step 4: Cost-effective interventions can be prioritized for implementation to maximize
  population health gains'
