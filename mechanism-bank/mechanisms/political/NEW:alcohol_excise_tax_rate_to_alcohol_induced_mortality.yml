direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol excise tax increases implemented as public health policy'
- 'Step 2: Tax increases pass through to retail prices (full shifting for wine/spirits, overshifting for
  beer)'
- 'Step 3: Higher prices reduce per capita alcohol consumption through demand elasticity'
- 'Step 4: Reduced consumption decreases cumulative alcohol exposure and related organ damage'
- 'Step 5: Population-level reduction in alcohol-induced mortality including liver disease, alcohol poisoning,
  and alcohol-attributable cancers'

description: This comprehensive mechanism traces the causal pathway from alcohol taxation policy through
  market pass-through mechanisms to population health outcomes. The meta-analysis finding that taxes are
  fully or over-shifted to prices is critical for understanding policy effectiveness in reducing alcohol-related
  mortality.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention - using fiscal policy to modify
    the economic environment in which alcohol consumption decisions occur. It addresses root causes of
    alcohol-related mortality rather than targeting individual drinkers. The policy approach has equity
    implications: while taxes are regressive in absolute terms, the health benefits may be progressive
    if lower-income populations experience greater consumption reductions and consequently greater mortality
    reductions. Policy design should consider minimum unit pricing as a complement to taxation to enhance
    equity.'
