mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Warning label policies create mandatory information environment that modifies
  commercial alcohol presentation'
- 'Step 2: Labels increase salience of health risks at critical decision-making moments
  (purchase and consumption)'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced risk awareness and specific health messaging influence intentions
  to reduce or avoid alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Among receptive populations (e.g., pregnant persons, those concerned about
  specific health risks), labels contribute to behavior change including reduced consumption'
