mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy mandates require alcohol warning labels to be displayed on alcohol
  products at point of sale and consumption'
- 'Step 2: Consumers are exposed to warning messages about alcohol-related health
  risks through repeated product encounters'
- 'Step 3: Exposure increases population-level awareness and knowledge of alcohol-related
  health risks'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced knowledge creates foundation for informed decision-making about
  alcohol consumption'
