mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tax increases raise alcohol prices uniformly across income groups'
- 'Step 2: Price increases represent a larger proportion of discretionary income for
  low-income individuals'
- 'Step 3: Low-income consumers exhibit greater price elasticity due to tighter budget
  constraints'
- 'Step 4: Higher price sensitivity leads to greater consumption reductions among
  low-income alcohol users compared to higher-income groups'
