mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy increases taxation on alcoholic beverages, reducing affordability'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices at point of sale create economic barriers to purchasing alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Population-level purchasing behavior shifts toward reduced alcohol acquisition'
- 'Step 4: Aggregate adult alcohol per capita consumption decreases'

description: Taxation increases that reduce alcohol affordability were associated with an average reduction
  of 0.83 litres of pure alcohol per capita per year in the same year across four northeastern European
  Union countries. This represents a WHO 'best buy' alcohol control policy that worked as postulated.

  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how fiscal policy operates at the population level
    to reduce alcohol consumption without targeting individual behavior. The structural intervention (taxation)
    modifies the economic environment, making alcohol less accessible regardless of individual choices.
    This approach avoids individual blame by addressing upstream determinants of consumption patterns.
