direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing (MUP) establishes a legally required floor price per
  unit of alcohol, increasing the cost of cheap, high-strength alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Price increases disproportionately affect heavy drinkers who typically
  consume low-cost, high-alcohol products, reducing their overall alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption leads to decreased acute alcohol-related health
  events (e.g., intoxication, injuries) with immediate effects on hospital admissions'
- 'Step 4: Over 2-3 years, reduced chronic alcohol consumption decreases the incidence
  and progression of alcohol-related diseases (e.g., liver disease)'
- 'Step 5: Both acute and chronic reductions result in fewer alcohol-related hospital
  admissions, with acute admissions reducing by 2-9% immediately and chronic admissions
  reducing by 4-9% after a lag period'

description: Minimum unit pricing for alcohol reduces alcohol-related hospitalizations
  by establishing a price floor that increases costs of cheap, high-strength alcohol
  products. This systematic review of 22 studies (6 natural experiments and 16 modelling
  studies) found a moderate-to-strong causal link using Bradford Hill Criteria. Real-world
  studies showed immediate 2-9% reductions in acute alcohol-related admissions and
  4-9% annual reductions in chronic admissions after a 2-3 year lag. Modelling studies
  estimated 3-10% annual reductions in alcohol-related admissions.
