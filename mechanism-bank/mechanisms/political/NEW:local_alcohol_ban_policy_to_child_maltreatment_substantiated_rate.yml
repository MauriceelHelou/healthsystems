direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Comprehensive area-level alcohol bans eliminate or severely restrict alcohol availability in
  local government areas'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability decreases population-level alcohol consumption, particularly heavy
  episodic drinking'
- 'Step 3: Lower parental/caregiver alcohol use reduces alcohol-impaired parenting and associated neglect
  behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Decreased alcohol-related family dysfunction leads to reduced child maltreatment incidents'
- 'Step 5: Fewer substantiated child abuse and neglect cases at the community level'

description: Comprehensive area-level alcohol bans predict a 38.5% reduction in substantiated child maltreatment
  cases. This represents a structural intervention that modifies the community alcohol environment rather
  than targeting individual behavior, demonstrating how policy can reduce child harm by addressing upstream
  determinants.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism exemplifies structural intervention - rather than blaming individual
    parents for alcohol misuse, it identifies how community-level alcohol policy can protect children.
    The policy operates at the population level, reducing environmental exposure to alcohol availability
    that disproportionately affects vulnerable families. Equity implications: Communities with comprehensive
    bans, often implemented in response to alcohol-related harms, may see protective effects for children
    in at-risk families who otherwise face concentrated disadvantage.'
