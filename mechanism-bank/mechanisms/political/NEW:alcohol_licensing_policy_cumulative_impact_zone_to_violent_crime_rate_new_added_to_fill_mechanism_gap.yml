mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local government implements cumulative impact zones and enhanced licensing enforcement'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol outlet density decreases clustering of drinking establishments'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol availability reduces intoxication levels in public spaces'
- 'Step 4: Decreased intoxication reduces alcohol-fueled interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 5: Violent crimes and assaults decline in affected areas'

description: Local alcohol licensing policies were associated with a 4.6% reduction in violent crimes,
  especially in the period up to 2013. The credible interval crosses zero, indicating uncertainty, but
  the point estimate suggests a meaningful public safety benefit from alcohol environment modification.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism connects alcohol policy to community safety outcomes, demonstrating
    how regulatory interventions can reduce violence without relying on criminal justice responses. The
    reduction in violent crime represents a structural approach to public safety that addresses environmental
    conditions rather than individual perpetrators. Areas with high alcohol outlet density often experience
    elevated violence rates, so this policy may have equity implications for disadvantaged neighborhoods.
