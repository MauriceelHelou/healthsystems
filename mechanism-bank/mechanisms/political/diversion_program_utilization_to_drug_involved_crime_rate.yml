description: The review examined whether diversion programs reduce offending behavior among class A drug
  users, as drug-related crime accounts for nearly 90% of the £15B societal costs of problematic drug
  use in England and Wales. While offending was a main outcome, specific effect sizes for crime reduction
  were not extractable from the meta-analysis.

  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Societal costs of drug-related crime exceed £15B in England and Wales, representing
    90% of total costs. US evidence may not generalize to UK criminal justice context.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how structural responses to drug use (treatment vs punishment)
    can interrupt the cycle linking poverty, addiction, and crime. The massive societal cost of drug-related
    crime (£15B) reflects systemic failures in addressing substance use as a health condition rather than
    a criminal matter. Diversion programs represent policy-level recognition that incarceration perpetuates
    rather than addresses the structural conditions driving drug-related offending.
