mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased alcohol taxation raises the price of alcoholic beverages, creating
  economic barriers to alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices reduce alcohol availability and accessibility, particularly
  affecting price-sensitive populations and heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption and accessibility leads to decreased development
  and progression of alcohol use disorder'

description: Alcohol taxation reduces alcohol use disorder through economic mechanisms
  that decrease accessibility and consumption. Higher taxes make alcohol less affordable,
  particularly affecting price-sensitive populations and heavy drinkers. This price-based
  intervention is identified as one of the most cost-effective strategies for reducing
  alcohol-related harm, with evidence from multiple countries showing effectiveness
  in reducing alcohol-attributable diseases, though effects may vary by specific disorder
  type and population characteristics.
structural_competency_notes: Alcohol taxation represents a structural intervention
  that addresses the social determinants of alcohol use disorder by modifying the
  economic environment. The policy disproportionately affects lower-income populations
  who are more price-sensitive, potentially reducing health disparities. However,
  implementation requires political will and must navigate industry opposition, highlighting
  the intersection of public health policy with economic and political power structures.
