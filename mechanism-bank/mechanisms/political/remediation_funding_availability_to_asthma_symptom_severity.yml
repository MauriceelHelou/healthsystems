- 'Step 1: Public funding enables systematic housing remediation interventions (mold removal, ventilation
  improvement)'
- 'Step 2: Professional remediation addresses structural sources of environmental triggers'
- 'Step 3: Elimination of mold and improved ventilation reduces indoor air contaminants'
- 'Step 4: Decreased exposure to respiratory triggers reduces bronchial inflammation and hyperresponsiveness'
- 'Step 5: Measurable reduction in asthma symptom severity and frequency'

description: Public investment in housing remediation funding creates direct improvements in children's
  asthma outcomes by addressing structural environmental triggers at their source.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Remediation funding represents a structural intervention that addresses root causes
    rather than treating downstream symptoms. The need for public funding highlights how market failures
    leave low-income families unable to afford necessary housing improvements, requiring policy intervention
    to achieve health equity.
