direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy mandates installation of ignition interlock devices that prevent
  vehicle operation when alcohol is detected on driver''s breath'
- 'Step 2: Device creates a physical barrier to impaired driving by disabling vehicle
  ignition when blood alcohol exceeds threshold'
- 'Step 3: Continuous enforcement of abstinence while driving eliminates opportunities
  for repeat DWI offenses'
- 'Step 4: Recidivism rates decrease substantially during the period of device installation
  and monitoring'
