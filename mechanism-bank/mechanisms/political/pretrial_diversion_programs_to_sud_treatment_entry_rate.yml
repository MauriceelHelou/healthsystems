- 'Step 1: Expansion of diversionary programs provides alternatives to incarceration for individuals with
  substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Diversion routes individuals away from traditional criminal justice processing toward treatment
  services'
- 'Step 3: Increased referral pathways from probation/parole and diversionary programs to specialty SUD
  treatment facilities'
- 'Step 4: Greater access to evidence-based treatment for substance use disorders'

description: The proportion of referrals to specialty SUD treatment from probation/parole and diversionary
  programs increased significantly from 2015-2019 (p<0.001), even as overall legal system referrals declined.
  This suggests policy shifts toward diversion are creating new pathways to treatment.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural changes in criminal justice policy that shift
    from punitive approaches toward treatment-based interventions. The decline in overall legal referrals
    may reflect broader decriminalization efforts, while growth in diversion programs represents a more
    health-centered approach to substance use. This structural shift has equity implications as criminal
    justice involvement disproportionately affects marginalized communities.
