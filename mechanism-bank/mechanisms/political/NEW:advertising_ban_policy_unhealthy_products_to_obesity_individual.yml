direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ban on advertising unhealthy food products reduces exposure to marketing of obesogenic foods'
- 'Step 2: Decreased marketing exposure reduces consumer demand for highly processed, calorie-dense foods'
- 'Step 3: Reduced consumption of unhealthy foods leads to improved dietary patterns at population level'
- 'Step 4: Lower caloric intake from marketed unhealthy products contributes to reduced obesity prevalence'

  equity_implications: This mechanism targets the food environment and commercial determinants rather
    than individual dietary choices. Recognizes that food industry marketing practices create obesogenic
    environments, particularly affecting vulnerable populations with less resources to resist marketing
    pressure. Policy intervention addresses root structural cause.
