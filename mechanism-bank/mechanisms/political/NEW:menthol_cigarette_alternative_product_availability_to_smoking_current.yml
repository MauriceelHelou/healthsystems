mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco industry introduces menthol alternatives (filter capsules, sprays, cards, tips, synthetic
  coolant cigarettes) to market'
- 'Step 2: Adults who smoke menthol cigarettes become aware of these alternative products (66.4% aware
  of at least one menthol accessory)'
- 'Step 3: When menthol cigarette sales are restricted, smokers substitute with alternative products (80.2%
  report substitution intentions for accessories)'
- 'Step 4: Continued nicotine delivery through alternative menthol products maintains smoking behavior
  and undermines public health benefit of menthol restrictions'

description: Tobacco industry introduction of menthol cigarette alternative products (accessories and
  synthetic coolant cigarettes) creates market substitution pathways that may undermine public health
  benefits of menthol cigarette restrictions. High awareness (66.4% accessories, 39.6% cooling cigarettes),
  substantial ever use (41.4% accessories, 25.9% cooling cigarettes), and strong substitution intentions
  (80.2% accessories, 56.0% cooling cigarettes) demonstrate potential policy circumvention.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism traces to structural factors: tobacco industry marketing strategies,
    regulatory gaps that allow alternative products, and incomplete menthol restriction policies. The
    disproportionate marketing of menthol cigarettes to Black communities (50.9% of sample was Black)
    creates racialized health inequities. Policy solutions require comprehensive restrictions covering
    all menthol-delivering products, not individual behavior change.'
