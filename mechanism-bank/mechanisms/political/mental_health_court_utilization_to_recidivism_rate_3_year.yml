description: This meta-analysis of 15 studies demonstrates that Mental Health Court participation is associated
  with a 42.46% reduction in recidivism compared to traditional criminal justice processing. MHCs represent
  a structural intervention that diverts individuals with mental illness from incarceration into community-based
  treatment, addressing the root cause of criminal behavior (untreated mental illness) rather than simply
  punishing the behavior.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism exemplifies structural competency by recognizing that criminal behavior
    among individuals with mental illness often stems from inadequate access to mental health treatment
    rather than individual moral failing. MHCs represent a policy-level intervention that restructures
    the criminal justice response to mental illness, replacing punitive approaches with therapeutic ones.
    The intervention addresses systemic failures in the mental health system that leave individuals without
    appropriate care. This approach aligns with balanced justice principles and reduces the criminalization
    of mental illness. Equity implications include the need to ensure MHCs are accessible across jurisdictions
    and demographics, as rural and low-income communities may have less access to such diversion programs.
