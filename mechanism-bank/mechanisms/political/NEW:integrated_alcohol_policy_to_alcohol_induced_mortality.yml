mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of integrated alcohol policies reduces population-level alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Decreased per capita consumption leads to reduced heavy drinking occasions and chronic heavy
  drinking'
- 'Step 3: Lower population alcohol consumption reduces alcohol-related disease burden (liver disease,
  cardiovascular effects, cancers)'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-induced mortality decreases as a downstream consequence of reduced consumption'

description: Integrated alcohol policies that successfully reduce population-level alcohol consumption
  are expected to reduce alcohol-induced mortality through the well-established dose-response relationship
  between alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable deaths. The nearly 1 litre reduction in per capita
  consumption represents a substantial public health impact.

  strength: moderate
  description: The study examined unrecorded consumption trends as a potential confounder - policy effects
    on recorded consumption could be offset by shifts to unrecorded alcohol
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This pathway demonstrates how structural policy interventions operate through population-level
    mechanisms rather than individual behavior change. The policy framework modified the commercial and
    regulatory environment around alcohol, affecting entire population exposure levels. This approach
    recognizes that alcohol-related harm is shaped by structural factors including pricing, availability,
    marketing, and regulatory frameworks - not solely by individual choices. Equity implications include
    potential differential effects across socioeconomic groups, as alcohol policies may have greater proportional
    impact on price-sensitive populations.
