description: Legal system referrals represent a significant pathway to SUD treatment, though the proportion
  of overall legal referrals declined from 2015-2019 (p<0.001). The changing composition of legal referrals
  reflects evolving policy approaches to substance use.

  equity_implications: While criminal justice contact can serve as a gateway to treatment, it also reflects
    structural inequities in who is policed and prosecuted. The overall decline in legal referrals may
    indicate policy shifts toward less punitive approaches. However, reliance on criminal justice for
    treatment access highlights gaps in voluntary treatment accessibility.
