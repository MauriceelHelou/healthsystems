structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how commercial actors use financial relationships to capture
    or neutralize potential opposition. The structural underfunding of public health creates vulnerability
    to industry influence. Addressing this mechanism requires systemic solutions including adequate public
    health funding and clear firewalls between industry and health organizations. The burden of alcohol
    harm falls disproportionately on lower-income communities who have less political power to resist
    industry influence.
