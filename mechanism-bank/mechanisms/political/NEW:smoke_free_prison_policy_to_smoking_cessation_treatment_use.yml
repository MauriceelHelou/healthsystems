description: The proliferation of smoke-free prison policies internationally creates an opportunity for
  smoking cessation interventions. However, without coordinated treatment and support systems, these policies
  alone do not produce sustained abstinence following release.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: International proliferation of smoke-free policies noted, but evidence base is almost
    exclusively US-based
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how policy interventions (smoke-free prisons) can create
    windows of opportunity for health improvement, but must be accompanied by comprehensive support systems
    to achieve lasting benefit. The focus on extending benefits 'into the community' reflects understanding
    that health outcomes are shaped by conditions across life course and institutional settings. This
    is particularly relevant for health equity given that correctional populations are drawn disproportionately
    from communities already experiencing health disparities.
