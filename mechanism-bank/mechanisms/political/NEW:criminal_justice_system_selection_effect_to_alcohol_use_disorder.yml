direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice policies and enforcement practices target behaviors associated with substance
  use (public intoxication, property crime, drug possession)'
- 'Step 2: Communities with limited economic resources and social services have higher rates of both substance
  use disorders and criminal justice contact'
- 'Step 3: Absence of pretrial diversion and treatment alternatives results in incarceration rather than
  treatment for individuals with AUD'
- 'Step 4: Prison reception populations show highly elevated AUD prevalence (24%) compared to general
  population due to this selection process'

description: The 24% pooled prevalence of AUD in newly incarcerated prisoners reflects a structural selection
  effect whereby criminal justice involvement concentrates individuals with substance use disorders. This
  is not simply individual pathology but a systems-level phenomenon where policy choices about enforcement
  and treatment determine who enters prison.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly frames high AUD prevalence as a structural phenomenon
    rather than individual failure. The concentration of AUD in prison populations reflects policy decisions
    about what behaviors to criminalize, where to deploy enforcement resources, and whether to invest
    in treatment alternatives. The finding that approximately 1 in 4 new prisoners has AUD indicts a system
    that criminalizes rather than treats addiction.
