description: The paper notes that excessive alcohol use contributes to domestic violence. By restricting
  alcohol availability through cumulative impact zones, licensing policies may reduce domestic violence
  through population-level reductions in alcohol consumption.

  variation_notes: Domestic violence mentioned in abstract as outcome of excessive alcohol use but specific
    results may require full-text
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Addressing domestic violence through alcohol availability restrictions represents
    a structural approach that complements victim services and perpetrator interventions. This recognizes
    alcohol as a facilitating factor in domestic violence while avoiding victim-blaming narratives.
