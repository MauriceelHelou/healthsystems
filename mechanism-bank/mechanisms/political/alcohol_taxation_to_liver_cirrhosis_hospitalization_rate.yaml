mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol taxation increases the price of alcoholic beverages, making them
  less affordable and reducing population-level alcohol consumption through economic
  deterrence'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases chronic alcohol exposure and alcohol-related
  liver damage, preventing progression from alcoholic liver disease to advanced liver
  cirrhosis'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of liver cirrhosis development and progression result in fewer
  severe cases requiring hospitalization for cirrhosis-related complications'

description: Alcohol taxation policies create economic barriers to alcohol consumption,
  leading to population-level reductions in alcohol use. This decreased consumption
  reduces chronic alcohol exposure and associated liver damage, ultimately resulting
  in lower rates of liver cirrhosis development and fewer hospitalizations for cirrhosis-related
  complications. Evidence from Lithuania shows that taxation policies in 2008 and
  2017 were associated with significant reductions in liver cirrhosis outcomes, with
  effects varying across age groups.
structural_competency_notes: Taxation represents a structural policy intervention
  that addresses alcohol-related health disparities by reducing consumption across
  populations. However, effects may vary by socioeconomic status, as taxation may
  have differential impacts on alcohol purchasing behavior across income levels, potentially
  affecting vulnerable populations differently.
