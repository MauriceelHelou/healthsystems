category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Police deploy sobriety checkpoints at strategic roadway locations within a geographic area'
- 'Step 2: Checkpoint presence creates both actual apprehension risk and perceived deterrence through
  visibility'
- 'Step 3: Drivers modify behavior to avoid detection, reducing alcohol-impaired driving in the immediate
  area'
- 'Step 4: Deterrent effect decays spatially beyond ~3,000 roadway kilometers and temporally beyond ~1
  week'
- 'Step 5: Lower rates of breath tests detecting BAC ≥0.05% indicate reduced alcohol-impaired driving'

description: 'One additional sobriety checkpoint conducted per 500 roadway kilometers was associated with
  a 2.5% reduction in BAC≥0.05% breath tests within local SA2 units (IRR=0.975, 95% CrI: 0.973-0.978)
  and 5.5% reduction within SA3 units (IRR=0.945, 95% CrI: 0.937-0.953). This deterrent effect is spatially
  and temporally bounded, decaying beyond local areas of ~60,000 residents/3,000 roadway km and after
  ~1 week.'

  variation_notes: Effects are geographically bounded - strongest within local SA2 units (mean pop ~8,883,
    ~469 roadway km) and SA3 units (mean pop ~57,202, ~2,936 roadway km). Effects attenuate toward null
    in spatially adjacent units and beyond areas containing approximately 60,000 residents and 3,000 kilometers
    of roadway.

- name: geographic_unit_size
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Larger geographic units (SA3 vs SA2) show stronger effects - 5.5% reduction at SA3 level
    vs 2.5% at SA2 level per checkpoint, likely due to better capture of spillover effects
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how law enforcement resource allocation and deployment
    strategies serve as structural interventions affecting population-level health behaviors. The spatial
    decay of effects suggests that equitable distribution of enforcement resources across geographic areas
    is critical - areas with less checkpoint activity may have systematically higher alcohol-impaired
    driving rates. This has equity implications for communities that may be over- or under-policed. The
    finding also demonstrates that sustained, geographically distributed intervention is needed rather
    than concentrated, sporadic enforcement.
