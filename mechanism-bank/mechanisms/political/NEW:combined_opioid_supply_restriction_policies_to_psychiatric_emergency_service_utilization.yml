description: Differences between opioid and control groups in mental health-related ED presentations and
  hospital admissions were not statistically significant. This suggests opioid restriction policies can
  be implemented without causing long-term increases in mental health crises.

  equity_implications: This finding addresses concerns about unintended consequences of supply-restriction
    policies on mental health. The lack of increased mental health presentations suggests that structural
    interventions can reduce opioid-related harm without exacerbating psychiatric burden. However, equity
    considerations require monitoring whether specific subpopulations (e.g., those with chronic pain,
    those lacking access to alternative treatments) may be differentially affected.
