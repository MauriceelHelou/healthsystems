direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government implements total or partial ban on alcohol marketing/advertising'
- 'Step 2: Reduced exposure to alcohol promotional messages in media, public spaces, and retail environments'
- 'Step 3: Decreased normalization of alcohol consumption and reduced cues triggering drinking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Expected reduction in population-level alcohol consumption'

description: This systematic review examined whether alcohol marketing bans reduce alcohol consumption,
  a policy declared a 'best buy' by WHO. Of 11 studies identified, 6 reported null findings (no effect
  on consumption). Studies finding reduced consumption had moderate to critical risk of bias, while 2
  studies with low/moderate bias actually found increased consumption post-ban. The review concluded insufficient
  evidence to support the claim that alcohol marketing bans constitute a best buy for reducing consumption.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Studies examined marketing restrictions across diverse locations including New Zealand,
    Thailand, Canadian provinces, Spain, Norway, and multi-country analyses of 17-45 locations (mostly
    high-income European and North American countries). Results varied substantially by location.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism represents a structural/policy-level intervention targeting the
    commercial determinants of health rather than individual behavior change. Marketing bans aim to modify
    the information environment that shapes population drinking patterns. The null/mixed findings raise
    important questions about the effectiveness of this upstream policy approach, though methodological
    limitations (confounding, selection bias, information bias, reporting bias) may explain inconsistent
    results. The structural approach is appropriate as it targets corporate marketing practices rather
    than individual consumer choices. Equity implications are unclear from this evidence, though marketing
    often disproportionately targets vulnerable populations.
