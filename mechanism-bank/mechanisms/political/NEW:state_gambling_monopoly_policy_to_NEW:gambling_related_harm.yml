mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State monopoly consolidates gambling operations under single government-controlled entity'
- 'Step 2: Monopoly structure creates intertwined stakeholder interests between government revenue needs
  and harm prevention'
- 'Step 3: Consensus politics amplifies support for monopoly maintenance over liberalization'
- 'Step 4: Monopoly framing emphasizes harm prevention justifications over market competition'
- 'Step 5: Regulatory control theoretically limits gambling availability and reduces population-level
  harms compared to competitive markets'

description: Finnish state gambling monopoly represents unique case where gambling monopoly was strengthened
  despite political and international pressures toward liberalization, contrasting with alcohol and rail
  sectors that were liberalized during same period. The study suggests intertwined stakeholder interests
  create consensus politics supporting monopoly maintenance.

  variation_notes: Finland maintains fully monopolistic gambling sector while most Western European countries
    have moved to license-based competition; Finnish context shows gambling monopoly strengthened while
    alcohol and rail monopolies were liberalized during same period

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism examines how political economy and stakeholder configurations shape
    gambling policy, tracing to structural determinants of gambling availability rather than individual
    gambling behaviors. The comparison across sectors reveals how different structural arrangements (monopoly
    vs. competition) emerge from varying political-economic conditions rather than inherent sector characteristics.
