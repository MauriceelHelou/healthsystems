description: Insurance prior authorization requirements for buprenorphine create structural barriers that
  waivered NPs/PAs identify as key obstacles to prescribing, limiting patient access to evidence-based
  OUD treatment
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 240
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Prior authorization represents a policy mechanism embedded in insurance structures
    that creates barriers to care. This is a structural determinant that affects treatment access regardless
    of individual provider or patient characteristics. Policy reform eliminating prior authorization for
    OUD medications addresses the root cause.
