  district'
- 'Step 3: Crime statistics monitored before and after legislative change'
- 'Step 4: Self-reported experiences of violence also assessed among patrons'
- 'Step 5: No change observed in crime statistics or self-reported violence experiences'

description: Despite the stated policy goal of reducing alcohol-related violence in youth, the trading
  hour restrictions showed no effect on crime statistics or self-reported experiences of violence. The
  legislation failed to achieve its primary public health objective while increasing intoxication levels
  through behavioral adaptation.

  variation_notes: Crime statistics from police records in Queensland entertainment districts. No significant
    change detected despite policy goal of violence reduction.

    effects were minimal
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This null finding is critically important for health equity. The policy intervention
    failed to address the structural roots of alcohol-related violence, instead focusing on supply restriction
    alone. The authors conclude that legislation not accounting for cultural patterns (preloading) and
    local conditions will be unsuccessful. This suggests need for multi-component interventions addressing
    social norms, venue management practices, and community-level factors rather than simple supply restrictions.
