mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Laws prohibiting alcohol sales to minors exist but are not properly enforced'
- 'Step 2: Commercial establishments operate open bar events without age verification'
- 'Step 3: Minors can easily access venues selling unlimited alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Lack of consequences for vendors perpetuates availability to youth'
- 'Step 5: Adolescents attend these events at high rates (17.1% in past year)'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This is a clear structural mechanism - the root cause is regulatory failure, not
    individual youth behavior. The paper explicitly calls for legislation to restrict alcohol promotions
    and advertising to be implemented and effectively monitored. Equity implications include differential
    enforcement patterns that may vary by neighborhood socioeconomic status.
