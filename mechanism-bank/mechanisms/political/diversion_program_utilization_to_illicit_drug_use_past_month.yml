description: Diversion programs that redirect class A drug-using offenders from the criminal justice system
  to treatment show potential small impact on reducing primary drug use. The odds ratio of 1.68 suggests
  diversion participants are 68% more likely to reduce primary drug use compared to non-diverted individuals,
  though evidence quality is limited.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism addresses structural factors by examining how criminal justice policy
    alternatives (diversion vs incarceration) affect health outcomes. Rather than blaming individuals
    for drug use, it examines how systemic responses to substance use can either perpetuate harm through
    incarceration or facilitate recovery through treatment access. The policy-level intervention recognizes
    that incarceration fails to address underlying health needs and may worsen outcomes.
