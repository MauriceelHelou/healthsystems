mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Section 64 alcohol restrictions implemented in Western Australia place conditions on liquor
  licenses limiting alcohol sales (e.g., off-premises trading hours) in specified communities'
- 'Step 2: Restrictions aim to reduce community-wide alcohol availability and associated harms'
- 'Step 3: Rather than deterring tourism, regions with restrictions showed tourism growth over time'
- 'Step 4: Evidence suggests restrictions may support sustainable tourism by reducing alcohol-related
  harms that could negatively impact visitor experience and community safety'

description: This exploratory study examined whether area-wide alcohol restrictions (Section 64) implemented
  in Western Australian communities negatively affected tourism. Time-series analysis found that regions
  with restrictions experienced tourism growth over time, and trip numbers for restricted versus non-restricted
  non-metropolitan regions were significantly cross-correlated (r=0.48, p=0.03). The study concludes that
  alcohol restrictions aimed at reducing harm do not appear to negatively affect tourism, challenging
  industry objections to such policies.

  variation_notes: Study examined tourism trends across different Western Australia tourism regions (metropolitan
    vs non-metropolitan, restricted vs non-restricted areas). North-West and Golden Outback regions were
    specifically noted as areas affected by restrictions. International trips contributed less than 20%
    of total trips.

  description: Non-metropolitan regions with restrictions showed cross-correlated tourism patterns with
    non-restricted regions, suggesting restrictions did not differentially harm tourism in restricted
    areas

  direction: weakens
  strength: weak
  description: Domestic trips were primary focus; international trips represented less than 20% of total
    and may respond differently to restrictions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism importantly addresses a common political argument against evidence-based
    alcohol policy - that restrictions will harm local economies through reduced tourism. The study demonstrates
    that structural interventions to reduce alcohol availability (a known driver of alcohol-related harms)
    need not conflict with economic development goals. This has equity implications as alcohol restrictions
    are often implemented in regional and Indigenous communities that face disproportionate alcohol-related
    harms. Objections based on tourism concerns may perpetuate health inequities by blocking protective
    policies in vulnerable communities.
