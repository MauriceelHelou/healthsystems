  and user fee requirements, fundamentally shape the availability and accessibility of interpretation
  services in healthcare settings.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism explicitly identifies policy as the root structural determinant
    of interpreter service access. Restrictive policies create systematic exclusion of immigrant populations
    from quality healthcare, representing a failure of equitable policy design rather than individual
    or cultural factors.
