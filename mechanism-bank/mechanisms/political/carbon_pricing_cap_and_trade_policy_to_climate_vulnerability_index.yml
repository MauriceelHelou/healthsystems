- 'Step 1: Carbon pricing policies reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5-21% in implemented jurisdictions'
- 'Step 2: Reduced emissions contribute to slowing the rate of climate change and extreme weather intensification'
- 'Step 3: Slower climate change progression reduces the frequency and severity of climate-related hazards'
- 'Step 4: Decreased climate hazard exposure reduces population-level climate vulnerability, particularly
  for marginalized communities'

description: Carbon pricing contributes to reducing climate vulnerability through documented emissions
  reductions. With over 70 carbon pricing schemes now implemented globally and demonstrated effectiveness
  in at least 17 of 21 evaluated schemes, this policy mechanism represents a proven structural approach
  to climate mitigation.

  description: Over 70 carbon pricing schemes globally means cumulative effects on climate are increasing
    with broader adoption
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Climate vulnerability is unequally distributed, with low-income communities, communities
    of color, elderly populations, and those with chronic health conditions facing greater risks from
    climate change. Structural policies that reduce emissions address root causes of climate-related health
    inequities. The paper notes critical evidence gaps regarding unevaluated carbon pricing schemes, suggesting
    need for continued policy evaluation.
