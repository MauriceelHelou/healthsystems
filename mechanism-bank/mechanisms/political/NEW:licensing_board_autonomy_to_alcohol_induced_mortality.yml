mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensing Boards act with autonomy from the rest of the alcohol policy implementation system'
- 'Step 2: Autonomous operation creates misalignment between licensing decisions and public health strategy'
- 'Step 3: Lack of coordination allows alcohol availability patterns that contradict harm reduction goals'
- 'Step 4: Continued alcohol-related harms and inequalities result from policy implementation failure'
- 'Step 5: Population-level alcohol-induced mortality persists despite legislative public health objectives'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how institutional fragmentation within governance systems
    produces health inequities. The structural arrangement that allows licensing bodies to operate independently
    of public health strategy represents a root cause of alcohol-related harm. Solutions require restructuring
    accountability relationships, not individual behavior change.
