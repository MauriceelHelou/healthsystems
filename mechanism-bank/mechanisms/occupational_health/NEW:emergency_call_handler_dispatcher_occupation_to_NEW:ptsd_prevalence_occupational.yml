direction: positive
category: occupational_health
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency call-handlers and dispatchers (CHDs) receive distressing emergency calls involving
  trauma, violence, and life-threatening situations'
- 'Step 2: Repeated vicarious exposure to traumatic content without direct involvement creates secondary
  traumatic stress'
- 'Step 3: Inability to control outcomes or provide direct assistance contributes to helplessness and
  moral distress'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative occupational stress exposure leads to development of PTSD symptoms'

description: Pooled prevalence of PTSD among emergency and urgent call-handlers and dispatchers is 17.8%,
  indicating significant occupational mental health risk from repeated exposure to traumatic calls without
  direct intervention capability.

  description: Variation across nine countries may reflect differences in work conditions, support systems,
    and healthcare access
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural occupational hazards rather than individual
    vulnerability. The work environment itself creates pathogenic conditions through chronic exposure
    to vicarious trauma. Interventions should focus on organizational support, staffing levels, and mandatory
    psychological support rather than individual resilience training.
