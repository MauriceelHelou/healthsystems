direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
  - 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption causes progressive hepatocellular injury through acetaldehyde toxicity and oxidative stress'
  - 'Step 2: Ongoing injury progresses through steatosis → alcoholic hepatitis → fibrosis → cirrhosis over 10-30 years'
  - 'Step 3: Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension, synthetic dysfunction, and hepatocellular carcinoma risk'
  - 'Step 4: Decompensation events (variceal bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome) become recurrent'
  - 'Step 5: End-stage liver disease results in death from hemorrhage, infection, hepatic encephalopathy, or liver failure'

  equity_implications: Liver disease mortality from alcohol reflects structural inequities at multiple levels. Individuals from marginalized communities face higher AUD prevalence due to historical trauma, economic marginalization, and targeted alcohol marketing. They also experience worse outcomes due to limited addiction treatment access, later diagnosis from lack of preventive care, and systematic exclusion from transplant waitlists through abstinence requirements that don't account for social determinants. High liver disease mortality in disadvantaged communities is a predictable outcome of policy choices around alcohol regulation, healthcare access, and social investment.
assumptions:
  - 'Assumes chronic heavy drinking (>3 drinks/day for women, >4 for men) sustained over decades'
  - 'Mortality pathway requires progression to advanced cirrhosis or HCC'
  - 'Does not account for competing mortality risks in populations with AUD'
limitations:
  - 'Individual genetic variation creates wide heterogeneity in progression speed'
  - 'Only 10-20% of chronic heavy drinkers develop cirrhosis'
  - 'Mechanism does not capture deaths in early disease stages from acute alcoholic hepatitis'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Liver disease mortality rates vary 4-fold across US counties, shaped by drinking patterns, healthcare infrastructure, and population demographics
  relevant_geographies:
    - 'Native American communities show 3-5x higher alcoholic cirrhosis mortality'
    - 'Appalachian region exhibits high rates related to economic distress and limited treatment'
    - 'Urban areas with transplant centers show lower mortality for insured patients'
