direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HIV diagnosis leads to activation of chronic immune response and systemic
  inflammation, with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) that
  can cross the blood-brain barrier'
- 'Step 2: Neuroinflammation affects neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonergic
  and dopaminergic pathways, contributing to mood dysregulation and depressive symptoms'
- 'Step 3: HIV can directly affect the central nervous system through viral proteins
  and HIV-associated neurocognitive changes, potentially affecting brain regions involved
  in emotional regulation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation and neurological changes, combined with the psychological
  burden of living with HIV, manifest as significantly elevated rates of suicidal
  ideation (40% prevalence in MSM living with HIV vs. 21% in general MSM population)'

description: HIV diagnosis is associated with substantially elevated suicidal ideation,
  with prevalence of 40% among MSM living with HIV compared to 21% in the general
  MSM population. The biological pathway involves chronic immune activation, neuroinflammation,
  and potential direct CNS effects of HIV, which dysregulate mood-related neurotransmitter
  systems and affect brain regions involved in emotional processing, culminating in
  increased suicidal ideation.
