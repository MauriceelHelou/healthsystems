direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use causes neuroadaptations in stress and reward circuits'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol withdrawal induces heightened stress reactivity and anxiety-like states'
- 'Step 3: Altered neurocircuitry increases vulnerability to developing PTSD following trauma exposure'
- 'Step 4: Bidirectional relationship established where AUD exacerbates PTSD symptoms and impairs recovery'

description: Alcohol use disorder can increase vulnerability to PTSD through neurobiological mechanisms,
  representing the bidirectional nature of this comorbidity. The review highlights how these conditions
  affect each other through shared nervous system nuclei.

  description: Dual diagnosis patients show poorer treatment outcomes than those with single diagnosis,
    suggesting comorbidity creates treatment resistance
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Access to trauma-informed addiction treatment remains structurally limited, particularly
    in under-resourced communities. The lack of integrated treatment models for comorbid PTSD-AUD represents
    a healthcare system failure that disproportionately affects marginalized populations. Structural barriers
    to treatment include lack of insurance coverage, shortage of trained providers, and geographic treatment
    deserts.
