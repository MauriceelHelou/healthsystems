mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care populations include individuals seeking healthcare, potentially
  enriched for those with risk factors'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol consumption in this population leads to progressive liver
  injury'
- 'Step 3: Among primary care patients, 1.7% have developed cirrhosis, intermediate
  between general population (0.3%) and AUD populations (12.9%)'
- 'Step 4: This intermediate prevalence reflects selection of healthcare-seeking individuals
  with elevated risk'
