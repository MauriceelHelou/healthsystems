- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol abuse leads to neuroadaptation in the central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol exposure causes downregulation of GABA receptors'

- 'Step 4: Unopposed excitatory neurotransmission leads to alcohol withdrawal syndrome'
- 'Step 5: Severe cases can progress to delirium tremens requiring ICU admission'

description: Chronic alcohol abuse leads to GABA receptor downregulation, which is a key biological mechanism
  underlying alcohol withdrawal syndrome and benzodiazepine resistance. This neuroadaptation explains
  why standard treatments may fail in severe cases.

  description: Longer duration and higher intensity of alcohol use leads to greater GABA receptor downregulation
    and more severe withdrawal
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Alcohol use disorder has clear structural determinants including alcohol outlet
    density, advertising exposure, economic stress, and lack of accessible treatment. The progression
    to severe withdrawal requiring ICU care often reflects structural failures in earlier intervention,
    including lack of access to outpatient detoxification services, substance use treatment deserts, and
    healthcare discrimination against people with AUD. The healthcare system burden is substantial - AWS
    significantly impacts healthcare spending and contributes to morbidity and mortality, disproportionately
    affecting communities with limited healthcare infrastructure.
