  node_name: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Prevalence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hurricane/storm exposure creates acute traumatic experiences including
  life-threatening situations, witnessing destruction, injury, or death of others,
  and loss of home/possessions'
- 'Step 2: These traumatic experiences trigger acute stress responses involving hyperactivation
  of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system'
- 'Step 3: In vulnerable individuals, the traumatic memories become consolidated in
  a maladaptive manner, leading to persistent re-experiencing symptoms, avoidance
  behaviors, negative alterations in cognition/mood, and hyperarousal'
- 'Step 4: Post-disaster stressors (displacement, resource loss, community disruption)
  prolong and compound initial trauma, increasing risk of chronic PTSD development'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 71 studies found consistently
  elevated risks of PTSD following cyclone/hurricane exposure. Mental disorders, especially
  PTSD, were among the health outcomes most frequently studied and showed robust positive
  associations with cyclone exposure. The evidence was particularly strong for high-amplitude
  cyclones such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.
