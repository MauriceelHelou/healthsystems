direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workers are exposed to vinyl chloride monomer through inhalation in occupational
  settings such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing plants'
- 'Step 2: Vinyl chloride is metabolized in the liver to reactive intermediates (chloroethylene
  oxide and chloroacetaldehyde) that cause hepatotoxic damage'
- 'Step 3: Chronic hepatotoxicity leads to progressive liver fibrosis and hepatic
  stellate cell activation'
- 'Step 4: Continued exposure results in development of cirrhosis, with potential
  multiplicative interaction with alcohol consumption accelerating disease progression'
- 'Step 5: Advanced cirrhosis leads to liver failure and increased mortality from
  liver disease'

description: Occupational exposure to vinyl chloride is associated with increased
  mortality from cirrhosis, based on evidence from large multicentre cohort studies.
  The European cohort study and a subcohort reported excess risk of cirrhosis mortality
  among vinyl chloride workers, though a meta-analysis did not confirm this excess.
  The relationship appears to be modified by alcohol consumption, with a multiplicative
  interaction effect. Pathology reports indicate that cirrhosis may develop after
  high exposures to vinyl chloride, though the evidence is more contested than for
  angiosarcoma (the hallmark vinyl chloride-related cancer).
