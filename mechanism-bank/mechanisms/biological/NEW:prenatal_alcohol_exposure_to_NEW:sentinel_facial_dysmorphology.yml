direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during critical periods of facial development (first trimester)'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol disrupts neural crest cell migration essential for craniofacial formation'
- 'Step 3: Teratogenic effects produce characteristic midface abnormalities'
- 'Step 4: Sentinel facial features (smooth philtrum, thin vermillion border, short palpebral fissures)
  develop'

  equity_implications: Facial dysmorphology serves as a diagnostic marker tracing to prenatal alcohol
    exposure, which itself is influenced by structural factors including alcohol availability, pricing
    policies, marketing, healthcare access, and social determinants. Diagnostic criteria based on this
    evidence can improve identification and intervention, but must be implemented equitably to avoid stigmatization.
