category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lichen sclerosus initiates chronic inflammation in genital skin and mucosal
  tissues'
- 'Step 2: Persistent inflammatory processes lead to progressive dermal changes including
  collagen deposition, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing inflammation causes atrophy, textural changes, and loss of normal
  tissue elasticity'
- 'Step 4: Structural alterations accumulate over time resulting in loss of normal
  genital architecture (14% of female cases, 34% of male cases presenting with architectural
  changes)'

description: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that leads to genital
  architectural changes through progressive tissue remodeling. The systematic review
  of 900 studies documented 17,011 clinical presentations in women and 5,745 in men,
  with loss of normal architecture representing a substantial proportion of presentations
  (14% in females, 34% in males). The pathological process involves chronic inflammation
  leading to atrophy, fibrosis, and permanent structural alterations of genital tissues.
