to_node:
  node_id: gamma_gt_elevated
  node_name: Gamma-GT Elevated
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol consumption in alcohol use disorder induces hepatic
  enzyme systems, particularly the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS)'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism generates toxic metabolites (acetaldehyde) and reactive
  oxygen species that cause hepatocellular damage and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Hepatocellular damage and enzyme induction lead to increased synthesis
  and release of gamma-glutamyl transferase from liver cells into circulation, resulting
  in elevated serum GGT levels'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase through
  chronic alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity and enzyme induction. Multiple studies consistently
  demonstrate that individuals with AUD have significantly elevated GGT levels compared
  to controls, and that GGT serves as both a marker of chronic alcohol consumption
  and liver damage. The relationship is dose-dependent and can improve with abstinence,
  indicating a direct causal pathway from alcohol exposure to GGT elevation.
structural_competency_notes: Access to healthcare for monitoring liver function may
  vary by socioeconomic status. Early detection and intervention programs targeting
  high-risk populations could prevent progression to severe liver disease. Cultural
  factors affecting alcohol consumption patterns and help-seeking behavior may influence
  the timeline and severity of GGT elevation.
