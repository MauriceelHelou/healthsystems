direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM2.5 particles which penetrate deep into the respiratory
  tract due to their small aerodynamic diameter (<2.5 μm)'
- 'Step 2: Deposition of particles in the bronchioles and alveoli triggers local inflammatory
  responses and oxidative stress in lung tissue'
- 'Step 3: Chronic or repeated exposure leads to airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary
  clearance, and exacerbation of existing respiratory conditions (COPD, asthma, pneumonia)'
- 'Step 4: Systemic inflammatory responses and compromised respiratory function increase
  susceptibility to respiratory infections and acute respiratory failure'
- 'Step 5: Progressive respiratory dysfunction and acute exacerbations lead to increased
  respiratory disease mortality'

description: PM2.5 exposure is consistently and independently associated with increased
  respiratory disease mortality across global populations. A 10 μg/m3 increase in
  PM2.5 is associated with approximately 0.68-0.74% increase in daily respiratory
  mortality in multi-city studies, with respiratory mortality effects generally stronger
  than cardiovascular effects in short-term exposure studies. The association persists
  after adjustment for gaseous pollutants (SO2, O3) in multi-pollutant models. Evidence
  from 652 cities across 24 countries demonstrates a consistent concentration-response
  relationship with no apparent safe threshold, supporting causal inference for the
  PM2.5-respiratory mortality relationship.
