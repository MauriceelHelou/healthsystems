description: The abstract explicitly identifies alcohol-associated liver disease as 'a common cause of
  morbidity and premature mortality,' establishing the pathway from ALD to early death. The high prevalence
  of ALD and cirrhosis in AUD populations represents a significant source of preventable mortality.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 513278
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Premature mortality from ALD reflects cumulative structural failures in alcohol
    policy (pricing, availability, marketing), healthcare access (screening, treatment for AUD), and social
    determinants that drive problematic alcohol use. The authors' conclusion that 'targeted interventions
    for liver disease such as case finding will be more effective in at-risk populations' points to structural
    healthcare system changes needed to prevent mortality.
