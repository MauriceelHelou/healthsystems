  node_id: low_birthweight_rate

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnant women in households using solid biomass fuels (wood, dung, crop
  residues, charcoal) for cooking are exposed to high levels of particulate matter
  (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, and other combustion byproducts'
- 'Step 2: Inhaled pollutants cross the placental barrier and/or induce systemic maternal
  inflammation and oxidative stress, reducing oxygen delivery to the fetus'
- 'Step 3: Chronic hypoxia, oxidative damage, and inflammatory responses impair placental
  function and fetal nutrient/oxygen transfer'
- 'Step 4: Restricted fetal growth results in increased risk of low birthweight (<2500g)
  at delivery'

description: 'Household air pollution from solid biomass fuel combustion exposes pregnant
  women to harmful particulate matter and gases that impair fetal development through
  mechanisms including maternal systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and reduced
  placental oxygen transfer. A meta-analysis of 4 intervention studies found that
  reducing HAP exposure through improved cookstoves significantly decreased the odds
  of low birthweight (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.61-0.87), confirming the causal pathway
  from HAP exposure to increased LBW risk.'
