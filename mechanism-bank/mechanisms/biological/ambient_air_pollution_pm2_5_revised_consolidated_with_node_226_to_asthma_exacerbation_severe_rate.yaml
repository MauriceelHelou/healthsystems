  node_name: Asthma Exacerbation Rate
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of airborne pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3) into the respiratory
  tract, with fine and ultrafine particles penetrating deep into the bronchial airways
  and alveoli'
- 'Step 2: Pollutants trigger oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades in airway
  epithelial cells, activating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) and
  recruiting inflammatory cells'
- 'Step 3: Airway inflammation leads to bronchial hyperresponsiveness, increased mucus
  production, and airway smooth muscle contraction'
- 'Step 4: In individuals with pre-existing asthma, this inflammatory response triggers
  acute bronchospasm and exacerbation of symptoms'
- 'Step 5: Severe exacerbations manifest as increased emergency department visits,
  hospitalizations, and need for systemic corticosteroid treatment'

description: Short-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants including PM2.5, PM10,
  NO2, and O3 increases the risk of asthma exacerbations through inflammatory and
  oxidative stress pathways in the airways. This systematic review for the EAACI guidelines
  synthesized evidence demonstrating that air pollution is one of the biggest environmental
  threats for asthma, with climate change augmenting its impact.
