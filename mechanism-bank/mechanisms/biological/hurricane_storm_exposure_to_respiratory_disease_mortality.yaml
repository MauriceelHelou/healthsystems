direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hurricane/storm exposure generates environmental hazards including flooding,
  structural damage, and disruption of infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Flooding and water damage promote mold growth and release of environmental
  allergens and irritants into indoor and outdoor air'
- 'Step 3: Storm damage releases particulate matter, dust, debris, and construction-related
  pollutants into the air'
- 'Step 4: Displacement and shelter conditions expose populations to crowding, poor
  ventilation, and increased respiratory pathogen transmission'
- 'Step 5: Healthcare system disruption limits access to respiratory medications,
  oxygen therapy, and acute care services'
- 'Step 6: These combined exposures exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions
  (COPD, asthma) and trigger new respiratory illness, leading to increased hospitalizations
  and mortality'

description: Hurricane and storm exposure significantly increases respiratory disease
  hospitalizations through multiple biological pathways including post-storm environmental
  contamination (mold, particulate matter, allergens), disruption of healthcare access
  and medication availability, and crowded shelter conditions promoting respiratory
  pathogen transmission. Meta-analysis of 71 studies found a statistically significant
  15% increased risk of respiratory disease hospitalizations following cyclone exposure,
  with COPD patients experiencing a 26% increased hospitalization risk.
