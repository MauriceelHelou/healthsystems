mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carvedilol acts as a non-selective β-blocker, blocking both β1 and β2 adrenergic
  receptors, reducing cardiac output and splanchnic blood flow'
- 'Step 2: Carvedilol''s intrinsic α1-adrenergic blocking activity produces vasodilatory
  effects that ameliorate hepatic vascular resistance'
- 'Step 3: The reduction in hepatic vascular resistance directly targets a major mechanism
  of portal hypertension in early cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: Combined reduction in splanchnic inflow and hepatic vascular resistance
  leads to decreased portal venous pressure'
- 'Step 5: Lower portal pressure reduces risk of decompensation events (variceal bleeding,
  ascites) in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension'

description: 'Carvedilol therapy reduces portal hypertension through a dual mechanism:
  non-selective β-blockade decreases cardiac output and splanchnic blood flow, while
  its intrinsic α1-blocking vasodilatory activity reduces hepatic vascular resistance.
  This competing-risk meta-analysis of 4 RCTs (352 patients) demonstrated that carvedilol
  significantly reduced risk of decompensation (SHR 0.506) and improved survival in
  patients with compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension.'
