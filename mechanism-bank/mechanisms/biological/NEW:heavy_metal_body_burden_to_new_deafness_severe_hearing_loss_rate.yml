mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Accumulated heavy metals in the body exert ototoxic effects'
- 'Step 2: Oxidative stress and cellular damage occur in cochlear structures'
- 'Step 3: Hair cell death and auditory nerve damage progress over time'
- 'Step 4: Hearing loss advances to severe or profound levels in susceptible individuals'

description: Heavy metal body burden from environmental exposure leads to severe hearing loss through
  progressive ototoxic damage to the auditory system. This meta-analysis examines the relationship between
  heavy metal pollution and hearing loss across multiple population-based studies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The progression from heavy metal exposure to severe hearing loss reflects cumulative
    disadvantage. Populations with higher environmental exposure (due to residential location, occupation,
    or food sources) face greater risk of disability from hearing loss. This has downstream effects on
    employment, social participation, and quality of life, compounding existing inequities.
