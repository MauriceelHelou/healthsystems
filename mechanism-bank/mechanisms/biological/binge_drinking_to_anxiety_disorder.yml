description: Adolescent alcohol consumption increases anxiety-related behaviors through neurobiological
  pathways, consistent with evidence that alcohol directly affects brain regions and neurotransmitter
  systems involved in anxiety regulation.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism shows how structural alcohol availability creates mental health
    burdens for youth. Rather than framing anxiety as individual pathology, this recognizes environmental
    exposure to alcohol as a structural determinant of adolescent mental health.
