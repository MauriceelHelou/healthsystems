  toxic effects of alcohol metabolites on pancreatic tissue'

  of acute alcoholic pancreatitis with high recurrence rates'

  increased hospitalizations for pancreatitis'

description: Alcohol use disorder increases pancreatitis hospitalization rates through
  direct toxic effects on pancreatic tissue. Studies show that 82.3% of alcoholic
  acute pancreatitis patients have alcohol use disorder, with readmission rates of
  28-43% within 11 months. The COVID-19 pandemic showed a 3.67-fold increased odds
  of alcoholic pancreatitis hospitalizations, demonstrating the strong relationship
  between alcohol use disorder and pancreatitis-related healthcare utilization.
structural_competency_notes: Racial disparities exist in alcohol-related pancreatitis,
  with African Americans disproportionately affected during COVID-19. Employment status
  significantly influences relapse rates, and there is regional variation in treatment
  access and outcomes across different geographical areas.
