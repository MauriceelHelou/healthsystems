direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep loss (total deprivation, partial restriction, or fragmentation) disrupts normal restorative
  sleep processes'
- 'Step 2: Disruption of sleep architecture affects neurobiological systems regulating emotional experience'
- 'Step 3: Reduced positive affect emerges, with high arousal positive states most adversely affected'
- 'Step 4: Diminished capacity for positive emotional experiences undermines psychological well-being'

description: Sleep loss in all forms (total deprivation, partial restriction, fragmentation) results in
  reduced positive affect, with standardized mean differences ranging from -0.27 to -1.14. This meta-analysis
  of 154 studies demonstrates consistent negative effects of inadequate sleep on positive emotional experiences.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Sleep loss is often structurally determined by work schedules (shift work, multiple
    jobs), economic pressures, housing instability, neighborhood noise, and caregiving responsibilities
    that disproportionately affect low-income and marginalized populations. The emotional consequences
    of sleep deprivation compound existing health inequities.
