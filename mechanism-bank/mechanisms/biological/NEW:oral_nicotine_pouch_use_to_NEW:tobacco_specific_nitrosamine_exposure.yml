direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ONP use substitutes for cigarette smoking'
- 'Step 2: Reduced combustion exposure decreases carcinogen intake'
- 'Step 3: Lower NNAL (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) levels in urine'
- 'Step 4: Decreased biomarker indicates reduced carcinogenic exposure'

description: ONP use may result in lower tobacco-specific nitrosamine (NNAL) levels compared to continued
  smoking, suggesting reduced carcinogenic exposure, though evidence is very uncertain

  description: No difference in NNAL levels between higher- and lower-dose ONP (SMD -0.16, 95% CI -1.87
    to 1.56)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Biomarker evidence for harm reduction has implications for regulatory policy and
    product standards. The difference in NNAL levels between ONP and continued smoking, if confirmed,
    could support harm reduction frameworks that provide safer alternatives to combustible tobacco, particularly
    for populations unable to achieve complete abstinence.
