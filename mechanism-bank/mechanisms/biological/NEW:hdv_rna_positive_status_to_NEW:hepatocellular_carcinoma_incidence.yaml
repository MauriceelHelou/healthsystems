direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Active HDV replication (HDV RNA+ status) in hepatocytes leads to persistent
  and severe hepatic inflammation compared to HBV monoinfection'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation accelerates hepatocyte damage, oxidative stress, and
  compensatory cellular proliferation'
- 'Step 3: Progressive liver fibrosis develops more rapidly, leading to compensated
  and then decompensated cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: The cirrhotic microenvironment with ongoing inflammation, regenerative
  nodule formation, and genomic instability promotes hepatocarcinogenesis'
- 'Step 5: Increased rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in HDV RNA+
  patients compared to HDV RNA- patients'

description: 'Hepatitis Delta Virus RNA positive status is significantly associated
  with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients co-infected with HBV.
  A meta-analysis of 12 studies found that HDV RNA+ patients have nearly 3-fold higher
  risk of HCC (HR 2.97, 95% CI: 1.87-4.70) compared to HDV RNA- patients. This increased
  risk is mediated through accelerated liver disease progression, with HDV RNA+ status
  also associated with higher rates of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis,
  liver transplantation, and liver-related mortality.'
