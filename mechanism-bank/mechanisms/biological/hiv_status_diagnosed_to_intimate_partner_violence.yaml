direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HIV diagnosis creates disclosure-related vulnerabilities, where women may
  face partner blame, accusations of infidelity, or fear of disclosure'
- 'Step 2: HIV status intersects with other syndemic factors (substance abuse, economic
  dependence) creating synergistic risk interactions that amplify violence risk'
- 'Step 3: Women living with HIV may experience increased partner control, economic
  abuse, or physical violence as partners react to perceived sexual risk or stigma
  associated with HIV status'
- 'Step 4: The SAVA (Substance Abuse, Violence, AIDS) syndemic creates geographic
  clustering where HIV, alcohol use, and IPV co-occur and interact synergistically
  to elevate violence risk'

description: HIV diagnosis is significantly associated with increased risk of intimate
  partner violence through syndemic mechanisms. Evidence from systematic review of
  19 African studies and nationally representative South African data demonstrates
  that HIV-positive women face 1.48-3.10 times higher odds of IPV compared to HIV-negative
  women. The relationship operates through the SAVA (Substance Abuse, Violence, AIDS)
  syndemic framework, where HIV, alcohol use, and violence interact synergistically
  rather than merely additively. Geographic analysis reveals clustering of these syndemic
  interactions in specific high-risk areas, with synergy indices indicating multiplicative
  rather than additive effects on physical violence risk.
