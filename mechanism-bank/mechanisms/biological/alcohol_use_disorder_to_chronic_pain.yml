mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advanced AUD is characterized by neuroadaptive changes in brain reward and stress systems'
- 'Step 2: Koob''s Dark Side of Addiction theory posits that chronic heavy drinking leads to allostatic
  dysregulation'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological changes in pain processing pathways emerge with progression of AUD'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-induced hyperalgesia develops, where alcohol consumption paradoxically increases pain
  sensitivity'
- 'Step 5: This manifests as increased pain interference among men with elevated AUD symptomatology who
  consume more alcohol'

description: Among men with higher AUD symptom counts, higher baseline alcohol consumption was significantly
  related to higher subsequent pain interference at follow-up. This pattern is consistent with Koob's
  Dark Side of Alcohol Addiction theory, suggesting that the detrimental effect of alcohol on pain emerges
  at relatively advanced stages of AUD specifically among men.

  description: The detrimental alcohol-to-pain relationship at advanced AUD stages was specifically observed

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illuminates how alcohol use disorder progression fundamentally alters
    the alcohol-pain relationship. Structural determinants of AUD development and treatment access (alcohol
    policy environment, treatment facility availability, insurance coverage for SUD treatment) may indirectly
    determine whether individuals progress to stages where alcohol worsens rather than alleviates pain.
    Gender-specific differences suggest potential biological or social factors requiring further investigation.
