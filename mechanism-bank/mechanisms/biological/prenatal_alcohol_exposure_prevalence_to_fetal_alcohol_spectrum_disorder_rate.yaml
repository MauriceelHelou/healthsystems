direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy exposes the developing fetus
  to ethanol, which crosses the placental barrier and enters fetal circulation'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol disrupts normal fetal neurodevelopment through multiple mechanisms
  including altered DNA methylation, impaired cell growth and differentiation, and
  oxidative stress damage to developing brain structures'
- 'Step 3: These developmental disruptions manifest as the spectrum of physical, cognitive,
  and behavioral abnormalities that characterize fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,
  with severity correlating with exposure level and timing'

description: Prenatal alcohol exposure directly causes fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
  through teratogenic effects on the developing fetus. Higher prevalence of maternal
  alcohol consumption during pregnancy leads to proportionally higher rates of FASD
  in the population. The relationship is dose-dependent, with heavier drinking and
  binge drinking patterns associated with more severe forms of FASD including fetal
  alcohol syndrome. Population studies consistently demonstrate this causal relationship
  across diverse geographic regions and ethnic groups.
structural_competency_notes: Structural factors significantly influence this pathway
  through differential access to prenatal care, alcohol treatment services, and FASD
  prevention programs. Socioeconomic disadvantage, geographic isolation, and systemic
  discrimination create barriers to intervention. Aboriginal and Indigenous populations
  show disproportionately high FASD rates due to historical trauma, poverty, and limited
  healthcare access, as demonstrated in multiple studies from South Africa, Canada,
  and Australia.
