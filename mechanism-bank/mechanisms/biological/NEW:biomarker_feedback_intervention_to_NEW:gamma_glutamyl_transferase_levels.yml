mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Biomarker-based advice is integrated into routine alcohol care'
- 'Step 2: Patients receive personalized feedback showing elevated GGT indicating liver injury'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption following intervention decreases ongoing hepatocellular damage'
- 'Step 4: Liver enzyme levels normalize as hepatocyte injury decreases'
- 'Step 5: Measurable reduction in serum GGT levels indicates improved liver health'

description: Biomarker-based intervention advice reduces GGT levels by 19.7 IU/l compared to control groups,
  indicating improved liver function as a biological marker of reduced alcohol-related harm.

  equity_implications: This biological mechanism demonstrates how healthcare system interventions can
    produce measurable improvements in organ function. The structural element is the healthcare delivery
    system's capacity to monitor and respond to biomarker changes, enabling early intervention before
    progression to severe liver disease.
