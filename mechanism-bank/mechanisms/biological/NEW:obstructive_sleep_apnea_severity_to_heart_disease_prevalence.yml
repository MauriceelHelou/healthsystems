direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Obstructive sleep apnea causes repeated upper airway obstruction during sleep'
- 'Step 2: Airway obstruction leads to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia'
- 'Step 3: Intermittent hypoxia triggers oxidative stress and systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Repeated arousal from sleep activates sympathetic nervous system and increases blood pressure
  variability'
- 'Step 5: Chronic exposure to these physiological stressors promotes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
  disease'

description: The study population had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (mean AHI 31.2 events/hour)
  and established cardiovascular disease, with 71% having hypertension. OSA contributes to cardiovascular
  risk through mechanisms including intermittent hypoxia, oxidative stress, sympathetic activation, and
  inflammation.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'OSA prevalence and severity are influenced by structural determinants including:
    obesity rates shaped by food environments and built environment factors affecting physical activity;
    occupational exposures affecting respiratory health; access to diagnostic sleep studies which may
    be limited by insurance coverage, specialist availability, and geographic factors; and socioeconomic
    factors affecting sleep quality and duration. Underdiagnosis of OSA is common, particularly in underserved
    communities with limited access to sleep medicine services.'
