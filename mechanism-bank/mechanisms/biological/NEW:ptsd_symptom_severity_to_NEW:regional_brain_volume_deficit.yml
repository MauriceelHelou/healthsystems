direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: More severe PTSD symptoms reflect greater trauma load and/or inadequate treatment access'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged symptom burden increases chronic neurobiological stress'
- 'Step 3: Sustained activation of stress response systems leads to greater neurotoxic effects'
- 'Step 4: More pronounced gray matter volume reductions occur with more severe/persistent symptoms'

description: Greater regional brain volume deficits were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms, suggesting
  a dose-response relationship between symptom burden and structural brain changes.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Symptom severity is not purely individual - it is shaped by access to evidence-based
    treatment, social support systems, ongoing trauma exposure, and economic stability. Mental health
    provider shortages, lack of trauma-informed care, and insurance barriers create structural conditions
    for more severe, persistent symptoms and thus greater neurobiological damage.
