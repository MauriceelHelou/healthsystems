mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in Alcohol Use Disorder causes direct neurotoxic
  damage to brain tissue, particularly affecting astrocytes and neurons'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier
  disruption lead to astrocyte activation and damage'
- 'Step 3: Damaged and activated astrocytes release S100B protein, which normally
  resides intracellularly, into the extracellular space'
- 'Step 4: S100B crosses the compromised blood-brain barrier and enters systemic circulation,
  resulting in elevated serum S100B levels'
- 'Step 5: Elevated serum S100B serves as a biomarker of ongoing brain damage, with
  particularly high levels during alcohol withdrawal syndrome and delirium tremens'

description: Alcohol Use Disorder is associated with elevated serum S100B levels,
  a biomarker of brain damage. Chronic alcohol exposure causes neurotoxic damage to
  astrocytes, which release S100B protein into circulation. Elevated S100B levels
  in AUD patients indicate ongoing neurodegeneration, with levels particularly elevated
  during alcohol withdrawal syndrome and in cases progressing to delirium tremens.
  S100B may also have a protective role for serotonergic neurons against alcohol-induced
  damage.
