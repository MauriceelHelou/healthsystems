direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Birth asphyxia occurs when the neonate experiences oxygen deprivation during
  or immediately after birth, resulting in hypoxia and hypercapnia'
- 'Step 2: Oxygen deprivation leads to rapid cellular injury, particularly affecting
  highly metabolically active tissues including the brain, heart, and kidneys'
- 'Step 3: Hypoxic-ischemic injury triggers multi-organ failure, neurological damage,
  and metabolic acidosis within hours of birth'
- 'Step 4: Without immediate resuscitation and supportive care, the cascade of cellular
  damage results in neonatal death, predominantly within the first 24 hours of life'

description: Birth asphyxia is the leading cause of neonatal mortality on the first
  day of life, accounting for 68.1% of day-1 deaths. This systematic review of 48
  studies with over 6.7 million live births and 47,551 neonatal deaths demonstrates
  that 38.8% of all neonatal deaths occur within the first 24 hours, with birth asphyxia
  being the primary driver of this early mortality. The biological mechanism involves
  acute oxygen deprivation leading to rapid multi-organ failure, particularly affecting
  the brain and cardiovascular system, resulting in death if not immediately addressed
  through resuscitation.
