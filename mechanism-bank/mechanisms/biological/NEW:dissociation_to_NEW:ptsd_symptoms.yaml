category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dissociation develops as a defensive response to overwhelming trauma, particularly
  childhood maltreatment and intimate partner violence, fragmenting the integration
  of consciousness, memory, identity, and perception'
- 'Step 2: Dissociative processes disrupt normal emotional processing and memory consolidation,
  preventing the adaptive integration of traumatic experiences into autobiographical
  memory'
- 'Step 3: The failure to integrate traumatic memories leads to intrusive re-experiencing
  symptoms, as unprocessed trauma fragments emerge involuntarily through flashbacks
  and nightmares'
- 'Step 4: Dissociation serves as a bridge symptom connecting trauma exposure to the
  full PTSD symptom constellation, including avoidance, hyperarousal, and negative
  alterations in cognition and mood'

description: Dissociation functions as a critical bridge symptom linking trauma exposure
  (particularly childhood maltreatment and intimate partner violence) to PTSD symptoms.
  Network analysis revealed that dissociation indirectly connects these traumatic
  experiences to the development and maintenance of PTSD symptomatology, operating
  through disruptions in emotional processing and maladaptive coping strategies.
