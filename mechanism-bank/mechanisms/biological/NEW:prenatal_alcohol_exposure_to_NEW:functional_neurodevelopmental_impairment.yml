mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol crosses blood-brain barrier of developing fetus'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol causes neuronal apoptosis and disrupts synaptogenesis'
- 'Step 3: White matter development and myelination are impaired'
- 'Step 4: Functional deficits manifest across multiple neurodevelopmental domains'

  description: Data often lacking across full range of exposures, limiting dose-response characterization
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Neurodevelopmental impairments from prenatal alcohol exposure reflect structural
    upstream factors including alcohol policy environment, access to treatment services, healthcare screening
    practices, and social determinants. These outcomes create lifelong disability requiring educational
    and social support services, with equity implications for service access across populations.
