direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Glucocorticosteroids are administered orally or parenterally to patients
  with alcoholic hepatitis'
- 'Step 2: Glucocorticosteroids bind to glucocorticoid receptors and exert anti-inflammatory
  effects by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell activation'
- 'Step 3: The theoretical reduction in necroinflammation characteristic of alcoholic
  hepatitis should reduce liver damage and improve outcomes'
- 'Step 4: However, clinical evidence shows no significant effect on mortality, serious
  adverse events, or liver-related outcomes, suggesting the anti-inflammatory mechanism
  may be insufficient to alter disease course'

description: Glucocorticosteroids are theoretically used as anti-inflammatory drugs
  for alcoholic hepatitis, targeting the necroinflammation characteristic of the disease.
  This Cochrane systematic review of 15 randomized clinical trials (1861 participants)
  found no evidence of benefit for glucocorticosteroids compared to placebo or no
  intervention on all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.15), serious adverse
  events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.85-1.29), or liver-related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI
  0.69-1.14). While the biological mechanism of anti-inflammatory action is well-established,
  clinical evidence does not support meaningful reduction in inflammation-related
  outcomes.
