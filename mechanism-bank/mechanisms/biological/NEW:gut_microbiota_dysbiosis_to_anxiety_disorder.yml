- 'Step 1: Intestinal flora imbalance from chronic alcohol use disrupts gut-brain axis'
- 'Step 2: Bidirectional signaling between enteric and central nervous systems becomes dysregulated'
- 'Step 3: Amygdala function within the gut-limbic circuit is affected'
- 'Step 4: Anxiety-like behavior manifests as demonstrated in microbiota transfer experiments'

description: Gut microbiota dysbiosis from alcohol use disorder contributes to anxiety through disruption
  of gut-brain axis communication and limbic system dysfunction.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This biological pathway offers therapeutic intervention points for anxiety in AUD
    that address underlying mechanisms rather than individual behavioral change alone.
