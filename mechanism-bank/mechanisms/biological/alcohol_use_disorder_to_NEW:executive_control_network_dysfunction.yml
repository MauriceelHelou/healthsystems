direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol dependence causes neuroadaptive changes in prefrontal and executive brain regions'
- 'Step 2: Functional connectivity between executive control networks and other brain systems becomes
  disrupted'
- 'Step 3: This dysfunction impairs decision-making, impulse control, and goal-directed behavior'
- 'Step 4: Executive control network alterations were identified as key features distinguishing AUD from
  controls'

description: Feature selection analysis identified functional connections involving executive control
  networks as among the most relevant for classifying AUD, indicating that alcohol dependence produces
  measurable alterations in brain circuits responsible for cognitive control and decision-making.

  equity_implications: 'Executive control dysfunction has important equity implications: individuals in
    high-stress environments (poverty, discrimination, unstable housing) face both increased allostatic
    load that may impair executive function AND reduced structural supports (treatment access, stable
    employment) to compensate. The identification of executive control network involvement suggests AUD
    treatment should address structural barriers that overwhelm cognitive control capacity rather than
    expecting individuals to simply ''choose'' sobriety.'
