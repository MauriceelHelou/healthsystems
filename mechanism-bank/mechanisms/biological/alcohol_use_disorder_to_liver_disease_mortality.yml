description: Alcohol use disorder causes methylation changes in liver tissue that alter gene expression
  and contribute to liver pathology. The review specifically discusses alcohol's effects on methylation
  in the liver as a site of AUD pathophysiology.

    and liver damage
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Liver disease from AUD disproportionately affects populations with limited access
    to treatment and healthcare. Structural factors including lack of insurance, treatment facility availability,
    and social stigma create barriers to intervention before irreversible liver damage occurs.
