description: The only MR study examining all-cause mortality found a detrimental association with genetically
  predicted alcohol consumption, contradicting the observational 'J-curve' showing moderate drinking associated
  with lower mortality.

  equity_implications: This finding has significant policy implications. If alcohol truly has no protective
    effect on mortality, alcohol control policies (taxation, outlet density restrictions, marketing bans)
    would unequivocally benefit population health. The 'moderate drinking is healthy' narrative may reflect
    residual confounding in observational studies where moderate drinkers have higher socioeconomic status
    and better healthcare access. Structural interventions to reduce alcohol availability would address
    health inequities given that alcohol-related harms are concentrated in disadvantaged communities.
