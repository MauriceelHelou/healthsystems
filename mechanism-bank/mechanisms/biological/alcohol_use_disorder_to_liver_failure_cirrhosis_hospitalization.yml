- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to chronic heavy alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes gut microbiome dysbiosis'
- 'Step 3: Dysbiosis increases gut permeability and bacterial translocation'
- 'Step 4: Liver inflammation from endotoxins combined with direct alcohol toxicity'
- 'Step 5: Progressive liver damage culminates in alcohol-associated liver disease requiring hospitalization'

description: The gut microbiome serves as a mechanistic pathway linking alcohol use disorder to alcohol-associated
  liver disease, with dysbiosis contributing to liver pathology.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: AUD and AALD are shaped by structural determinants including alcohol policy environment,
    treatment access, economic stress, and social conditions. The cross-sectional nature of most studies
    limits understanding of how structural interventions might interrupt this pathway. Research gaps in
    female and diverse populations reflect systemic biases in biomedical research.
