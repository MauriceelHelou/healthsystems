direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure reduces connectivity between dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum'
- 'Step 2: Diminished corticostriatal connectivity impairs cognitive control over reward-related behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Reduced prefrontal modulation of striatal activity weakens ability to override craving'
- 'Step 4: Individuals cannot effectively engage executive control to resist alcohol-seeking'
- 'Step 5: Diminished regulatory capacity increases likelihood of treatment dropout'

description: Treatment completers showed enhanced functional connectivity between striatum and right dorsolateral
  prefrontal cortex compared to non-completers. This suggests that intact corticostriatal connectivity,
  which supports cognitive control over reward-related behaviors, is protective against treatment dropout.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The presence of protective corticostriatal connectivity in treatment completers
    suggests that neural resilience factors influence treatment outcomes. Treatment programs should consider
    neuroimaging-informed approaches to identify individuals who may need additional support due to deficient
    regulatory circuitry.
