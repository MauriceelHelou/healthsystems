category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sustained heavy alcohol consumption in AUD leads to chronic hepatocyte injury'
- 'Step 2: Repeated cycles of injury and repair trigger hepatic stellate cell activation'
- 'Step 3: Activated stellate cells produce excessive collagen leading to progressive fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: End-stage fibrosis results in cirrhosis with architectural distortion and portal hypertension'

description: Among individuals with alcohol use disorder, 12.9% have alcohol-associated cirrhosis, compared
  to only 0.3% in general populations and 1.7% in primary care. This represents a severe progression of
  liver disease concentrated in the AUD population.

  description: Cirrhosis prevalence is 12.9% in AUD populations vs 0.3% in general populations vs 1.7%
    in primary care - approximately 40-fold difference between general population and AUD settings
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The concentration of cirrhosis in AUD populations highlights failures in early
    intervention and treatment access. Structural barriers to AUD treatment including stigma, lack of
    insurance coverage, limited treatment capacity, and inadequate screening in healthcare settings allow
    liver disease to progress to end-stage cirrhosis. Equity implications include differential access
    to transplantation and advanced care for marginalized populations.
