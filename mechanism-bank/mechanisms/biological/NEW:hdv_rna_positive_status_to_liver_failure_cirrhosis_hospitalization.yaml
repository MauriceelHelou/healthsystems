direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) requires Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) surface antigen
  (HBsAg) for its replication and assembly, establishing co-infection or superinfection
  in HBV-positive individuals'
- 'Step 2: Active HDV replication (indicated by HDV RNA positive status) causes direct
  hepatocyte injury and triggers robust inflammatory responses in the liver'
- 'Step 3: Persistent HDV-mediated inflammation accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis through
  activation of hepatic stellate cells and excessive extracellular matrix deposition'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis leads to architectural distortion and nodular regeneration
  characteristic of cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: Compensated cirrhosis progresses to decompensated cirrhosis with portal
  hypertension and hepatic dysfunction, requiring hospitalization for complications
  such as ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy'

description: 'Patients with detectable HDV RNA have a significantly greater risk of
  progressing to cirrhosis compared to HDV RNA-negative patients. The meta-analysis
  found HDV RNA positivity associated with a 74% increased risk of compensated cirrhosis
  (RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.24-2.45) and a nearly 4-fold increased risk of decompensated
  cirrhosis (HR: 3.82, 95% CI: 1.60-9.10). This reflects the aggressive nature of
  HDV co-infection in accelerating liver disease progression in HBV-infected individuals.'
