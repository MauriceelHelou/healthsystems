description: 'No significant difference between metformin and myo-inositol on BMI (SMD=-0.22, 95% CI:
  -0.60-0.16, p=.265), indicating equivalent short-term effects on body weight in PCOS women.'

    option may improve treatment uptake and adherence, particularly in populations with limited healthcare
    access.
