direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use produces neuroadaptation in dopaminergic reward circuitry'
- 'Step 2: Functional connectivity patterns in reward networks become altered'
- 'Step 3: These changes affect motivation, pleasure response, and reinforcement learning'
- 'Step 4: Reward network connectivity was identified as a key discriminating feature for AUD classification'

description: Feature selection identified reward network connectivity as a key distinguishing feature
  of AUD, reflecting how chronic alcohol exposure alters the brain's reward circuitry and contributes
  to the persistent nature of alcohol dependence.

  equity_implications: 'Reward network alterations have critical structural implications: communities
    lacking alternative sources of reward and meaning (employment opportunities, recreational facilities,
    social supports) may have higher vulnerability to alcohol-related reward pathway hijacking. Structural
    interventions that provide meaningful alternatives (job programs, community centers, green spaces)
    may help prevent or treat AUD by offering competing sources of reward activation.'
