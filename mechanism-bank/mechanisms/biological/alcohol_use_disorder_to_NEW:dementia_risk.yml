description: Chronic alcohol misuse accelerates brain aging and contributes to cognitive impairments.
  The consensus across multiple disciplines (clinical, epidemiological, neuropsychological, pathological,
  neuroimaging, and translational studies) is that alcohol misuse increases dementia risk, though not
  necessarily Alzheimer's disease specifically. Key distinguishing factors include the reversibility of
  alcohol-related brain damage with abstinence versus the progressive nature of Alzheimer's, and the absence
  of characteristic protein inclusions (present in Alzheimer's) in AUD-affected brains.

    approximately one-third of those older than 85 diagnosed with dementia
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights the importance of addressing alcohol use disorder at
    a population health level, particularly given that current alcohol consumption among older adults
    is significantly higher compared to previous generations. Structural interventions should focus on
    treatment access, harm reduction, and addressing upstream determinants of alcohol misuse rather than
    individual blame. The aging demographic shift (21.6% of Americans will be over 65 by 2040) creates
    urgency for structural prevention approaches.
