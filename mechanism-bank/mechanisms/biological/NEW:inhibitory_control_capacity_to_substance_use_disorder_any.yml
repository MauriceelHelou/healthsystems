direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhibitory control capacity determines ability to resist immediate impulses and cravings for
  substance use'
- 'Step 2: Stronger inhibitory control enables individuals to override automatic approach behaviors toward
  substances'
- 'Step 3: This relationship is moderated by underlying white matter integrity - stronger inhibition is
  most protective when neural infrastructure is intact'
- 'Step 4: For individuals with highest white matter integrity (FA values), strong inhibitory control
  translates to lowest probability of substance use in daily life'

description: Stronger inhibitory control (measured via Stroop task in daily life) predicts lower probability
  of substance use, but this relationship is moderated by white matter integrity. The protective effect
  of inhibition is most pronounced for individuals with the highest white matter integrity in anterior
  brain systems.

  description: White matter integrity in anterior brain regions moderates the link between inhibitory
    control and substance use. The protective effect of strong inhibitory control against substance use
    is greatest when white matter integrity is highest (highest FA values).
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals how neurobiological vulnerability interacts with cognitive
    control. Structural factors affecting brain health (chronic stress from poverty, environmental toxin
    exposure, lack of treatment access, historical trauma) can compromise white matter integrity and reduce
    the protective capacity of inhibitory control. Equity implications include differential access to
    interventions that support neural recovery and cognitive rehabilitation.
