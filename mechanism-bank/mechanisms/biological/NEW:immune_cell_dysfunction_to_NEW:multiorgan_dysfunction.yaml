mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol misuse impairs organ-specific immune cells including microglia
  in the brain, alveolar macrophages in the lungs, and Kupffer cells in the liver'
- 'Step 2: These immune cells lose their ability to regulate inflammatory signaling
  and maintain metabolic homeostasis'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulated inflammatory responses and impaired tissue repair capacity
  lead to progressive damage across multiple organ systems'
- 'Step 4: Immune dysfunction is further exacerbated by aging processes and gut barrier
  leakage, compounding multiorgan dysfunction'

description: Alcohol misuse leads to dysregulation of organ-specific immune cells
  (microglia, alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells), impairing their ability to maintain
  host immune defense, tissue repair, and homeostasis. This immune cell dysfunction
  contributes to inflammatory dysregulation and metabolic impairment across multiple
  organ systems, resulting in multiorgan dysfunction that increases morbidity and
  mortality risk in individuals with alcohol use disorders.
