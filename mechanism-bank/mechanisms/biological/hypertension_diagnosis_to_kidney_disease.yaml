  node_id: kidney_disease
  node_name: Chronic Kidney Disease
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated systolic blood pressure (>140 mmHg) creates sustained mechanical
  stress on glomerular capillaries and renal vasculature'
- 'Step 2: Chronic hypertension leads to arteriolosclerosis and hyalinosis of renal
  arterioles, reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery to nephrons'
- 'Step 3: Glomerular hyperfiltration and subsequent glomerulosclerosis occur as compensatory
  mechanisms fail'
- 'Step 4: Progressive nephron loss and fibrosis result in declining glomerular filtration
  rate (GFR) and development of chronic kidney disease'

description: Systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg is significantly associated with a
  3.26-fold increased odds of chronic kidney disease among diabetic patients. Elevated
  blood pressure damages renal microvasculature through mechanical stress, leading
  to arteriolosclerosis, glomerular injury, and progressive nephron loss. This relationship
  is particularly pronounced in the context of diabetes where hyperglycemia and hypertension
  synergistically accelerate kidney damage.
