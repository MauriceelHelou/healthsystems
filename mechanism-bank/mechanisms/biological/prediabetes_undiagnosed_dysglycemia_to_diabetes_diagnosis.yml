direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Impaired glucose regulation/prediabetes represents intermediate glycemic state with metabolic
  changes'
- 'Step 2: Metabolites including lactate and formiminoglutamate are significantly different between prediabetes
  and diabetes states'
- 'Step 3: These metabolites mediate the progression effect from baseline to follow-up at 18 and 48 months'
- 'Step 4: Identified metabolite markers enable risk stratification for targeted intervention before progression
  to diabetes'

description: The study identified metabolites that significantly differ between impaired glucose regulation/prediabetes
  and type 2 diabetes states. These metabolites mediate the effect of diabetes progression from baseline
  to follow-up, enabling identification of individuals at highest risk for progression who could benefit
  from targeted interventions.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Prediabetes prevalence is shaped by structural factors including food environment,
    walkability, economic stress, and healthcare access for screening. Metabolite-based risk stratification
    could enable more equitable allocation of prevention resources to communities with highest structural
    risk. Alcohol and smoking as moderators reflect upstream social determinants.
