  node_name: Alcohol Withdrawal (Severe) Rate
  node_type: crisis_endpoint
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
  - 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol use causes neuroadaptation with downregulated GABA-A receptors and upregulated NMDA receptors'
  - 'Step 2: Abrupt cessation or reduction removes alcohol''s GABAergic inhibition while excitatory systems remain upregulated'
  - 'Step 3: Glutamate-mediated hyperexcitability produces autonomic instability, tremor, agitation, and seizure risk within 6-24 hours'
  - 'Step 4: In 5-10% of cases, withdrawal progresses to delirium tremens (DT) with hallucinations, disorientation, and severe autonomic dysfunction'
  - 'Step 5: Severe DT manifests as hyperthermia, tachycardia >120, profound confusion, and can be fatal without benzodiazepine treatment'

  equity_implications: Severe alcohol withdrawal disproportionately affects individuals without stable housing, healthcare access, or social support who cannot safely detoxify. People experiencing homelessness cycle through untreated withdrawal in emergency departments and jails rather than receiving appropriate medical detoxification. The high rate of severe withdrawal in marginalized populations reflects systematic failures to provide accessible addiction treatment and social services, not individual choices. Policies that criminalize addiction and defund treatment programs directly increase severe withdrawal and associated mortality.
assumptions:
  - 'Assumes abrupt cessation after sustained heavy use (>8 drinks/day for weeks to months)'
  - 'Withdrawal timeline varies by individual drinking history and metabolism'
  - 'Risk stratification assumes no prophylactic benzodiazepine treatment'
limitations:
  - 'Only 5-10% of alcohol withdrawal progresses to severe DT'
  - 'Mechanism does not account for protective effect of medical supervision and benzodiazepine protocols'
  - 'Genetic factors influencing GABA/NMDA receptor regulation create individual variability'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Severe withdrawal rates vary by access to medical detoxification facilities, harm reduction services, and hospital protocols
  relevant_geographies:
    - 'Rural areas lack detoxification facilities forcing ED-based management'
    - 'Urban safety-net hospitals concentrate uninsured severe withdrawal cases'
    - 'States with Medicaid-funded residential detox show lower severe withdrawal mortality'
    - 'Correctional facilities show high rates due to abrupt forced cessation without adequate medical monitoring'
