category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher naïve CD4+ T-cell fractions indicate preserved thymic output and
  immune system regenerative capacity, reflecting a younger immunological age'
- 'Step 2: Naïve CD4+ T-cells provide a reservoir of uncommitted immune cells capable
  of responding to novel antigens and pathogens'
- 'Step 3: Adequate naïve T-cell pools enable effective immune surveillance against
  infections, malignancies, and other threats that contribute to mortality'
- 'Step 4: Maintained naïve CD4+ T-cell populations may indicate reduced chronic inflammation
  and immunosenescence, both associated with age-related diseases and mortality'
- 'Step 5: The inverse association with all-cause mortality persists independently
  of epidemiological risk factors and baseline co-morbidity, suggesting a direct biological
  protective effect'

description: Higher fractions of naïve CD4+ T-cells in blood are associated with reduced
  risk of all-cause mortality. This meta-analysis of 22 cohorts (23,053 samples for
  phenotype associations, 4,386 for health outcomes) found that naïve CD4+ T-cell
  fractions independently predicted reduced mortality risk even after controlling
  for major epidemiological risk factors and baseline co-morbidity. A machine learning
  predictor using immune-cell fractions achieved a C-index of 0.69 for all-cause mortality,
  increasing to 0.83 when combined with epidemiological factors.
