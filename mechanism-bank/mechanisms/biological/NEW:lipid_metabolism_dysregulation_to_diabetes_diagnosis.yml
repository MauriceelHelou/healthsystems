description: Causal inference using Mendelian randomization with genetic variants demonstrates that lipid
  metabolism and n-3 fatty acids play a causal role in the metabolite-to-type 2 diabetes pathway. Lysophosphatidylcholine
  a C17:0 was significantly associated with glycemic status.

  equity_implications: Lipid metabolism is influenced by dietary fat intake, which is shaped by food environment,
    economic resources for healthy food purchase, and cultural food practices. Structural inequities in
    food access create differential exposure to dietary patterns that dysregulate lipid metabolism.
