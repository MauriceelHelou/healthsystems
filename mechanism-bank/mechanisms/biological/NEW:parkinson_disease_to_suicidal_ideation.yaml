direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parkinson''s disease causes progressive neurodegeneration affecting dopaminergic
  pathways in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra and related circuits'
- 'Step 2: Dopaminergic dysfunction disrupts reward processing, mood regulation, and
  executive function, contributing to high rates of depression and mood disorders
  in PD patients'
- 'Step 3: The combination of neurobiological changes, chronic progressive disability,
  motor symptoms, and comorbid depression increases vulnerability to suicidal ideation'
- 'Step 4: Approximately 22.2% of PD patients experience suicidal ideation, with mood
  disorders being particularly prevalent among those reporting suicidality'

description: This meta-analysis of 28 studies comprising over 500,000 Parkinson's
  disease patients found that 22.2% experienced suicidal ideation and 1.25% exhibited
  suicidal behavior. PD patients had approximately twice the risk of suicidal behavior
  compared to controls (OR=2.15, HR=1.73). The relationship is mediated by neurobiological
  changes affecting mood regulation, with depression being particularly prevalent
  among PD patients reporting suicidality.
