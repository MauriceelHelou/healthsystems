direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Asian individuals demonstrate significantly lower mortality from alcohol-associated
  liver disease (ALD) compared to White individuals in the United States'
- 'Step 2: This protective effect may relate to genetic variations in alcohol metabolism
  enzymes (e.g., ADH1B and ALDH2 polymorphisms) that are more prevalent in Asian populations,
  leading to adverse reactions to alcohol and lower consumption rates'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption patterns and potentially different drinking behaviors
  contribute to reduced ALD development and progression'
- 'Step 4: The combined effect of genetic protection and behavioral factors results
  in substantially lower liver disease mortality among Asian populations (OR: 0.1
  compared to White individuals)'

description: 'Asian race/ethnicity is associated with significantly lower alcohol-associated
  liver disease mortality compared to White individuals in the United States. This
  meta-analysis of 16 studies found a strong protective effect (OR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.03-0.5),
  representing a 90% reduction in ALD mortality risk. This was the only statistically
  significant racial/ethnic difference in ALD mortality identified in the analysis,
  suggesting unique protective factors in Asian populations related to genetic alcohol
  metabolism variations and associated behavioral patterns.'
