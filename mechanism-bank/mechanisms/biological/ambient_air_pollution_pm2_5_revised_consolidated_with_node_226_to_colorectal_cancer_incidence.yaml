direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM2.5 particles leads to systemic distribution of particulate
  matter and associated chemical components throughout the body via the bloodstream'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 and its constituents (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
  heavy metals, and other carcinogens) reach the gastrointestinal tract through systemic
  circulation and potentially through mucociliary clearance and swallowing'
- 'Step 3: Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are induced in colorectal tissue
  by PM2.5 components, leading to DNA damage, epigenetic alterations, and disruption
  of cellular repair mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Sustained inflammatory response and oxidative damage promote genomic instability
  and cellular proliferation in colorectal epithelium'
- 'Step 5: Accumulation of genetic mutations and epigenetic changes over time increases
  the probability of malignant transformation and colorectal cancer development'

description: 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 studies found that PM2.5
  exposure is associated with a 35% increased risk of colorectal cancer (RR=1.35,
  95% CI: 1.08-1.62). All included studies identified an increased risk for colorectal
  cancer, making it one of the most robust associations among gastrointestinal cancers
  examined. The biological plausibility is supported by known mechanisms of PM2.5-induced
  systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and carcinogenic effects of PM constituents
  on gastrointestinal tissues.'
