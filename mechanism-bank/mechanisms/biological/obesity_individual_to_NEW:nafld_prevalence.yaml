mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excess adipose tissue in obesity leads to increased free fatty acid release
  into circulation through lipolysis'
- 'Step 2: Elevated free fatty acids are taken up by hepatocytes, exceeding the liver''s
  capacity for oxidation and export'
- 'Step 3: Excess lipids accumulate as triglycerides in hepatocytes (hepatic steatosis),
  leading to NAFLD development'
- 'Step 4: Obesity-associated insulin resistance further promotes hepatic de novo
  lipogenesis and reduces lipid export'
- 'Step 5: Chronic adipose tissue inflammation releases pro-inflammatory cytokines
  that contribute to hepatic inflammation and disease progression'

description: Obesity is a major driver of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
  which is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. This systematic review
  of 237 studies involving over 13 million participants in Asia demonstrated that
  NAFLD prevalence is strongly associated with obesity prevalence in the population.
  The biological mechanism involves excess adiposity leading to increased hepatic
  lipid accumulation through free fatty acid flux and insulin resistance-mediated
  lipogenesis. The study identified obese individuals, particularly older men, as
  high-risk groups requiring targeted public health interventions.
