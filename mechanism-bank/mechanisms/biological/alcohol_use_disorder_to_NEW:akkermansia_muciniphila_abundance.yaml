  node_name: Akkermansia muciniphila Gut Abundance
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive ethanol consumption characteristic of alcohol use disorder
  directly impacts the gut microbiome environment'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol and its metabolites (particularly acetaldehyde) create a hostile
  environment for Akkermansia muciniphila, a Gram-negative commensal bacterium that
  typically resides in the intestinal mucosa'
- 'Step 3: Over-intake of ethanol induces a decrease in the relative abundance of
  A. muciniphila in the gut microbiota'
- 'Step 4: Reduced A. muciniphila levels lead to dysregulation of microbial metabolite
  production, impaired intestinal permeability, and compromised mucin degradation
  capacity'
- 'Step 5: This depletion contributes to chronic inflammation and cytokine production,
  further destabilizing the gut ecosystem and perpetuating reduced A. muciniphila
  colonization'

description: Alcohol use disorder leads to decreased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila
  in the gut microbiota through direct toxic effects of ethanol on this beneficial
  commensal bacterium. A. muciniphila normally plays a protective role in maintaining
  intestinal barrier integrity through mucin degradation and modulation of intestinal
  permeability. Chronic alcohol exposure depletes this bacterial population, contributing
  to gut dysbiosis, impaired intestinal permeability, chronic inflammation, and cytokine
  production that characterizes alcohol-related liver disease progression.
