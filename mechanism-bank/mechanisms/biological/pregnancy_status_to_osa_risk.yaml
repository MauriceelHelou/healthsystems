- 'Step 1: Pregnancy induces significant physiological changes including weight gain
  and fluid retention'
- 'Step 2: Hormonal changes during pregnancy affect respiratory drive and upper airway
  dimensions'
- 'Step 3: Increased abdominal pressure and supine positioning difficulties affect
  sleep architecture'
- 'Step 4: These pregnancy-related changes increase risk and severity of OSA'
