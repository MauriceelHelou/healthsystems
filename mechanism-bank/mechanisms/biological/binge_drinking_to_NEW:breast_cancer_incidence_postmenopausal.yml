description: Each additional standard drink (10g ethanol) per day is associated with a 10% increased risk
  of postmenopausal breast cancer, a stronger effect than observed for premenopausal breast cancer (3%
  increase). This suggests postmenopausal women may be particularly vulnerable to alcohol's carcinogenic
  effects.

  description: Analyses by hormone receptor status and HER2 status were performed, suggesting differential

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Postmenopausal women face compounded structural vulnerabilities including age-related
    healthcare access barriers and targeted alcohol marketing. Policy interventions such as warning labels
    on alcohol products about breast cancer risk, restrictions on alcohol advertising, and minimum unit
    pricing could reduce population-level exposure. Healthcare system screening protocols should incorporate
    alcohol consumption assessment.
