mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Residual vascular obstruction persists after acute pulmonary embolism'
- 'Step 2: Perfusion defects detectable on imaging suggest incomplete thrombus resolution'
- 'Step 3: Despite anatomical abnormalities, quality of life measures may not directly correlate'
- 'Step 4: Other factors including psychosocial support, rehabilitation access, and comorbidities may
  have greater influence on quality of life'

description: The systematic review found NO association between perfusion defects or residual vascular
  obstruction and quality of life outcomes. This null finding suggests that anatomical/physiological abnormalities
  alone do not determine patient-reported quality of life, indicating other factors (potentially including
  social support, mental health, rehabilitation access) may be more important determinants of post-PE
  recovery.

  equity_implications: The lack of association between anatomical defects and quality of life suggests
    that structural and social determinants beyond the biological may significantly influence recovery.
    Access to cardiac rehabilitation, mental health support for anxiety/PTSD after PE, social support
    networks, and ability to take time off work for recovery may be more important than vascular anatomy
    alone. This finding has equity implications as patients with fewer socioeconomic resources may have
    worse quality of life despite similar vascular status.
