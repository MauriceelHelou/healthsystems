direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol neurotoxicity during adolescent brain development disrupts normal
  patterns of synaptic pruning and myelination'
- 'Step 2: Altered developmental trajectories lead to increased structural covariance
  between distant brain regions'
- 'Step 3: Greater long-distance covariance increases the efficiency of information
  transfer across the entire network'
- 'Step 4: Elevated global efficiency reflects compensatory reorganization or pathological
  deviation from optimal small-world architecture'
