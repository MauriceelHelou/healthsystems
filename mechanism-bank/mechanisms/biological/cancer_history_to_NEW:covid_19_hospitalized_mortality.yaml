direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cancer and cancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy) cause
  immunosuppression, reducing the body''s ability to mount effective antiviral responses
  against SARS-CoV-2'
- 'Step 2: Immunocompromised state leads to impaired viral clearance, allowing prolonged
  viral replication and higher viral loads'
- 'Step 3: Cancer patients often have systemic inflammation and compromised organ
  function, increasing vulnerability to COVID-19-related complications such as cytokine
  storm and multi-organ failure'
- 'Step 4: These factors combined result in more severe disease progression and increased
  mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with malignancies'

description: Malignancies/cancer history is identified as a significant predictor
  of mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis
  of 87 studies found that after adjustment for confounders, malignancies ranked as
  the third strongest predictor of mortality (after diabetes mellitus and chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease). The effect operates through immunosuppression from
  both the cancer itself and its treatments, leading to impaired viral defense mechanisms.
