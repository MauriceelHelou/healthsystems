direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD leads to altered prefrontal cortex function during reward processing'
- 'Step 2: The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for reward valuation and decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Increased OFC activation during reward outcome in AUD patients may reflect compensatory processes
  or aberrant value computation'
- 'Step 4: This altered OFC response may contribute to dysfunctional reward valuation and decision-making
  in AUD'

description: AUD patients show increased orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward outcome, potentially
  reflecting compensatory mechanisms or altered reward valuation processes distinct from subcortical reward
  deficits.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding of increased OFC activation alongside decreased striatal activation
    reveals the complexity of neural adaptations in AUD, highlighting that the disorder involves both
    hypo- and hyper-activation patterns across different brain regions.
