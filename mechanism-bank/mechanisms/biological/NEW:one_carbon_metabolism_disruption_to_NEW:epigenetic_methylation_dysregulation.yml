description: The review highlights one carbon metabolism as the central pathway through which alcohol
  affects methylation. This metabolic pathway generates methyl groups that are transferred to DNA, histones,
  and RNA, making it a key mediator of alcohol's epigenetic effects.

  description: Poor nutrition, particularly folate deficiency common in AUD, may exacerbate one carbon
    metabolism disruption
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Nutritional deficiencies that exacerbate one carbon metabolism disruption are more
    prevalent in populations experiencing food insecurity and poverty. Structural factors including food
    desert residence and economic hardship compound alcohol's metabolic effects.
