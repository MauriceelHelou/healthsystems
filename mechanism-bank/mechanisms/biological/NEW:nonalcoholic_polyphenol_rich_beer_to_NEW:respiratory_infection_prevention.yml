direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nonalcoholic beer contains polyphenols with antioxidant properties'
- 'Step 2: Polyphenols may modulate immune function and reduce oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Heavy training increases susceptibility to respiratory infections due to immunosuppression'
- 'Step 4: Antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects may counteract training-induced immune depression'
- 'Step 5: Reduced incidence or severity of upper respiratory tract infections'

description: Nonalcoholic, polyphenol-rich beer may help prevent respiratory infections during periods
  of heavy training by providing antioxidant support to counter exercise-induced immune suppression.

  equity_implications: This has implications for athletic program policies, availability of nonalcoholic
    options in sports contexts, and occupational health for professional athletes. The structural environment
    often promotes alcoholic over nonalcoholic beverages.
