direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence and young adulthood occurs during
  critical periods of brain maturation and synaptic pruning'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol neurotoxicity disrupts normal patterns of cortical thickness development
  and regional brain maturation'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted cortical development alters structural covariance patterns between
  adjacent brain regions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced similarity in cortical thickness between neighboring regions manifests
  as decreased clustering coefficient in structural covariance networks'
