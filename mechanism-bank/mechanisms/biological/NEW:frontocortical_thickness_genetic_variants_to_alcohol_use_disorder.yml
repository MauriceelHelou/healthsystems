description: Genetic variants associated with decreased frontocortical thickness show overlap between
  alcohol consumption and AUD, suggesting shared neuroanatomical vulnerability characterized by reduced
  frontal cortical structure.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The finding that frontocortical thickness genetic variants are shared between consumption
    and AUD supports structural interventions that protect frontal cortical function (limiting neurotoxic
    exposures, reducing consumption opportunities) rather than expecting individuals to overcome neurobiological
    vulnerabilities through willpower.
