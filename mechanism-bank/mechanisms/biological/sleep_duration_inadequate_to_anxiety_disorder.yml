- 'Step 1: Experimental sleep reduction through deprivation, restriction, or fragmentation disrupts sleep
  architecture'

- 'Step 3: Hyperactivation of anxiety-related neural circuits and stress response systems'
- 'Step 4: Increased anxiety symptoms emerge, contributing to risk for psychiatric disorders'

description: Sleep loss increases anxiety symptoms with standardized mean differences of 0.57-0.63. This
  demonstrates that inadequate sleep serves as a catalyst for anxiety, with experimental evidence supporting
  a causal pathway from sleep disruption to increased psychiatric risk.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Structural factors that impair sleep access (precarious employment requiring shift
    work, noisy or unsafe housing, lack of paid sick leave preventing recovery from illness, economic
    stress) create conditions for both sleep loss and anxiety, disproportionately affecting marginalized
    populations who face multiple structural barriers.
