mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bipolar disorder involves dysregulation of prefrontal-limbic circuits'
- 'Step 2: Impaired reward processing and executive function even during euthymic periods'
- 'Step 3: Reduced ability to integrate feedback from consequences of decisions'
- 'Step 4: Poor performance on Iowa Gambling Task relative to healthy comparison participants'

  and functional capacity compared to healthy comparison participants, even when receiving treatment,
  highlighting an unmet therapeutic need.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The persistence of cognitive impairment in treated bipolar disorder reflects gaps
    in healthcare system capacity to address functional outcomes beyond symptom control. Structural factors
    including insurance coverage for cognitive rehabilitation, access to specialized psychiatric care,
    and social support systems influence functional outcomes. Socioeconomically disadvantaged populations
    with BD may face compounded barriers to achieving functional recovery.
