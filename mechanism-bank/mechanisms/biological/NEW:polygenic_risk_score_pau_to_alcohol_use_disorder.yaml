  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Polygenic risk scores aggregate the effects of 110 identified independent
  risk variants associated with problematic alcohol use across multiple ancestries'
- 'Step 2: These genetic variants influence gene expression and chromatin interactions
  in brain tissues, affecting neural pathways related to reward, impulse control,
  and addiction vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Prioritized genes through brain tissue analysis contribute to neurobiological
  susceptibility for alcohol-related behaviors and dependence'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative genetic liability indexed by PRS increases individual risk for
  developing alcohol use disorder through these biological mechanisms'

description: Polygenic risk scores for problematic alcohol use capture cumulative
  genetic liability across 110 independent risk variants identified in a multi-ancestry
  GWAS of over 1 million individuals. These variants influence brain gene expression
  and chromatin interactions, creating neurobiological vulnerability that increases
  risk for alcohol use disorder. The genetic architecture shows high cross-ancestral
  similarity, and cross-ancestry PRS demonstrate improved predictive validity for
  AUD risk in independent samples.
