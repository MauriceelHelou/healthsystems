description: Open bar party attendance is associated with higher rates of clinical psychiatric symptoms
  among early adolescents, potentially reflecting bidirectional relationships between mental health and
  high-risk drinking environments
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 5213
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The association may reflect both vulnerability (youth with psychiatric symptoms
    seeking coping through alcohol) and causation (alcohol exposure worsening mental health). Either pathway
    points to policy failure in protecting vulnerable youth from commercial alcohol promotion.
