mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Postpartum hemorrhage occurs predominantly within the first 24 hours after
  delivery, typically due to uterine atony, retained placental tissue, genital tract
  trauma, or coagulation disorders'
- 'Step 2: Rapid and severe blood loss leads to hypovolemic shock, with the average
  woman losing critical blood volume within minutes to hours without intervention'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate or delayed access to emergency obstetric care (blood transfusion,
  uterotonic drugs, surgical intervention) during this critical window results in
  irreversible organ damage and death'
- 'Step 4: The concentration of hemorrhage-related deaths on day 1 (79.1% of all PPH
  deaths) demonstrates the acute, time-sensitive nature of this pathway to maternal
  mortality'

description: Postpartum hemorrhage occurring on the first day after delivery is the
  single largest contributor to maternal mortality during the postpartum period. This
  systematic review of 32 studies found that 79.1% of all deaths due to postpartum
  hemorrhage occurred on day 1, far exceeding other causes. The biological pathway
  involves rapid blood loss leading to hypovolemic shock, with death occurring within
  hours without appropriate emergency intervention. This concentration of mortality
  on day 1 underscores the critical importance of skilled birth attendance and immediate
  postpartum monitoring.
