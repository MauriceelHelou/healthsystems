direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains numerous chemical compounds that are metabolized
  within cells, particularly hepatic cells'
- 'Step 2: Metabolism of tobacco compounds through xenobiotic metabolic pathways (involving
  enzymes like CYP2E1) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) as byproducts'
- 'Step 3: Excessive ROS generation exposes cellular DNA to continuous oxidative stress'
- 'Step 4: Sustained oxidative stress leads to DNA damage and triggers protective
  repair machinery (ATM, ATR, H2AX, MRN complex)'
- 'Step 5: Chronic ROS generation can also activate or repress epigenetic elements
  affecting gene expression and contributing to cellular dysfunction'

description: Current smoking promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species within
  cells through the metabolism of tobacco compounds via xenobiotic metabolic pathways.
  This excessive ROS generation exposes cellular DNA to continuous oxidative stress,
  leading to DNA damage and activation of repair mechanisms. Genetic polymorphisms
  in metabolic enzymes can influence individual susceptibility to tobacco-induced
  ROS generation and subsequent pathological consequences.
