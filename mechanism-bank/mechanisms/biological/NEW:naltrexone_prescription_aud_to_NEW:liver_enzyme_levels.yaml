direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Naltrexone prescription for AUD supports reduced alcohol consumption through
  opioid receptor antagonism, decreasing cravings and reward from drinking'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol intake decreases ongoing hepatotoxic injury from ethanol
  and its metabolites (acetaldehyde) to hepatocytes'
- 'Step 3: With decreased hepatocellular damage, release of intracellular enzymes
  AST and ALT into the bloodstream is reduced'
- 'Step 4: Measured serum liver enzyme levels decline, reflecting improved hepatic
  status and reduced inflammation'

description: Naltrexone prescription for alcohol use disorder is associated with significant
  reductions in liver enzyme levels (AST and ALT). In a retrospective cohort of 160
  patients including those with liver disease and cirrhosis, adjusted mean AST and
  ALT levels were significantly lower after versus before naltrexone prescription
  (p < 0.001). This effect was consistent across patients without liver disease, those
  with liver disease without cirrhosis, and those with cirrhosis, supporting the hepatic
  safety of naltrexone while suggesting indirect hepatoprotective benefits through
  reduced alcohol consumption.

  description: Decompensated cirrhosis patients had higher hospitalization rates,
    though enzyme improvements were still observed; more data needed for this subgroup
