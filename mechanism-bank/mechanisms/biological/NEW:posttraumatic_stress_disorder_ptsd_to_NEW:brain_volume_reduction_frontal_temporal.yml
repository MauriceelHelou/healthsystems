direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to traumatic events triggers PTSD psychopathology'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stress response and dysregulated fear/memory processing affect neural structures'
- 'Step 3: Sustained neurobiological stress leads to gray matter volume reductions in frontal and temporal
  lobes'
- 'Step 4: Structural changes in these regions impair emotional regulation and cognitive function'

description: PTSD patients exhibit widespread smaller gray matter volumes across frontal and temporal
  lobes compared to controls, with deficits correlating with symptom severity. This meta-analysis of 36
  cohorts provides robust evidence for structural brain changes in PTSD.

  equity_implications: PTSD is often rooted in structural exposures including community violence, military
    combat related to socioeconomic factors driving military enlistment, intimate partner violence, and
    other traumas that disproportionately affect marginalized populations. The brain changes represent
    biological embedding of social trauma. Addressing PTSD requires upstream interventions targeting violence
    prevention, economic opportunity, and trauma-informed systems.
