direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic stress exposure leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis, resulting in altered cortisol secretion patterns and stress hormone
  imbalances'
- 'Step 2: HPA axis dysfunction affects central neurotransmitter systems including
  dopaminergic reward pathways and GABAergic inhibitory circuits, increasing vulnerability
  to alcohol''s reinforcing effects'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress states induce negative affect, anxiety, and depressive symptoms,
  which promote alcohol use as a maladaptive coping mechanism (self-medication)'
- 'Step 4: Repeated alcohol use in response to stress leads to neuroadaptations in
  stress and reward circuits, creating a cycle of escalating use from binge/heavy
  drinking to alcohol use disorder'

description: Chronic stress promotes alcohol use disorder through central and peripheral
  biological mechanisms involving HPA axis dysregulation, neuroadaptations in stress
  and reward circuits, and negative affect states that drive alcohol use as maladaptive
  coping. This pathway involves both direct neurobiological effects of stress hormones
  on brain reward systems and indirect pathways through stress-induced psychological
  states (depression, anxiety) that increase alcohol's subjective reinforcing value.
