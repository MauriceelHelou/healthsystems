direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Periodontal disease causes chronic oral infection with persistent inflammation
  and bacterial burden in the oral cavity'
- 'Step 2: Systemic dissemination of oral pathogens and inflammatory mediators occurs
  through bacteremia and cytokine release into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 3: Chronic systemic inflammation promotes atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction,
  and cardiovascular damage over time'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), coronary
  heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death'
- 'Step 5: Elevated cardiovascular mortality and other systemic complications contribute
  to increased all-cause mortality'

description: 'Periodontal disease is associated with a 31% increased risk of all-cause
  mortality (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.61). This meta-analysis of 39 cohort studies
  with over 4.3 million individuals demonstrates that chronic periodontal infection
  leads to systemic inflammation and increased cardiovascular risk, which in turn
  elevates overall mortality risk. The association appears robust across sensitivity
  analyses.'
