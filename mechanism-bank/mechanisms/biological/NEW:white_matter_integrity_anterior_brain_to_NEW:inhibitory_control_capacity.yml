mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural integrity of white matter pathways in anterior corpus callosum and bilateral anterior
  corona radiata provides neural infrastructure for executive function'
- 'Step 2: Higher fractional anisotropy (FA) values indicate preserved myelination and axonal organization
  in frontal-subcortical circuits'
- 'Step 3: Intact white matter connectivity supports efficient signal transmission between prefrontal
  cortex and subcortical regions involved in response inhibition'
- 'Step 4: Preserved neural infrastructure enables stronger functional connectivity in occipital-frontal-cerebellar
  networks during inhibitory control tasks'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced network connectivity translates to better performance on everyday inhibitory control
  tasks (Stroop performance)'

description: Higher white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy) in the anterior corpus callosum and
  bilateral anterior corona radiata predicts better inhibitory control performance, as measured by Stroop
  task performance in daily life via ecological momentary assessment.

  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on biological pathways, structural factors upstream
    (substance exposure history, environmental stressors, socioeconomic conditions) contribute to white
    matter integrity. Substance use disorders that compromise white matter may reflect cumulative environmental
    exposures rather than individual choice. Treatment access and quality are structural determinants
    affecting neural recovery potential.
