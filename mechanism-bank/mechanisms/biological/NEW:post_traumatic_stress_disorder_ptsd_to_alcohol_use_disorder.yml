mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Trauma exposure leads to development of PTSD with associated neurobiological changes'
- 'Step 2: PTSD causes dysregulation in stress-responsive neurocircuitry including the amygdala, prefrontal
  cortex, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with PTSD may use alcohol as a coping mechanism to self-medicate symptoms (self-medication
  hypothesis)'
- 'Step 4: Chronic alcohol use induces neuroadaptations in overlapping brain circuits'
- 'Step 5: Bidirectional reinforcement between PTSD symptoms and alcohol consumption leads to comorbid
  AUD'

description: PTSD and AUD frequently co-occur, with bidirectional relationships mediated by shared neurobiological
  mechanisms. This review examines how preclinical animal models can be used to study the neurocircuitry
  underlying this comorbidity.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this paper focuses on neurobiological mechanisms, structural factors contributing
    to trauma exposure (e.g., community violence, military service, poverty) represent upstream determinants.
    Populations with higher structural trauma exposure (lower-income communities, veterans, racial minorities
    experiencing discrimination) face greater risk of PTSD-AUD comorbidity. Treatment approaches must
    address both conditions simultaneously, requiring integrated healthcare systems.
