direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption produces neuroadaptations in brain reward circuitry'
- 'Step 2: Mesocorticolimbic terminal regions undergo functional reorganization'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced connectivity develops between striatum, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex'
- 'Step 4: These connectivity changes persist during resting state'
- 'Step 5: Altered network organization reflects pathological adaptations that maintain alcohol-seeking'

description: Individuals with alcohol use disorder showed stronger resting-state functional connectivity
  between striatum, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex compared to healthy controls, demonstrating
  that AUD is associated with measurable alterations in brain network organization.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding demonstrates that AUD produces objective, measurable changes in brain
    circuitry. This supports understanding addiction as a brain disorder rather than a moral failing,
    which has implications for reducing stigma and designing evidence-based treatments.
