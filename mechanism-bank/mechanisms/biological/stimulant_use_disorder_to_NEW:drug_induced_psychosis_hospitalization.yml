description: Pre-criminal justice system methamphetamine use is associated with subsequent hospitalization
  for drug-induced psychosis. This systematic review found consistent associations across 5 health outcome
  studies, suggesting that methamphetamine's neurotoxic effects on dopamine systems increase risk of psychotic
  episodes requiring hospitalization.

  description: CJS contact serves as a critical context where pre-existing methamphetamine use translates
    to subsequent psychiatric hospitalization
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how the intersection of substance use disorders and criminal
    justice involvement creates pathways to serious mental illness. The CJS often serves as a point of
    contact for individuals with untreated substance use disorders, and lack of treatment during CJS contact
    perpetuates adverse outcomes. Structural factors include inadequate substance use treatment within
    CJS settings and limited community-based treatment options.
