direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) accumulate
  in plasma'
- 'Step 2: BCAAs and their metabolites (N-lactoylvaline, N-lactoylleucine) interfere with insulin signaling
  pathways'
- 'Step 3: Impaired insulin sensitivity leads to compensatory hyperinsulinemia and beta-cell stress'
- 'Step 4: Progressive glycemic dysregulation manifests as transition from normal glucose regulation to
  prediabetes to type 2 diabetes'

description: Branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) and novel N-lactoyl-amino acid metabolites
  (N-lactoylvaline, N-lactoylleucine) are significantly associated with progression across the glycemic
  spectrum from normal glucose regulation to prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. These metabolites mediate
  the effect of diabetes progression over 18-48 month follow-up.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism focuses on biological pathways, BCAA levels are influenced
    by dietary patterns shaped by food access, food deserts, and socioeconomic factors. Populations with
    limited access to diverse, healthy foods may have metabolite profiles that increase diabetes risk.
    Identified markers could enable targeted interventions in high-risk populations.
