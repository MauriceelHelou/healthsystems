  node_name: Gut Barrier Leakage
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking exposes the gastrointestinal tract to high concentrations
  of alcohol, which damages intestinal epithelial cells and disrupts tight junction
  proteins'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species that
  further compromise the integrity of the intestinal barrier'
- 'Step 3: The weakened gut barrier allows translocation of bacterial products (endotoxins/lipopolysaccharides)
  and other luminal contents into the systemic circulation'
- 'Step 4: Gut barrier leakage exacerbates alcohol-induced immune cell dysfunction,
  creating a feedback loop that worsens multiorgan dysfunction'

description: Binge drinking contributes to gut barrier leakage through direct damage
  to intestinal epithelial cells and disruption of tight junctions. This leakage allows
  bacterial endotoxins to enter systemic circulation, which exacerbates immune dysregulation
  and multiorgan dysfunction. The relationship is bidirectional, as gut barrier leakage
  further impairs immune cell function that is already compromised by alcohol misuse.
