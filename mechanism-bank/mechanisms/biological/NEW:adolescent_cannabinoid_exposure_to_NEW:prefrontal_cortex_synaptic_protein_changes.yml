description: Adolescent cannabinoid exposure leads to lasting changes in prefrontal cortex synaptic proteins,
  with 487 differentially expressed proteins identified. SYNGAP1 upregulation is spatio-temporally specific,
  occurring only in synaptic compartments and only after prolonged abstinence, suggesting developmental
  vulnerability during adolescence.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how substance exposure during critical developmental
    windows creates lasting neurobiological changes. From a structural perspective, this suggests that
    policies regulating cannabis access for adolescents, school-based prevention programs, and community-level
    factors affecting adolescent substance use have long-term neurobiological consequences. The adolescent-specific
    vulnerability suggests targeted policy approaches are needed for youth populations. Inequitable access
    to prevention resources and differential enforcement of cannabis laws may create disparate exposure
    patterns across communities.
