description: Mendelian randomization analysis provides evidence for a causal relationship between lower
  cognitive performance and increased alcohol use disorder risk (β=0.11, SE=0.02, p=2.6×10⁻¹²). This approach
  uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to reduce confounding bias inherent in observational
  studies.

  equity_implications: The MR finding strengthens causal inference but must be interpreted within structural
    context. Cognitive performance is shaped by structural factors including educational access, nutrition,
    environmental exposures, and healthcare quality. The genetic pathway likely interacts with these structural
    determinants. Policy implications include investing in early childhood development and education as
    upstream prevention for AUD.
