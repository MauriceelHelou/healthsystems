direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression involves neurobiological changes including dysregulation of
  serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems, as well
  as HPA axis dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: These neurobiological alterations lead to cognitive distortions including
  hopelessness, worthlessness, and negative rumination that characterize depressive
  states'
- 'Step 3: Depression-associated cognitive patterns impair problem-solving abilities
  and amplify perceptions of psychological pain and burdensomeness'
- 'Step 4: The combination of neurobiological vulnerability, cognitive distortions,
  and emotional dysregulation increases the threshold for suicidal ideation emergence'
- 'Step 5: Suicidal ideation develops as depression severity increases, with comorbid
  conditions (anxiety, PTSD, pain) and psychosocial stressors (living alone, financial
  problems) further elevating risk'

description: Depression is consistently identified as one of the strongest risk factors
  for suicidal ideation across diverse populations including cancer patients, healthcare
  workers during COVID-19, and Parkinson's disease patients. The relationship operates
  through both biological mechanisms (neurotransmitter dysregulation, neuroinflammation)
  and psychological mechanisms (hopelessness, cognitive distortions, impaired problem-solving).
  Meta-analytic evidence demonstrates that individuals with depression have approximately
  twice the odds of developing suicidal ideation compared to those without depression,
  with the relationship being strengthened by comorbid psychiatric conditions, social
  isolation, chronic pain, and psychosocial stressors.
