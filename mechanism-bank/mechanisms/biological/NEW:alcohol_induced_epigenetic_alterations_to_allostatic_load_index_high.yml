description: Alcohol-induced epigenetic alterations during prenatal development lead to persistent HPA
  axis dysfunction, which contributes to elevated allostatic load through chronic dysregulation of stress
  response systems.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates biological embedding of prenatal exposures into lifelong
    health vulnerability. The epigenetic changes represent how structural conditions during pregnancy
    (access to treatment, economic stress, alcohol policy environment) become written into biology and
    contribute to health inequities across generations.
