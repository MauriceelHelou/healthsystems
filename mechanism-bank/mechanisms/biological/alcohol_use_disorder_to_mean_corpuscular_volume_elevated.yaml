mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption in alcohol use disorder leads to direct toxic
  effects on erythrocyte precursors in bone marrow and disrupts normal DNA synthesis'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde which forms stable adducts with
  cellular constituents and proteins in erythrocytes, while also contributing to folate
  deficiency and nutritional deficiencies'
- 'Step 3: These combined effects result in production of larger, macrocytic red blood
  cells with elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV >100 fL)'

description: Alcohol use disorder causes elevated mean corpuscular volume through
  multiple interconnected mechanisms. Chronic alcohol consumption directly damages
  erythrocyte precursors in bone marrow and disrupts DNA synthesis. The primary metabolite
  acetaldehyde forms stable protein adducts within red blood cells, contributing to
  structural abnormalities. Additionally, alcohol-induced nutritional deficiencies,
  particularly folate deficiency, impair normal erythropoiesis. These combined effects
  result in the characteristic production of macrocytic red blood cells with MCV >100
  fL, observed in 62-82% of individuals with alcohol use disorder.
structural_competency_notes: Socioeconomic factors may influence this pathway through
  differential access to nutritious foods (exacerbating folate deficiency), healthcare
  screening for early detection, and treatment resources for alcohol use disorder,
  potentially leading to more severe macrocytosis in disadvantaged populations.
