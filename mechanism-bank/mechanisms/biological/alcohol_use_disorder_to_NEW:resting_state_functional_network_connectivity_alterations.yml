direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to neurotoxic effects on brain tissue and neural circuits'
- 'Step 2: Alterations occur in functional connectivity between visual, sensorimotor, executive control,
  reward, and salience networks'
- 'Step 3: These connectivity changes are detectable through resting state functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (rsFNC)'
- 'Step 4: Machine learning classifiers can identify AUD based on these distinctive connectivity patterns
  with AUC of 0.79'

description: Alcohol use disorder produces detectable alterations in resting state functional network
  connectivity, particularly involving visual, sensorimotor, executive control, reward, and salience networks.
  These neurobiological changes can be identified using machine learning classifiers applied to fMRI data,
  with neural network achieving AUC of 0.79 in distinguishing AUD subjects from controls.

moderators:
- name: nicotine_comorbidity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Previous studies were confounded by nicotine use; this study excluded nicotine users to
    isolate alcohol-specific effects, suggesting nicotine may have independent or interactive effects
    on brain connectivity
- name: classifier_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Neural network classifier showed highest performance (AUC 0.79); logistic regression, nearest
    neighbor, and SVM showed similar performance; Gaussian process and quadratic discriminant analysis
    performed worst
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'While this study focuses on biological markers of AUD, the findings have implications
    for structural approaches: (1) Detection tools could enable earlier identification and intervention;
    (2) The exclusion of polysubstance users highlights how structural factors promoting polysubstance
    use (poverty, lack of treatment access) complicate AUD research and treatment; (3) Brain network alterations
    in reward and executive control systems reflect neurobiological pathways through which structural
    stressors (economic insecurity, trauma) may interact with alcohol to produce disorder. The study design
    avoids individual blame by framing AUD as a condition with identifiable neurobiological signatures
    rather than moral failing.'
