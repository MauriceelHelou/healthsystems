mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Residual pulmonary vascular obstruction persists after acute PE'
- 'Step 2: Despite anatomical abnormalities, objective exercise capacity may not correlate with perfusion
  defects'
- 'Step 3: Compensatory mechanisms, deconditioning, and other comorbidities may have independent effects
  on exercise tolerance'
- 'Step 4: Cardiopulmonary exercise test parameters may reflect multifactorial influences beyond vascular
  anatomy'

description: The meta-analysis found NO association between perfusion defects or residual vascular obstruction
  and cardiopulmonary exercise test parameters. This suggests that objective measures of exercise capacity
  after PE may be determined by factors other than residual vascular anatomy, potentially including baseline
  fitness, deconditioning during acute illness, and access to rehabilitation.

  equity_implications: The dissociation between vascular defects and exercise capacity underscores the
    importance of access to cardiac/pulmonary rehabilitation programs. Patients with limited access to
    rehabilitation services due to geographic, financial, or insurance barriers may experience persistent
    functional impairment regardless of their vascular status. This has equity implications for rural
    populations and those without adequate healthcare coverage who cannot access post-PE rehabilitation
    programs.
