direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to inadequate dietary intake, impaired
  nutrient absorption and digestion, and abnormal ethanol-lipid metabolism interactions'
- 'Step 2: Protein-energy malnutrition develops with increased skeletal and visceral
  protein catabolism, leading to sarcopenia and muscle wasting'
- 'Step 3: Vitamin and trace element deficiencies accumulate, causing anemia and altered
  cognitive status'
- 'Step 4: As ALD progresses to cirrhosis, malnutrition exacerbates complications
  including ascites and hepatic encephalopathy'
- 'Step 5: The combined effects of sarcopenia, impaired immune function, and liver
  failure complications increase mortality risk in ALD patients'

description: Malnutrition is a common and prognostically significant finding in alcoholic
  liver disease. The etiology is multifactorial including inadequate dietary intake,
  impaired absorption and digestion, increased protein catabolism, and abnormal ethanol-lipid
  metabolism. As ALD progresses to cirrhosis, protein-energy malnutrition and sarcopenia
  become more prevalent, contributing to complications such as ascites and hepatic
  encephalopathy that increase mortality risk.
