direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Colistin and meropenem act synergistically against multidrug-resistant
  gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia through complementary mechanisms
  - colistin disrupts bacterial outer membrane integrity while meropenem inhibits
  cell wall synthesis'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced bacterial clearance reduces the systemic inflammatory response
  and bacterial burden in the lungs and bloodstream'
- 'Step 3: Decreased infection severity leads to reduced organ dysfunction across
  multiple systems (respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, coagulation, neurological)'
- 'Step 4: Improvement in organ function is reflected in lower Sequential Organ Failure
  Assessment (SOFA) scores, indicating better clinical outcomes'

description: Colistin plus meropenem combination therapy significantly reduces Sequential
  Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores compared to other colistin-based treatments
  in patients with nosocomial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative
  bacteria. This meta-analysis of 5 studies with 991 patients demonstrated a statistically
  significant reduction in SOFA scores (OR = -0.28, 95% CI = -0.44 to -0.11, p = 0.001),
  indicating improved organ function with the combination therapy.
