direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal inhalation of PM2.5 particles during pregnancy leads to systemic
  absorption of fine particulate matter and associated toxicants into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 exposure triggers systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory responses
  in the maternal system, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress affect placental function,
  potentially causing placental inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and reduced nutrient/oxygen
  transfer'
- 'Step 4: Placental dysfunction and systemic inflammation may trigger premature uterine
  contractions and cervical changes through prostaglandin pathways'
- 'Step 5: These physiological changes result in shortened gestational age and increased
  risk of preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation)'

description: Ambient PM2.5 pollution increases preterm birth risk through maternal
  systemic inflammation and oxidative stress pathways that affect placental function
  and trigger premature labor. Meta-regression of 40 studies found a 12% increased
  risk of preterm birth per 10 μg/m3 increment in ambient PM2.5. Globally, an estimated
  35.7% of all preterm births (approximately 5.87 million infants) were attributable
  to total PM2.5 exposure in 2019, with about one-third from ambient sources.
