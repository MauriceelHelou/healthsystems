direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption in AUD leads to altered hepatic transferrin
  glycosylation due to alcohol''s toxic effects on liver metabolism'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol interferes with the normal carbohydrate attachment process during
  transferrin synthesis in hepatocytes, reducing sialic acid content'
- 'Step 3: This results in increased circulating carbohydrate-deficient transferrin
  isoforms that can be measured as %CDT, serving as a biomarker of chronic alcohol
  consumption'

description: Alcohol use disorder causes elevated carbohydrate-deficient transferrin
  through chronic alcohol's direct toxic effects on hepatic transferrin glycosylation.
  Multiple studies consistently demonstrate that %CDT increases with alcohol consumption
  levels and serves as a sensitive and specific biomarker for detecting chronic excessive
  alcohol use, with values typically elevated above 1.7-2.5% in individuals with AUD
  compared to controls.
structural_competency_notes: Access to CDT testing may be limited by healthcare coverage
  and availability of specialized laboratory facilities, potentially creating disparities
  in objective alcohol use assessment across different socioeconomic populations.
  Cultural stigma around alcohol use disorders may also influence the clinical utility
  of this biomarker in certain communities.
