direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic pain leads to self-medication behavior where individuals use alcohol
  for its analgesic properties to alleviate pain symptoms'
- 'Step 2: Repeated alcohol use for pain relief leads to acute tolerance and the need
  for progressively higher alcohol consumption levels'
- 'Step 3: Chronic neurobiological changes from prolonged alcohol use entrench both
  pain hypersensitivity and alcohol dependence, creating a cycle where abstinence
  attempts trigger withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia and increased relapse risk'

description: Chronic pain prevalence increases the risk of alcohol use disorder through
  a self-medication pathway where individuals initially use alcohol for its analgesic
  effects. This leads to tolerance requiring higher consumption levels, and chronic
  neurobiological changes that create a reinforcing cycle between pain hypersensitivity
  and alcohol dependence.
structural_competency_notes: Access to appropriate pain management resources and integrated
  care models addressing both conditions simultaneously may modify this pathway, as
  inadequate pain treatment options may increase reliance on alcohol for pain relief.
