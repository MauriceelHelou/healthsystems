description: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes epigenetic suppression of opioid receptors, which interact
  with HPA axis function. This may contribute to altered pain perception and reward processing in affected
  offspring.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The suppression of opioid receptors through prenatal alcohol exposure may create
    vulnerability to substance use disorders, representing an intergenerational mechanism by which alcohol-related
    harms are transmitted. This underscores the importance of upstream interventions addressing maternal
    alcohol access and support.
