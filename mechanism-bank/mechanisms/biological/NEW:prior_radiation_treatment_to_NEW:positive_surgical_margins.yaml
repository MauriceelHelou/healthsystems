direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior radiation therapy to the head and neck region causes fibrosis and
  scarring of irradiated tissues, altering normal tissue planes and architecture'
- 'Step 2: Radiation-induced changes obscure the visual and tactile distinction between
  tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissue, making intraoperative margin assessment
  more difficult'
- 'Step 3: Tissue fibrosis and altered vascularity from prior radiation impair the
  surgeon''s ability to achieve adequate tumor clearance during salvage surgery'
- 'Step 4: The compromised tissue quality in previously irradiated fields leads to
  higher rates of positive surgical margins (19.4% in salvage cohorts vs. comparable
  rates in primary surgery with risk ratio of 1.08)'

description: Prior radiation treatment to the head and neck creates tissue fibrosis,
  scarring, and altered tissue planes that compromise a surgeon's ability to distinguish
  tumor from normal tissue during salvage surgery. This meta-analysis of 15 studies
  with 515 patients found positive surgical margins occurred in 19.4% of salvage cases
  in previously irradiated fields, with a risk ratio of 1.08 compared to primary (non-irradiated)
  head and neck cancer surgery, suggesting a modest increase in positive margin rates
  attributable to prior radiation.
