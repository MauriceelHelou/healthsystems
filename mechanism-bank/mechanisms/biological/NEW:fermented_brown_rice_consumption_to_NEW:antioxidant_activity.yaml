direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fermentation of brown rice by microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, or fungi)
  breaks down complex compounds in the bran layer'
- 'Step 2: Fermentation releases bound phenolic compounds and produces new bioactive
  metabolites with antioxidant properties'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced bioavailability of antioxidant compounds including gamma-oryzanol,
  ferulic acid, and other phenolics'
- 'Step 4: Increased concentrations of free radical scavenging molecules lead to elevated
  antioxidant activity in the fermented product'
- 'Step 5: Consumption of fermented brown rice delivers higher levels of bioavailable
  antioxidants to systemic circulation'

description: Fermentation of brown rice enhances its antioxidant activity through
  microbial biotransformation processes. The fermentation process releases bound phenolic
  compounds from the bran matrix, increases bioavailability of antioxidants like gamma-oryzanol
  and ferulic acid, and generates new bioactive metabolites with free radical scavenging
  properties. This results in fermented brown rice products having significantly higher
  antioxidant capacity compared to unfermented brown rice.
