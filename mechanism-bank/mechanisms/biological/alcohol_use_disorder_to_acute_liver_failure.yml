direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
  - 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol use in AUD causes progressive alcoholic liver disease (steatosis, hepatitis, fibrosis)'
  - 'Step 2: Acute-on-chronic liver failure is triggered by continued drinking, infection, GI bleeding, or medication toxicity'
  - 'Step 3: Hepatic decompensation develops rapidly with coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and multi-organ dysfunction'
  - 'Step 4: Acute alcoholic hepatitis produces severe inflammation with ballooning degeneration and neutrophil infiltration'
  - 'Step 5: Fulminant hepatic failure manifests with INR >1.5 and altered mental status, requiring intensive care'

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: interpersonal
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: While this mechanism describes biological pathways, AUD itself is shaped by structural factors including childhood trauma, economic deprivation, limited treatment access, and predatory alcohol marketing. Acute liver failure predominantly affects uninsured, marginalized individuals who lack access to early intervention and addiction treatment. The biological endpoint reflects cumulative failures of social support, healthcare systems, and alcohol policy, not individual moral failure.
assumptions:
  - 'Assumes untreated or inadequately treated AUD with continued heavy drinking'
  - 'Progression typically requires 10-20 years of heavy consumption'
  - 'ALF represents acute decompensation of chronic disease, not isolated acute toxicity'
limitations:
  - 'Only 5-10% of individuals with AUD progress to ALF'
  - 'Mechanism does not account for recovery with sustained abstinence and treatment'
  - 'Genetic susceptibility creates substantial individual variation in risk'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: ALF incidence varies by access to addiction treatment, liver transplant centers, and social safety net programs
  relevant_geographies:
    - 'Rural areas have limited access to hepatology specialists and addiction treatment'
    - 'Urban safety-net hospitals concentrate uninsured ALF cases'
    - 'Regions with Medicaid expansion show better outcomes through earlier intervention'
