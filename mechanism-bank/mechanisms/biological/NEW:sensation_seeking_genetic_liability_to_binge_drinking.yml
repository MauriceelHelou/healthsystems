- 'Step 1: Genetic variants influence expression of genes in midbrain dopaminergic and striatal reward
  circuitry'
- 'Step 2: Shared neurobiological architecture increases reward sensitivity and novelty-seeking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Overlapping genetic enrichment in midbrain and striatal tissues drives sensation-seeking phenotype'
- 'Step 4: Increased sensation seeking leads to greater alcohol consumption as a rewarding stimulus'

description: Genetic variants associated with sensation seeking overlap with those influencing alcohol
  consumption through shared neurogenetic architecture in midbrain and striatal tissues, characterized
  by increased cortical surface area variants.

  description: Association observed in both adult and adolescent samples, suggesting developmental period
    may moderate strength
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism is primarily biological/genetic, it identifies neural substrates
    that could be targets for structural interventions. Understanding that sensation seeking has shared
    genetic architecture with alcohol consumption shifts focus from individual blame to biological vulnerability
    influenced by developmental and environmental contexts.
