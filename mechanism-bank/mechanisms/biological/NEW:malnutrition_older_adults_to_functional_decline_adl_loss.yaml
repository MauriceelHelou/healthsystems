direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Malnutrition leads to inadequate protein and caloric intake, resulting
  in muscle protein breakdown and sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and strength)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced muscle mass and strength impairs physical capacity, balance, and
  mobility, particularly following acute events like hip fractures'
- 'Step 3: Compromised nutritional status delays tissue healing and recovery, prolonging
  rehabilitation periods'
- 'Step 4: Malnutrition increases risk of complications including delirium, which
  further disrupts functional recovery'
- 'Step 5: Combined effects result in declined mobility (41% increased risk) and transfer
  to more supported living arrangements (218% increased risk), indicating loss of
  independence in activities of daily living'

description: Malnutrition in older adults, particularly those experiencing hip fractures,
  significantly increases the risk of functional decline and loss of independence
  in activities of daily living. This meta-analysis of 14 studies found that malnourished
  older adults have 41% higher odds of declined mobility and 218% higher odds of requiring
  transfer to more supported living arrangements at 1 year post-fracture. The mechanism
  operates through sarcopenia, impaired healing, and increased complications including
  delirium.
