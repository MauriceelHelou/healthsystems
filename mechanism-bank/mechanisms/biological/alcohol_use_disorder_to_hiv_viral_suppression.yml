description: Alcohol use disorders in people living with HIV/AIDS represent a significant impediment to
  achieving virological control. The primary pathway is through sub-optimal antiretroviral therapy adherence,
  which is the main mechanism linking AUDs to HIV non-suppression. Effective ART and viral suppression
  are identified as two key pillars in reducing new HIV infections.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how comorbid conditions create compounding health inequities.
    People with intersecting marginalized identities (PLWH with AUDs) face structural barriers to both
    mental health treatment and HIV care. The framing appropriately identifies medication adherence as
    the pathway rather than blaming individual behavior.
