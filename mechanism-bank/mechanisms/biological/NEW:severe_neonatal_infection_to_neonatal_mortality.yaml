direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neonates acquire severe infections (sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis) through
  vertical transmission during birth, nosocomial exposure, or community-acquired pathogens
  in the postnatal period'
- 'Step 2: Immature neonatal immune systems are unable to mount adequate responses
  to overwhelming bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammatory response leads to multi-organ dysfunction, septic
  shock, respiratory failure, and metabolic derangements'
- 'Step 4: Without timely recognition and appropriate antimicrobial treatment, severe
  infection progresses rapidly to death, with peak mortality occurring between days
  2-7 of life'

description: Severe neonatal infection is a major biological pathway to neonatal mortality,
  accounting for nearly half (48.1%) of all cause-specific deaths occurring between
  days 2-7 of life. This systematic review of 51 studies encompassing over 6.7 million
  live births and 47,551 neonatal deaths demonstrates that while birth asphyxia dominates
  day 1 mortality, severe infection becomes the predominant cause of death in the
  subsequent days of the first week. The neonatal immune system's immaturity renders
  newborns highly susceptible to rapid disease progression from infection to sepsis
  and death.
