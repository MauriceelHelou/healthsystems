direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) involves atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories
  affecting brain structure, connectivity, and neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 2: These neurobiological differences create vulnerability to dysregulation
  in emotion processing, attention, arousal, and social cognition systems'
- 'Step 3: Shared genetic and neurobiological substrates between ASD and other psychiatric
  conditions (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, intellectual disability) increase susceptibility
  to multiple disorders'
- 'Step 4: Environmental stressors including social challenges, sensory overload,
  and difficulties with daily functioning compound biological vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 5: This results in significantly elevated rates of psychiatric comorbidity
  including ADHD (26.2%), intellectual disability (22.9%), sleep disorders (19.7%),
  and anxiety disorders (11.1%)'

description: Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder demonstrate substantially
  elevated rates of psychiatric comorbidity across multiple disorder categories. Population-based
  meta-analysis of 39 studies found prevalence estimates of 26.2% for ADHD, 22.9%
  for intellectual disability, 19.7% for sleep disorders, 11.1% for anxiety disorders,
  7% for disruptive disorders, 2.7% for depression, 2% for bipolar disorders, 1.8%
  for OCD, and 0.6% for psychosis. These associations reflect shared neurobiological
  substrates and genetic factors, though rates are notably lower in population-based
  samples than clinical samples.
