description: Alcohol use disorder causes dysregulation of DNA methylation through disruption of one carbon
  metabolism, which provides methyl groups for epigenetic modifications. This altered methylation generally
  represses gene transcription and contributes to AUD pathophysiology.
moderators:
- name: Chronicity of alcohol exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Chronic alcohol consumption produces more sustained epigenetic modifications compared to
    acute exposure
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism is biological, structural factors influence AUD development
    including alcohol availability, marketing exposure, economic stress, and lack of treatment access.
    The biological pathway shows how structural determinants translate into epigenetic changes that perpetuate
    disorder.
