direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Selective atrophy of fast-contracting (MyHC II/IIA) fibers reduces muscle fiber cross-sectional
  area'
- 'Step 2: Shift in MyHC protein expression toward slow-contracting (MyHC I) isoforms occurs'
- 'Step 3: Slow-contracting fibers produce lower force compared to fast-contracting fibers'
- 'Step 4: Overall muscle force production, contraction velocity, and power output decline'
- 'Step 5: These changes manifest as sarcopenia - age-related loss of muscle mass and function'

description: Fast-twitch muscle fiber atrophy leads to a predominance of slow-contracting, lower force-producing
  muscle fibers in older adults, which mechanistically explains age-related losses in whole muscle force,
  velocity, and power characteristic of sarcopenia.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this is a biological mechanism, the paper suggests that exercise or pharmacological
    interventions could shift MyHC expression toward faster isoforms and/or increase fast-contracting
    fiber size, potentially decreasing sarcopenia prevalence. This implies that structural access to exercise
    programs for older adults and healthcare access for pharmacological interventions are important policy
    levers.
