description: Shared neurogenetic architecture between sensation seeking and alcohol consumption is characterized
  by overlapping enrichment of genes expressed in midbrain and striatal tissues and variants associated
  with increased cortical surface area. This suggests that genetic factors influencing brain structure
  and reward circuitry underlie the phenotypic association between sensation seeking and alcohol consumption.

  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies biological/genetic pathways rather than individual blame.
    Understanding shared genetic architecture can inform prevention strategies targeting neurobiological
    vulnerability in high-risk populations. Structural interventions could focus on environments that
    moderate expression of genetic risk.
