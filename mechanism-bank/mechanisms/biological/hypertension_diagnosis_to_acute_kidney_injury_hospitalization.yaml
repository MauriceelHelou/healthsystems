direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic arterial hypertension causes sustained elevated pressure in renal
  vasculature, leading to progressive nephrosclerosis and reduced renal functional
  reserve'
- 'Step 2: Hypertension-induced vascular damage impairs renal autoregulation, making
  kidneys more vulnerable to hemodynamic insults during acute illness'
- 'Step 3: In the context of acute illness (e.g., COVID-19), pre-existing hypertensive
  kidney damage combined with systemic inflammation, hypoxia, and hemodynamic instability
  precipitates acute kidney injury requiring hospitalization'
- 'Step 4: Reduced baseline glomerular filtration rate and impaired tubular function
  in hypertensive patients lower the threshold for clinically significant AKI development'

description: Meta-regression analysis of 39 studies (n=25,566 patients) demonstrated
  that arterial hypertension was significantly associated with acute kidney injury
  occurrence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001). The overall pooled AKI
  incidence was 15.4%, with hypertension identified as an independent predictor. This
  relationship reflects chronic hypertensive nephropathy reducing renal reserve and
  increasing vulnerability to acute insults.
