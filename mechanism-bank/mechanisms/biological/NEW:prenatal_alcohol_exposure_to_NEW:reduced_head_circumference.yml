mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy leads to ethanol crossing the placental barrier'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol interferes with fetal cell proliferation and neuronal migration'
- 'Step 3: Dose-response relationship produces graded effects on brain growth'
- 'Step 4: Reduced neural tissue volume manifests as smaller head circumference at birth and beyond'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural factors including alcohol availability, marketing
    to women, lack of prenatal screening and intervention services, and socioeconomic conditions that
    influence drinking patterns during pregnancy. Individual blame should be avoided as alcohol use during
    pregnancy often reflects addiction, lack of awareness, or inadequate healthcare access. Equity implications
    include differential access to prenatal care and substance use treatment services.
