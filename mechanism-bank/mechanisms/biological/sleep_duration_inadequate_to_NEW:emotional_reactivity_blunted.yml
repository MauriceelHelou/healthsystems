category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep loss disrupts normal consolidation of emotional memories and regulatory processes during
  sleep'
- 'Step 2: Alterations in prefrontal-limbic connectivity reduce capacity for nuanced emotional responses'
- 'Step 3: Subjective arousal in response to emotional stimuli becomes blunted'
- 'Step 4: Reduced emotional reactivity may impair social functioning and motivation'

description: Sleep loss blunts subjective arousal in response to emotional stimuli, with standardized
  mean differences ranging from -0.20 to -0.53. This suggests sleep deprivation impairs the capacity for
  appropriate emotional responsiveness.

  equity_implications: Blunted emotional reactivity from chronic sleep loss may contribute to difficulties
    in social relationships, workplace performance, and self-care behaviors. Those in structural circumstances
    requiring sleep sacrifice (caregivers, shift workers, those with housing instability) face compounding
    disadvantages.
