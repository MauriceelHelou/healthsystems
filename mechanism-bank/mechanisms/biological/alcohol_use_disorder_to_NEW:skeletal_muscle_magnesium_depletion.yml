direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use leads to systemic magnesium depletion'
- 'Step 2: Skeletal muscle, which serves as the major magnesium reservoir in the body, releases magnesium
  to maintain serum levels'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol use prevents adequate repletion of muscle magnesium stores'
- 'Step 4: Intracellular magnesium content in skeletal muscle becomes reduced'

description: The meta-analysis found that skeletal muscle magnesium content is reduced in chronic alcohol-use
  disorder. This represents depletion of the body's major magnesium reservoir, indicating severe and systemic
  magnesium deficiency beyond what circulating levels alone would suggest.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Skeletal muscle magnesium depletion can contribute to muscle weakness, cramps,
    and functional impairment. For individuals with alcohol use disorder who may already face employment
    barriers, housing instability, and limited healthcare access, these physical symptoms can compound
    social marginalization. Structural factors that drive chronic alcohol use—economic precarity, adverse
    childhood experiences, inadequate mental health services—are thus connected to this downstream physiological
    harm.
