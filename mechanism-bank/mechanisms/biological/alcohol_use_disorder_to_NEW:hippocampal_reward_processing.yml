- 'Step 2: The hippocampus is critical for contextual memory and associating environments with reward
  expectations'
- 'Step 3: Decreased hippocampal activation during reward anticipation may impair the ability to form
  adaptive associations with non-drug rewards'
- 'Step 4: This dysfunction may contribute to impaired goal-oriented behavior and continued prioritization
  of alcohol-related rewards'

description: AUD is associated with decreased hippocampal activation during monetary reward anticipation,
  potentially reflecting impaired contextual reward memory formation that may perpetuate substance use.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism illustrates how AUD affects memory-related brain circuits, impairing
    the ability to form and retrieve adaptive reward associations. This neurobiological change is a consequence
    of the disorder rather than a character flaw.
