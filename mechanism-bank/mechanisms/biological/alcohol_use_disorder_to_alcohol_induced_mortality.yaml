direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to chronic, heavy alcohol consumption patterns
  that exceed safe thresholds'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged excessive alcohol intake causes cumulative organ damage including
  hepatotoxicity (liver cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis), cardiotoxicity, and neurotoxicity'
- 'Step 3: AUD impairs behavioral regulation and increases risk of acute alcohol poisoning,
  withdrawal complications, and accidents'
- 'Step 4: Progressive multi-organ dysfunction and acute alcohol-related events directly
  contribute to mortality from 100% alcohol-attributable causes'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis establishes an exponential positive
  relationship between alcohol use disorder and alcohol-induced mortality. The mortality
  rate in AUD patients was 3.13 per 1000 person-years. Higher levels of alcohol consumption
  associated with AUD dramatically increase mortality risk in a dose-response manner,
  with four standard drinks daily conferring approximately 4-fold increased risk of
  dying from AUD compared to non-drinkers.

  description: Risk relationship is exponential - at 4 standard drinks per day, mortality
    risk is 4-fold higher (RR=3.94) compared to non-drinkers; even at 20g/day (~1
    large beer), AUD mortality risk is approximately double
