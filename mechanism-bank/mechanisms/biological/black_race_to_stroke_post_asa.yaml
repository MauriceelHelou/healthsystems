mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Among patients receiving alcohol septal ablation, stroke risk shows no
  statistically significant difference between Black and White patients'
- 'Step 2: The slightly elevated but non-significant point estimate (RR=1.29) may
  reflect residual confounding from delayed access to care or comorbidity burden'
- 'Step 3: Overall, the lack of significant difference reinforces that treatment efficacy
  and safety do not vary by race when access is achieved'
