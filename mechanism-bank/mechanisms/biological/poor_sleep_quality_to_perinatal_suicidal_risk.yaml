mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor sleep quality during pregnancy and postpartum disrupts restorative
  sleep processes necessary for emotional and cognitive regulation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic sleep quality deficits lead to accumulation of neurobiological
  stress markers and inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 3: Compromised cognitive-emotional processing increases vulnerability to suicidal
  ideation'
- 'Step 4: Effects compound with perinatal-specific physiological and psychosocial
  stressors'
