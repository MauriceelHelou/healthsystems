mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Overweight/obese status (BMI ≥25) creates metabolic environment with insulin resistance'
- 'Step 2: Moderate alcohol consumption in this context may improve insulin sensitivity'
- 'Step 3: Interaction between adiposity and alcohol metabolism creates conditions for protective effect'
- 'Step 4: Normal weight individuals lack this metabolic substrate for alcohol''s protective mechanism'

description: BMI acts as an effect modifier in the alcohol-diabetes relationship. The protective association
  of moderate alcohol consumption was only observed in overweight and obese women, suggesting that the
  metabolic context of excess adiposity is necessary for the protective mechanism to operate.

  description: Effect modification by BMI was observed specifically in women
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Obesity itself is a structurally determined condition, shaped by food environments,
    built environments, economic resources, and social conditions. The finding that BMI modifies alcohol's
    effect on diabetes risk highlights the complex interplay between multiple structural determinants
    of health. Communities facing obesogenic environments due to food deserts, lack of safe spaces for
    physical activity, and economic constraints experience compounded health risks. This interaction effect
    should not be interpreted as recommending alcohol for overweight individuals, but rather illustrates
    how structural conditions create different biological contexts for health exposures.
