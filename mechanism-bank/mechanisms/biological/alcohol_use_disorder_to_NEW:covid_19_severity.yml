description: This meta-analysis of 40 studies with nearly 1.7 million COVID-19 individuals demonstrates
  that alcohol consumption significantly increases COVID-19 severity. Individuals with drinking history
  had 23% higher risk of severe COVID-19 and 32% higher risk of ICU admission. The mechanism operates
  through alcohol's immunosuppressive effects on pulmonary and systemic immune defenses.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This mechanism has important structural dimensions: alcohol availability policies,
    marketing regulations, and socioeconomic factors that influence drinking patterns are modifiable structural
    determinants. Communities with higher alcohol outlet density and fewer alcohol control policies may
    face disproportionate COVID-19 severity burden. The finding challenges misinformation that alcohol
    could protect against COVID-19, which may have been more prevalent in communities with less health
    information access.'
