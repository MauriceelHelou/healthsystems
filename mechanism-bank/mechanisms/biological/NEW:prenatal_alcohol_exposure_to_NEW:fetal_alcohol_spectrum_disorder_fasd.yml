direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy exposes developing fetus to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol crosses placental barrier and disrupts fetal neurodevelopment'
- 'Step 3: Neurodevelopmental damage occurs in areas governing cognition, memory, language, executive
  functioning, and emotional regulation'
- 'Step 4: Severity of deficits depends on quantity and timing of alcohol exposure during prenatal development
  period'
- 'Step 5: Results in range of lifelong neurodevelopmental deficits characteristic of FASD'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, which may
    be influenced by structural factors such as lack of access to prenatal care, substance use treatment,
    social support, and economic stressors, leads to lifelong neurodevelopmental disabilities in offspring.
    Equity implications include that populations with reduced access to healthcare and higher rates of
    alcohol use disorder may face disproportionate burden of FASD.
