category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cognitive frailty represents the co-occurrence of physical frailty and
  mild cognitive impairment, creating a synergistic vulnerability state in older adults'
- 'Step 2: Physical frailty components (weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low activity,
  weight loss) directly impair capacity for performing activities of daily living'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive impairment compromises executive function, planning, sequencing,
  and memory required for complex ADL tasks'
- 'Step 4: The combined physical-cognitive burden creates multiplicative effects on
  functional capacity, as cognitive deficits impair compensatory strategies for physical
  limitations'
- 'Step 5: Progressive decline in both domains leads to accelerated disability and
  loss of independence in basic and instrumental ADLs'

description: 'Cognitive frailty, the combination of physical frailty and mild cognitive
  impairment, dramatically increases the risk of disability and functional decline.
  This meta-analysis of 22 cohort studies found that cognitive frailty was associated
  with an 11-fold increased risk of disability compared to robust older adults (RR
  = 11.32, 95% CI: 4.14-30.97). This effect is substantially larger than physical
  frailty alone (RR = 5.91 for disability), indicating synergistic effects between
  physical and cognitive decline on functional outcomes.'
