direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic periodontitis creates persistent bacterial infection and inflammation
  in oral tissues, releasing inflammatory mediators (cytokines, prostaglandins) into
  systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Systemic inflammation from periodontal disease increases insulin resistance
  through inflammatory pathways involving TNF-α, IL-6, and C-reactive protein'
- 'Step 3: Increased insulin resistance impairs glucose uptake by cells and reduces
  the effectiveness of endogenous and exogenous insulin'
- 'Step 4: Poor insulin sensitivity leads to elevated blood glucose levels and higher
  HbA1c percentages, indicating worsened glycemic control'
- 'Step 5: Evidence from periodontal treatment studies demonstrates that reducing
  periodontal inflammation improves HbA1c levels, confirming the causal pathway'

description: Chronic periodontitis negatively impacts diabetes control (HbA1c) through
  systemic inflammation and increased insulin resistance. A Bayesian network meta-analysis
  of 14 RCTs demonstrated that periodontal treatment (scaling and root planing) significantly
  improved HbA1c levels compared to no treatment, with mean reductions of 0.4-1.1%
  depending on treatment type. This bidirectional relationship shows that oral inflammation
  contributes to glycemic dysregulation in diabetic patients.
