direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Malnutrition in older adults leads to deficiencies in essential nutrients
  including B vitamins, amino acids, and micronutrients critical for neurotransmitter
  synthesis and brain function'
- 'Step 2: Protein-energy malnutrition compromises immune function and increases systemic
  inflammation, elevating pro-inflammatory cytokines that can cross the blood-brain
  barrier'
- 'Step 3: Nutritional deficits impair the brain''s metabolic reserve and capacity
  to maintain homeostasis during the physiological stress of surgery'
- 'Step 4: The combination of surgical stress, anesthesia, and diminished neurological
  resilience due to malnutrition precipitates acute brain dysfunction manifesting
  as postoperative delirium'

description: Malnutrition in older adults significantly increases the risk of postoperative
  delirium following hip fracture surgery. A meta-analysis of 14 studies found that
  malnourished older patients had 275% increased odds of developing delirium (OR =
  2.75, 95% CI 1.80-4.18). The mechanism involves nutritional deficiencies impairing
  neurotransmitter synthesis, increasing systemic inflammation, and reducing the brain's
  metabolic reserve to cope with surgical stress.
