description: Systematic review found lack of evidence from PAE studies to support inclusion of non-sentinel
  dysmorphic features in FASD diagnostic criteria
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Evidence gaps for certain diagnostic features have implications for equitable diagnosis.
    Over-reliance on features with weak evidence could lead to misdiagnosis, while appropriate evidence-based
    criteria improve diagnostic accuracy across populations.
