mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol misuse causes brain damage and accelerates aging'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive impairments develop including memory deficits'
- 'Step 3: Dementia risk increases (though mechanism differs from Alzheimer''s pathology)'
- 'Step 4: Increased dementia burden contributes to mortality (note: alcohol increases dementia risk but
  not necessarily Alzheimer''s disease specifically)'

description: 'The review concludes that while alcohol misuse increases dementia risk, it does not necessarily
  increase Alzheimer''s disease risk specifically. Key distinctions include: (1) reversibility of alcohol-related
  brain damage with abstinence vs. progressive Alzheimer''s course, and (2) absence of characteristic
  protein inclusions (amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles) in AUD-affected brains that are hallmarks of Alzheimer''s
  pathology.'

  description: Characteristic protein inclusions present in Alzheimer's brains are absent in AUD brains,
    suggesting distinct pathological mechanisms despite shared cognitive outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This nuanced finding has important implications for public health messaging and
    intervention design. Structural approaches to reducing alcohol-related dementia should focus on treatment
    access and harm reduction, recognizing that unlike Alzheimer's, alcohol-related cognitive decline
    may be reversible. The distinction matters for healthcare resource allocation and policy priorities.
