category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use disorder leads to altered insula function'
- 'Step 2: The insula plays a critical role in interoceptive awareness and integrating bodily states with
  decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Decreased insula activation during reward anticipation and outcome reflects impaired integration
  of reward-related bodily signals'
- 'Step 4: This dysfunction may contribute to poor decision-making and continued substance use despite
  negative consequences'

description: AUD patients show decreased insula activation during both reward anticipation and outcome
  stages, indicating impaired interoceptive processing that may undermine adaptive decision-making and
  goal-oriented behavior.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Insula dysfunction in AUD represents a neurobiological change that impairs the
    brain's ability to integrate bodily signals with reward processing. This provides biological evidence
    for why individuals with AUD may struggle with decisions about drinking despite awareness of consequences.
