direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection establishes persistent viral
  replication in hepatocytes, causing ongoing hepatocellular injury and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Sustained hepatic inflammation triggers activation of hepatic stellate
  cells and progressive fibrogenesis, leading to accumulation of extracellular matrix
  proteins'
- 'Step 3: Progressive fibrosis advances through stages (F0-F4), ultimately resulting
  in cirrhosis with distortion of hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative
  nodules'
- 'Step 4: Compensated cirrhosis transitions to decompensated cirrhosis when portal
  hypertension and synthetic dysfunction manifest as ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic
  encephalopathy, or jaundice'
- 'Step 5: Co-occurring factors such as alcohol use disorders substantially accelerate
  disease progression, with AUD increasing risk of decompensation by 3.3-fold in HCV-infected
  individuals'

description: Chronic Hepatitis C virus infection drives progressive liver disease
  through sustained hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. The natural
  history of untreated HCV infection involves progression through fibrosis stages
  to cirrhosis, with eventual decompensation manifesting as ascites, variceal hemorrhage,
  encephalopathy, and liver failure. This systematic review of 11 studies (n=286,641
  HCV-infected individuals) demonstrates that co-occurring alcohol use disorders dramatically
  accelerate this progression, with a 3.3-fold increased risk of decompensated cirrhosis.
  Approximately 35% of decompensated cirrhosis cases in this population are attributable
  to concurrent AUD, highlighting the synergistic hepatotoxicity of viral and alcohol-related
  liver injury.
