mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with high-risk drinking behavior receive personalized advice based
  on their liver biomarker results (including GGT levels) or non-invasive fibrosis
  tests during clinical encounters'
- 'Step 2: Presentation of objective biomarker evidence of liver injury increases
  patient awareness and motivation for behavior change through enhanced understanding
  of personal health consequences'
- 'Step 3: Motivated patients reduce alcohol consumption (mean reduction of 74.4 g/week
  compared to controls)'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol intake decreases hepatocellular stress and enzyme induction
  in the liver'
- 'Step 5: Lower hepatic stress results in decreased GGT synthesis and release from
  hepatocytes, leading to measurable reductions in serum GGT levels'

description: 'Biomarker-based liver advice reduces GGT levels through a behavioral
  pathway: personalized feedback about liver injury biomarkers motivates patients
  to reduce alcohol consumption, which in turn reduces hepatic stress and decreases
  GGT enzyme production and release. Meta-analysis of 14 RCTs and 2 observational
  studies demonstrated a mean reduction of 19.7 IU/L in GGT levels in intervention
  groups compared to controls.'
