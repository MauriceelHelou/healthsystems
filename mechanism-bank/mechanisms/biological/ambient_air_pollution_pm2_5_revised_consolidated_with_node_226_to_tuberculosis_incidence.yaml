direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM2.5 particles deposits fine particulate matter deep into
  the lower respiratory tract and alveoli due to their small size (≤2.5 micrometers)'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 exposure causes oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in pulmonary
  tissue, impairing local immune defenses including alveolar macrophage function'
- 'Step 3: Compromised pulmonary immune function reduces the ability to contain Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis infection, either increasing susceptibility to new infection or promoting
  reactivation of latent tuberculosis'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation and epithelial damage from sustained PM2.5 exposure
  creates a permissive environment for bacterial proliferation and disease progression
  to active pulmonary tuberculosis'

description: 'This meta-analysis of 6 studies examining PM2.5 and pulmonary tuberculosis
  incidence found that for every 10 μg/m³ increment in PM2.5 concentration, there
  was a 12% increase in PTB incidence (aRR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.06-1.19). The biological
  mechanism involves PM2.5-induced pulmonary inflammation, oxidative stress, and impairment
  of alveolar macrophage function, which collectively compromise the lung''s ability
  to defend against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. No association was found
  between PM2.5 and TB-related mortality or hospital admissions.'
