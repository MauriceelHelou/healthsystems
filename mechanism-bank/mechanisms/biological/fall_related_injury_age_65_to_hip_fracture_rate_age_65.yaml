direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Falls in older adults result in direct traumatic impact to the body, with
  the hip region being particularly vulnerable during lateral or sideways falls'
- 'Step 2: Age-related bone loss (osteoporosis) reduces bone mineral density and structural
  integrity in the proximal femur, making the hip susceptible to fracture under fall-related
  impact forces'
- 'Step 3: The combination of fall-induced trauma and compromised bone strength leads
  to hip fractures, which represent one of the most serious injurious outcomes of
  falls in older adults'

description: Falls are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults,
  with hip fractures representing one of the most serious outcomes of injurious falls.
  The protocol identifies fractures as a key secondary outcome measure in falls prevention
  research, acknowledging the direct causal pathway between fall-related injuries
  and hip fractures in the elderly population.
