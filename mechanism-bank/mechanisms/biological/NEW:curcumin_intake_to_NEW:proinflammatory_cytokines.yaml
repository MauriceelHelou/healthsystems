direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Curcumin is absorbed and distributed to tissues including the liver, where
  it exerts its bioactive effects'
- 'Step 2: Curcumin acts as a free radical scavenger via its phenolic, β-diketone,
  and methoxy groups, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced oxidative stress leads to decreased activation of inflammatory
  signaling pathways including NF-κB'
- 'Step 4: Curcumin directly suppresses production and release of proinflammatory
  cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) from immune and hepatic cells'
- 'Step 5: Additionally, curcumin inhibits PI3K/Akt pathway activation and hepatic
  stellate cell activation, further reducing inflammatory signaling'
- 'Step 6: Enhanced expression of antioxidant enzymes (Nrf2, SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx, GR)
  provides sustained anti-inflammatory protection'

description: Curcumin intake reduces proinflammatory cytokine levels through multiple
  interconnected mechanisms. The compound acts as a direct free radical scavenger
  through its phenolic and β-diketone groups, reducing oxidative stress that triggers
  inflammatory cascades. It suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting
  key signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt and NF-κB. Additionally, curcumin upregulates
  endogenous antioxidant defenses (Nrf2, SOD, CAT, GSH) which provide sustained protection
  against inflammation-inducing oxidative damage.
