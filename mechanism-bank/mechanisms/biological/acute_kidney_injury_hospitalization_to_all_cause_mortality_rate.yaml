direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute kidney injury (AKI) develops during hospitalization due to various
  insults including sepsis, nephrotoxic medications, hypoperfusion, or direct viral
  injury (e.g., SARS-CoV-2)'
- 'Step 2: AKI leads to accumulation of uremic toxins, fluid overload, electrolyte
  imbalances (hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis), and impaired drug clearance'
- 'Step 3: These metabolic derangements cause multi-organ dysfunction including cardiovascular
  complications, respiratory failure, and impaired immune function'
- 'Step 4: Severe cases require renal replacement therapy (RRT), which carries additional
  risks including hemodynamic instability and infection'
- 'Step 5: The combination of underlying disease severity, metabolic complications,
  and multi-organ involvement substantially increases mortality risk'

description: Acute kidney injury during hospitalization is strongly associated with
  increased all-cause mortality. This meta-analysis of 39 studies (n=25,566 COVID-19
  patients) found that AKI occurred in 15.4% of hospitalized patients overall and
  53% of severe cases. The odds of death were 15.4 times higher in patients who developed
  AKI compared to survivors. The mechanism involves metabolic derangements, multi-organ
  dysfunction, and the need for renal replacement therapy in 4.3% of patients.
