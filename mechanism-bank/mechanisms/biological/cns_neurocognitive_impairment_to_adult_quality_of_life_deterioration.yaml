category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adolescent cannabis-induced neurocognitive changes range from transient
  mood alterations to permanent impairments in cognitive function and sensory processing'
- 'Step 2: Permanent cognitive function impairments persist into adulthood, affecting
  executive function, memory, and information processing'
- 'Step 3: Cognitive and sensory processing deficits limit educational attainment,
  occupational performance, and social functioning'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative functional limitations across multiple life domains result in
  deteriorated quality of life in adulthood'
