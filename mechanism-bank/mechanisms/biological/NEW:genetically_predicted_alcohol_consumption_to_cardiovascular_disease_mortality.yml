mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants (e.g., ADH1B, ALDH2) influence alcohol metabolism and consumption patterns'
- 'Step 2: Mendelian randomization uses these variants as instrumental variables to assess causal effects'
- 'Step 3: Systematic review finds null associations (67% of studies) for genetically predicted alcohol
  and cardiovascular disease'
- 'Step 4: One study on all-cause mortality reported detrimental association with alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Heterogeneity in methodology limits definitive causal conclusions'

description: Systematic review of 24 Mendelian randomization studies examining causal relationship between
  genetically predicted alcohol consumption and cardiometabolic outcomes. Majority (67%) of studies found
  null associations for cardiovascular disease, 75% null for diabetes. Single study on all-cause mortality
  found detrimental effect. Methodological heterogeneity limits definitive conclusions.

    more reliable estimates

  description: Only 21% of studies assessed potential non-linear relationships; J-shaped associations
    may be missed with linear methods
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: 'This MR approach attempts to address confounding that plagues observational studies
    of alcohol and health. The null findings challenge the ''moderate drinking is protective'' narrative
    that has been used to promote alcohol consumption. Structural factors like alcohol marketing, pricing
    policies, and outlet density shape population-level consumption patterns that may have different effects
    than individual genetic predisposition. Equity implications: alcohol-related harms disproportionately
    affect lower socioeconomic groups even at similar consumption levels due to differential access to
    healthcare and social support.'
