direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Impulsivity is associated with altered prefrontal cortex function and reduced
  executive control, which are shared neural substrates with serious mental illnesses'
- 'Step 2: Impulsive behavior patterns may exacerbate symptoms and reduce treatment
  adherence in individuals with mental disorders'
- 'Step 3: The bidirectional relationship between impulsivity and mental disorders
  is evidenced by the prevalence of impulsivity as a transdiagnostic feature across
  multiple serious mental illnesses including substance use disorders, ADHD, and bipolar
  disorder'

description: This meta-analysis demonstrates that impulsivity is a core feature across
  multiple serious mental illnesses, with 18 RCTs examining brain stimulation interventions
  targeting impulsivity in psychiatric populations. The study confirms the biological
  link between prefrontal cortex function, impulsivity, and mental disorders. While
  the evidence for treatment efficacy is mixed, the consistent presence of impulsivity
  across mental disorder populations supports the positive association between impulsivity
  and serious mental illness.
