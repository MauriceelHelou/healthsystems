description: Alcohol consumption is associated with increased liver cirrhosis mortality, with females
  showing higher vulnerability than males at equivalent consumption levels. The study found that additional
  analyses confirmed the sex-specific pattern for mortality outcomes specifically.

  description: Females showed higher risk for both morbidity and mortality from liver cirrhosis compared

  equity_implications: Mortality disparities from alcohol-related liver disease reflect intersecting structural
    factors including access to hepatology care, liver transplant equity, healthcare system navigation
    barriers, insurance coverage, and socioeconomic factors affecting early detection and treatment. Sex-based
    differences in mortality risk require sex-specific prevention guidelines and treatment protocols.
