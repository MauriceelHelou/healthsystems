direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sodium (Na+) is added to alcoholic beer formulation'
- 'Step 2: Sodium promotes fluid retention by maintaining plasma osmolality'
- 'Step 3: Reduced urinary fluid losses compared to standard beer'
- 'Step 4: Improved rehydration status despite alcohol content'

description: Adding sodium to alcoholic beer may improve post-exercise rehydration by decreasing fluid
  losses, though palatability concerns may limit practical application.

  equity_implications: This finding relates to product formulation and food/beverage regulation. Policies
    around functional beverages and health claims for alcoholic products intersect with public health
    considerations.
