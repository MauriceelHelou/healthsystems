direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the presence of ethanol in the bloodstream
  over extended periods'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol reacts with phosphatidylcholine in red blood cell membranes via
  phospholipase D enzyme activity, producing phosphatidylethanol (PEth) as a direct
  metabolite'
- 'Step 3: PEth accumulates in blood due to its long half-life (approximately 4-12
  days), with concentrations proportional to alcohol intake patterns'
- 'Step 4: Higher PEth blood concentrations serve as a direct biomarker indicating
  chronic excessive alcohol consumption, distinguishing heavy drinkers (>60 g/day)
  from social drinkers'

description: Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is a direct marker of chronic alcohol use
  formed when ethanol is incorporated into phospholipids in red blood cell membranes.
  Meta-analysis of 12 studies demonstrates that PEth blood levels effectively distinguish
  heavy drinkers from social drinkers, with heavy drinkers showing approximately 13.5-fold
  higher mean concentrations (3.897 μM vs 0.288 μM). The marker demonstrates good
  clinical efficiency for detecting chronic heavy drinking patterns.
