direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD affects early sensory processing of reward-related cues'
- 'Step 2: Decreased activation in visual areas (inferior occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus)
  during reward anticipation'
- 'Step 3: Reduced sensory cortex engagement may reflect diminished salience or attention to non-drug
  reward cues'
- 'Step 4: This attentional/perceptual deficit may contribute to reduced motivation for natural rewards'

description: AUD patients display decreased activation in sensory processing areas during monetary reward
  anticipation, suggesting reduced perceptual salience of non-drug reward cues.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Sensory processing deficits in AUD extend beyond classic reward circuits, indicating
    widespread neural changes that affect how individuals perceive and attend to natural reward cues in
    their environment.
