- 'Step 1: ARDS develops as a complication in critically ill patients due to underlying conditions such
  as sepsis or trauma'
- 'Step 2: ARDS causes severe hypoxemic respiratory failure through diffuse alveolar damage and pulmonary
  edema'
- 'Step 3: Impaired gas exchange leads to systemic hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Increased inflammatory response and ventilator-induced lung injury compound physiological stress'
- 'Step 5: These cascading effects directly increase mortality risk independent of underlying conditions'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis establishes a direct causal link between ARDS and
  mortality in critically ill patients. Using both traditional meta-analysis of 44 observational studies
  and novel causal inference methods (targeted minimum loss-based estimation), the study demonstrates
  that ARDS independently increases mortality beyond what is attributable to underlying conditions like
  sepsis or trauma.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While ARDS itself is a clinical syndrome, structural factors influence who develops
    critical illness and ARDS. Access to critical care, ICU capacity, healthcare system resources, and
    social determinants influence both risk of developing ARDS-predisposing conditions (sepsis, trauma)
    and survival outcomes. Health systems with inadequate ICU infrastructure or delayed care access may
    see higher ARDS-related mortality. The finding justifies investment in ARDS prevention research, which
    has equity implications for resource allocation in healthcare systems.
