mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vitamin D supplementation increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels'
- 'Step 2: Adequate vitamin D status supports immune function, bone health, and cellular regulation'
- 'Step 3: Improved vitamin D status may reduce risk of infections, cancer progression, and metabolic
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative reduction in multiple disease pathways leads to decreased all-cause mortality risk'

description: Meta-analysis of 80 RCTs including 163,131 participants (82,210 receiving vitamin D, 80,921
  placebo/no treatment) found vitamin D supplementation associated with 5% reduced odds of all-cause mortality.
  Mean age was 66.1 years with 68.6% female participants. The protective effect was more pronounced in
  higher quality studies.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While vitamin D supplementation is an individual-level intervention, access to
    supplementation and optimal vitamin D status are influenced by structural factors including food fortification
    policies, healthcare access for deficiency screening, socioeconomic ability to purchase supplements,
    and environmental factors affecting sun exposure (housing quality, occupational conditions, urban
    design). Populations with limited healthcare access or living in food deserts may have higher rates
    of vitamin D deficiency.
