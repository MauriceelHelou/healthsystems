description: Prenatal alcohol exposure suppresses glucocorticoid receptor expression through epigenetic
  mechanisms, impairing the body's ability to regulate stress responses. This contributes to long-term
  HPA axis dysfunction in offspring.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Glucocorticoid receptor suppression represents a molecular mechanism through which
    structural factors (alcohol availability, lack of prenatal support services, economic stress driving
    alcohol use) become biologically embedded and transmitted across generations.
