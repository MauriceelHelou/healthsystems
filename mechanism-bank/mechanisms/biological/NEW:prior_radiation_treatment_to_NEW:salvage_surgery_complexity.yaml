direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior radiation therapy to head and neck tissues causes cumulative damage
  including fibrosis, vascular compromise, and altered tissue planes'
- 'Step 2: Irradiated tissue fields develop reduced vascularity, impaired wound healing
  capacity, and loss of normal anatomical landmarks'
- 'Step 3: Salvage surgery in previously irradiated fields faces increased technical
  complexity due to tissue friability, scarring, and distorted anatomy'
- 'Step 4: Surgical complications increase including positive margin rates (19.4%),
  higher complication rates (32.3%), and need for temporary tracheostomy and nasogastric
  tube support'
- 'Step 5: Outcomes are compromised compared to primary surgery, with reduced overall
  survival (RR 0.35) and disease-free survival (RR 0.44) rates'

description: Prior radiation therapy to head and neck significantly increases the
  technical complexity and risk of salvage surgery. This systematic review of 15 studies
  (515 patients) demonstrates that surgery in previously irradiated fields results
  in substantially worse outcomes compared to primary cancer surgery, with risk ratios
  of 0.35 for overall survival and 0.44 for disease-free survival. Positive surgical
  margins occur in 19.4% of cases, complication rates reach 32.3%, and patients frequently
  require temporary tracheostomy (mean decannulation 9.7 days) and nasogastric tube
  support (mean 12.8 days). Long-term tracheostomy dependence occurs in up to 11.5%
  of patients. These findings reflect the biological impact of radiation-induced tissue
  damage including fibrosis, vascular compromise, and altered tissue planes that complicate
  surgical intervention.
