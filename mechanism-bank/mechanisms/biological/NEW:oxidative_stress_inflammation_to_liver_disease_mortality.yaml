mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oxidative stress creates a lipotoxic hepatic environment with accumulation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation products in liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation and oxidative damage trigger hepatocyte injury, leading
  to progression from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)'
- 'Step 3: Persistent oxidative stress and inflammation promote hepatic stellate cell
  activation and extracellular matrix deposition, resulting in progressive fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Continued oxidative damage causes epigenetic modifications, gene mutations,
  and gut dysbiosis that accelerate disease progression to cirrhosis'
- 'Step 5: Advanced liver damage from cirrhosis increases risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
  and liver failure, leading to increased liver disease mortality'

description: 'Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation create a lipotoxic environment
  in the liver that drives progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
  through a spectrum of increasing severity: steatosis, steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis,
  cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma. This pathological cascade involves
  hepatocyte injury, immune dysregulation, epigenetic modifications, gene mutations,
  and gut dysbiosis, ultimately increasing liver disease mortality.'
