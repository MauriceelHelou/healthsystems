  description: 'Protective effect of parity diminishes in younger cohorts. 1950s cohort:
    HR 0.86 (0.66-1.13, non-significant) vs. older cohorts: 1940s HR 0.60 (0.49-0.73),
    1930s HR 0.46 (0.38-0.56), 1920s HR 0.62 (0.51-0.77). The protective effect is
    strongest in the 1930s cohort and weakest (non-significant) in the 1950s cohort.'
