category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lichen sclerosus causes chronic inflammation of genital skin and mucosal
  tissues, predominantly affecting the anogenital region (77% of female cases, 99%
  of male cases localize to genitals)'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory processes lead to progressive tissue changes including loss
  of normal genital architecture (14% in women, 34% in men), textural changes, atrophy,
  and scarring'
- 'Step 3: Architectural alterations result in narrowing or stenosis of vaginal introitus
  in women and phimosis/urethral changes in men'
- 'Step 4: Tissue fragility from atrophy leads to erosions, ulcerations, and fissuring
  during sexual activity'
- 'Step 5: These structural and tissue changes cause pain during intercourse (dyspareunia)
  and broader sexual dysfunction, documented as a recognized complication of lichen
  sclerosus'

description: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that predominantly
  affects genital tissues, causing progressive architectural changes, atrophy, and
  tissue fragility. These pathological changes directly contribute to sexual dysfunction
  and dyspareunia, which are recognized complications of the disease. The systematic
  review of 900 studies documented sexual dysfunction including dyspareunia as an
  established complication among 2,795 complications in women and 769 in men.
