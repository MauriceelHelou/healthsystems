direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Food insecurity leads to consumption of inexpensive, energy-dense, nutrient-poor
  foods high in refined carbohydrates, sodium, and saturated fats due to financial
  constraints'
- 'Step 2: Poor dietary quality contributes to metabolic dysregulation including obesity
  (especially in women), insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia'
- 'Step 3: Chronic metabolic stress leads to development of intermediate conditions
  including hypertension, diabetes with poor glycemic control, and systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Persistent cardiometabolic risk factors result in clinical manifestations
  including coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, and chronic
  kidney disease'

description: Food insecurity demonstrates robust associations with cardiometabolic
  conditions in adults, including hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease,
  congestive heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The biological pathway
  involves dietary quality deterioration under financial constraint, leading to metabolic
  dysregulation and cumulative cardiovascular damage. Evidence from 50 studies across
  observational, longitudinal, and interventional designs consistently supports this
  relationship.
