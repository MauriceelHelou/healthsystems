mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Type 2 diabetes causes persistent hyperglycemia and dysregulated glucose homeostasis'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood glucose increases circulating hexose (glucose and related sugars) concentrations'
- 'Step 3: Mendelian randomization confirms reverse causation: diabetes causes hexose elevation, not vice
  versa'
- 'Step 4: Sum of hexoses serves as a biomarker consequence rather than cause of diabetes'

description: Causal inference using genetic variants demonstrates that the sum of hexoses is causally
  downstream of type 2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes-to-metabolite direction), distinguishing this from metabolites
  that causally contribute to diabetes development.

  equity_implications: Understanding causal direction is critical for intervention design. This finding
    suggests hexose elevation is a consequence of diabetes rather than a modifiable upstream cause, redirecting
    intervention focus to upstream structural factors affecting lipid and BCAA metabolism.
