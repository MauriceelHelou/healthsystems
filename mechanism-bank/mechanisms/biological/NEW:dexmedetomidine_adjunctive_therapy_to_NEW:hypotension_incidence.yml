direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dexmedetomidine provides central alpha-2 agonism reducing sympathetic nervous system activity'
- 'Step 2: Reduced sympathetic tone decreases peripheral vascular resistance'
- 'Step 3: Diminished vasoconstriction leads to blood pressure reduction'
- 'Step 4: Excessive blood pressure reduction manifests as hypotension requiring intervention'

description: Adjunctive dexmedetomidine therapy is associated with significantly higher incidence of hypotension
  compared to benzodiazepine therapy alone in AWS management.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The risk of hypotension with dexmedetomidine requires close hemodynamic monitoring,
    which may not be equally available across healthcare settings. Rural hospitals and under-resourced
    facilities may be less able to safely use this therapy, perpetuating treatment disparities for severe
    alcohol withdrawal.
