mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Myo-inositol administered as food supplement for PCOS'
- 'Step 2: Acts as insulin sensitizer to improve insulin signaling'
- 'Step 3: Equivalent effects on fasting insulin, HOMA index, and testosterone as metformin'
- 'Step 4: Improved androgenic and metabolic profile with better tolerability'

description: 'Meta-analysis found no significant difference between metformin and myo-inositol on fasting
  insulin (SMD=0.08, 95% CI: -0.31-0.46, p=.697), indicating equivalent short-term metabolic effects.
  Myo-inositol, as a food supplement, provides comparable efficacy with better tolerability.'

  equity_implications: Access to myo-inositol as a food supplement rather than prescription medication
    may reduce barriers related to healthcare access, prescription costs, and medical system navigation.
    This has equity implications for women in underserved areas or without adequate insurance coverage.
