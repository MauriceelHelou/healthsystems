description: Genetic mediation models provide evidence that alcohol consumption mediates the association
  between sensation seeking and AUD. This suggests that sensation seeking primarily increases AUD risk
  through its effects on consumption levels rather than through direct effects on developing problems
  and consequences. The link is indirect, operating through the consumption pathway.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mediation model suggests prevention efforts should target the consumption
    pathway connecting sensation seeking to AUD. Structural interventions reducing alcohol availability
    and marketing exposure could interrupt this pathway in populations with genetic vulnerability to sensation
    seeking. Policy approaches like alcohol taxation and outlet density restrictions become relevant prevention
    strategies.
