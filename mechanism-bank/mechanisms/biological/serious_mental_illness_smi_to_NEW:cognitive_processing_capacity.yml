description: Mental health and substance use disorders negatively impact cognitive processing capacity
  including attention, concentration, and memory, which affects daily functioning and the ability to benefit
  from therapeutic interventions including virtual reality-based treatments.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism highlights how the biological impacts of MHD/SUD create differential
    capacity to benefit from healthcare interventions. Rather than framing treatment non-response as individual
    failure, this recognizes the neurobiological basis of cognitive challenges. Equity implications: Standard
    therapeutic approaches that do not accommodate these cognitive differences may systematically disadvantage
    people with MHD/SUD, requiring structural changes to intervention design.'
