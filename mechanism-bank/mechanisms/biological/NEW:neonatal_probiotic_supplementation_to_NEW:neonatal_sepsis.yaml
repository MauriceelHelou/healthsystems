direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Probiotic supplementation introduces beneficial bacterial strains to the
  neonatal gastrointestinal tract during the critical colonization period'
- 'Step 2: Beneficial bacteria competitively exclude pathogenic organisms by occupying
  attachment sites on intestinal epithelium and competing for nutrients'
- 'Step 3: Probiotics enhance intestinal barrier function, reducing bacterial translocation
  from the gut lumen into the bloodstream'
- 'Step 4: Probiotics modulate the neonatal immune system, enhancing both innate and
  adaptive immune responses against pathogens'
- 'Step 5: Reduced pathogen colonization and improved immune function lead to decreased
  incidence of systemic bacterial infection (sepsis)'

description: Probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period reduces the risk
  of neonatal sepsis by 22% (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.86) based on high-quality evidence
  from 21 randomized controlled trials with 9,105 participants. The number needed
  to treat to prevent one case of sepsis is 14. This protective effect is observed
  primarily in preterm and low birth weight neonates in hospital settings in low-
  and middle-income countries.
