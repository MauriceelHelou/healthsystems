direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania and depression,
  with depressive episodes involving severe hopelessness, psychic pain, and suicidal
  ideation'
- 'Step 2: The cyclical nature of BD creates periods of impulsivity during manic/mixed
  states combined with profound despair during depressive phases, increasing suicide
  risk'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological dysregulation in BD affects serotonergic and dopaminergic
  systems, which are implicated in both mood regulation and suicidal behavior'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with BD experience substantially elevated risk of death by
  suicide compared to the general population'

description: Bipolar disorder is associated with a markedly elevated risk of death
  by suicide, with individuals having nearly 12 times the risk compared to the general
  population. This meta-analysis of 25 studies examining suicide mortality in BD populations
  found the highest cause-specific mortality risk was for suicide (RR = 11.69). The
  pathway involves the inherent features of bipolar disorder including severe depressive
  episodes, impulsivity during manic phases, and underlying neurobiological vulnerabilities
  that together create substantially elevated suicide risk.
