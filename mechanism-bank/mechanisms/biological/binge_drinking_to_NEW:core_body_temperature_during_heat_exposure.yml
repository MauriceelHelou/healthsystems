direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption causes peripheral vasodilation, increasing skin blood flow'
- 'Step 2: Increased cutaneous blood flow facilitates heat dissipation from the body surface'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced heat loss through the skin results in lower core body temperature during heat exposure'
- 'Step 4: This effect was observed across moderate alcohol doses (average 0.68 g/kg) in controlled heat
  environments'

description: Contrary to current heat-health public guidance, this systematic review of 8 controlled studies
  found that moderate alcohol consumption (average 0.68 g/kg) lowered core body temperature in 3 of 4
  studies measuring this outcome during heat exposure in young healthy males. This appears to occur through
  alcohol-induced peripheral vasodilation enhancing heat dissipation.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This finding challenges existing public health messaging about alcohol and heat
    risk. Current heat-health advisories warning against alcohol consumption during heat events may be
    based on limited evidence. However, the evidence base is severely limited to young healthy males with
    moderate alcohol doses and short heat exposures - populations least vulnerable to heat-related morbidity/mortality.
    Structural determinants including access to cooling, housing quality, and occupational heat exposure
    may interact with alcohol consumption in ways not captured by these controlled studies. Equity implications
    are significant as heat vulnerability is concentrated among elderly, those with chronic conditions,
    outdoor workers, and people without access to air conditioning - populations not represented in this
    evidence base.
