mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection establishes chronic infection in the
  liver, leading to persistent hepatic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation causes progressive hepatocyte damage and fibrosis
  development over years to decades'
- 'Step 3: Continued fibrosis leads to liver cirrhosis, with loss of functional liver
  tissue and hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Cirrhosis complications (portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular
  carcinoma) result in increased mortality'

description: Hepatitis C infection is a major contributor to liver cirrhosis mortality,
  accounting for a substantial portion of cirrhosis deaths alongside hepatitis B.
  In Iran, more than 60% of liver cirrhosis mortality cases at national level are
  caused by hepatitis B and C infection combined, with hepatitis B mortality rate
  being approximately four times higher than hepatitis C. The progression from HCV
  infection to mortality occurs through chronic liver inflammation, fibrosis, and
  eventual cirrhosis with life-threatening complications.
