direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking and chronic alcohol misuse lead to direct toxic effects
  on organ-specific immune cells including microglia in the brain, alveolar macrophages
  in the lungs, and Kupffer cells in the liver'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure impairs these immune cells'' abilities to regulate inflammatory
  signaling pathways and cellular metabolism'
- 'Step 3: Compromised immune cell function leads to dysregulated inflammatory responses
  and impaired tissue repair and homeostasis maintenance'
- 'Step 4: Concurrent gut barrier leakage (intestinal permeability) exacerbates immune
  cell dysfunction by exposing the system to bacterial products and endotoxins'
- 'Step 5: These effects contribute to multiorgan dysfunction and increased susceptibility
  to infections and disease'

description: Alcohol use disorder contributes to immune cell dysfunction through direct
  impairment of organ-specific immune cells including microglia, alveolar macrophages,
  and Kupffer cells. Chronic alcohol exposure and binge drinking disrupt these cells'
  abilities to regulate inflammatory signaling and metabolism, compromising host immune
  defense, tissue repair, and homeostasis maintenance across multiple organ systems.
