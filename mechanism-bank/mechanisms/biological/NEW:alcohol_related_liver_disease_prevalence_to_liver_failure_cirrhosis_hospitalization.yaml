mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to alcohol-related liver disease (ALD),
  which encompasses a spectrum of conditions including hepatic steatosis, alcoholic
  hepatitis, and fibrosis'
- 'Step 2: Progressive liver damage from ongoing ALD causes hepatocyte injury, inflammation,
  and activation of hepatic stellate cells, leading to excessive collagen deposition
  and fibrosis'
- 'Step 3: Advanced fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis, characterized by irreversible
  architectural distortion of the liver with regenerative nodules surrounded by fibrous
  bands'
- 'Step 4: Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension and hepatic decompensation, manifesting
  as complications such as ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and
  hepatorenal syndrome'
- 'Step 5: These severe complications of cirrhosis require acute medical intervention,
  resulting in hospitalization for liver failure and cirrhosis management'

description: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) represents a major pathway to liver
  cirrhosis and subsequent hospitalization. This systematic review of Asian populations
  demonstrated significant alcohol-attributable proportions of liver cirrhosis cases,
  establishing the direct biological progression from chronic alcohol-induced liver
  damage to cirrhosis requiring hospital care. The meta-analysis synthesized evidence
  showing that ALD prevalence directly contributes to the burden of cirrhosis hospitalizations
  through the well-established pathophysiological cascade of hepatic steatosis, inflammation,
  fibrosis, and eventual cirrhosis with decompensation.
