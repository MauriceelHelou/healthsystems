description: Elevated glycine levels in the nucleus accumbens modulate dopamine release through glycine
  receptor activation, though response varies by individual, with only a subpopulation showing dopamine
  elevation.

  equity_implications: Individual biological variability in treatment response has implications for personalized
    medicine approaches. Ensuring equitable access to pharmacogenomic testing and tailored treatments
    is essential for health equity.
