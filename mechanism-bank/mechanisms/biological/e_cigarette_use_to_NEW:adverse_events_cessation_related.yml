direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Electronic cigarette use exposes airways to heated aerosol containing nicotine and carrier
  compounds'
- 'Step 2: Short-term irritation of oral and respiratory mucosa occurs'
- 'Step 3: Common transient symptoms include throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea'
- 'Step 4: These symptoms tend to dissipate with continued use as tolerance develops'

description: Adverse events may be more common with nicotine EC compared to behavioral support only (RR
  1.22), though evidence is very uncertain. Common AEs include throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough,
  and nausea, which typically resolve with continued use. AE rates are similar between nicotine EC and
  NRT.

  description: AE rates similar to NRT (RR 1.00) but possibly higher than behavioral support alone (RR

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Safety monitoring of novel nicotine products is a regulatory function with equity
    implications. Unregulated or illicit EC products may pose different risk profiles than regulated products
    studied in trials. Access to regulated products vs unregulated alternatives may differ by socioeconomic
    status and geographic location.
