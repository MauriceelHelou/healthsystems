  node_name: Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome / Delirium Tremens
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to significant alterations in neurotrophin
  levels, including reduced BDNF during active drinking and decreased NT-3 after alcohol
  exposure'
- 'Step 2: Neurotrophin dysregulation impairs neuromodulation and neuroplasticity
  mechanisms, compromising the brain''s ability to maintain normal neural function
  and recover from alcohol-induced damage'
- 'Step 3: During alcohol withdrawal, the altered neurotrophin signaling (particularly
  BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT-3, NT-4) contributes to neuronal vulnerability and oxidative
  stress'
- 'Step 4: GDNF dysfunction specifically affects dopaminergic neuron function, while
  NT-4 alterations exacerbate oxidative stress associated with withdrawal'
- 'Step 5: The combined neurotrophin imbalances contribute to the development of alcohol
  withdrawal syndrome and increase susceptibility to severe complications including
  delirium tremens'

description: Alterations in neurotrophin levels (BDNF, GDNF, NGF, NT-3, NT-4) during
  alcohol use disorder contribute to the development of alcohol withdrawal syndrome
  and delirium tremens through impaired neuromodulation, compromised neuroplasticity,
  and increased neuronal vulnerability. BDNF shows significant reduction during consumption,
  GDNF affects dopaminergic function, NGF protects against ethanol-induced cytotoxicity,
  NT-3 is involved in compensatory cognitive mechanisms, and NT-4 affects oxidative
  stress. These neurotrophins may serve as valuable biomarkers for withdrawal syndrome
  severity and delirium complications.
