direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) are absorbed and incorporated
  into hepatic cell membranes and lipid metabolism pathways'
- 'Step 2: Omega-3 PUFAs activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)
  and suppress sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), reducing hepatic
  triglyceride synthesis'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced fatty acid beta-oxidation in the liver and reduced very low-density
  lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion leads to decreased circulating triglyceride levels'
- 'Step 4: Improved serum lipid profiles observed with significant reductions in triglycerides
  alongside improvements in LDL and total cholesterol'

description: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation significantly reduces serum triglyceride
  levels through multiple hepatic mechanisms including enhanced fatty acid oxidation,
  reduced lipogenesis via SREBP-1c suppression, and decreased VLDL secretion. A meta-analysis
  of 15 studies in NAFLD patients and animal models demonstrated significant improvements
  in serum lipid profiles with reductions in triglycerides, LDL, and total cholesterol.
