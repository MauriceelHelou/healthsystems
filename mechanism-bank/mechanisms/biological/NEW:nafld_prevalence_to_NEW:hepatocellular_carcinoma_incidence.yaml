direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NAFLD develops due to hepatic fat accumulation exceeding 5% of liver weight
  in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, driven by metabolic dysfunction
  including insulin resistance and obesity'
- 'Step 2: Chronic hepatic steatosis progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
  with inflammation, hepatocyte injury, and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Persistent inflammation and hepatocyte damage trigger fibrogenic pathways,
  leading to progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: The chronically inflamed and fibrotic liver microenvironment promotes genomic
  instability, aberrant cell proliferation, and impaired tumor suppression mechanisms'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations in hepatocytes
  lead to malignant transformation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma'

description: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increases the incidence of
  hepatocellular carcinoma through a progressive pathway involving chronic hepatic
  inflammation, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and eventual cirrhosis. This systematic
  review and meta-analysis of 237 studies encompassing over 13 million participants
  in Asia demonstrated that NAFLD patients have an annual hepatocellular carcinoma
  incidence rate of 1.8 cases per 1000 person-years. The rising prevalence of NAFLD
  over time (from 25% to 34% between 1999-2017) indicates an increasing burden of
  NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
