- 'Step 1: Aggressive fluid resuscitation increases intravascular volume'

description: Higher volume fluid resuscitation strategies in sepsis are associated with increased need
  for mechanical ventilation, particularly in LMIC settings (OR 1.24). This represents the biological
  pathway through which aggressive fluid resuscitation leads to harm when ventilatory support is unavailable.

  variation_notes: Higher fluid volume was associated with increased need for mechanical ventilation in
    LMICs (OR 1.24) but not in HICs (OR 1.02).

  description: The association between higher fluid volumes and increased mechanical ventilation need
    is stronger in LMIC settings

  equity_implications: This mechanism represents the intermediate step linking treatment strategy to mortality
    through respiratory complications. The geographic variation suggests that patient populations in LMICs
    may be more vulnerable to fluid overload complications, potentially due to later presentation, different
    comorbidity profiles, or underlying nutritional status - all of which trace to structural determinants
    of health access and socioeconomic conditions.
