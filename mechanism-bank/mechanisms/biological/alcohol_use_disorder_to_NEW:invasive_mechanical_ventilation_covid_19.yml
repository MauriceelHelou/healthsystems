direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use damages alveolar epithelium and impairs surfactant production'
- 'Step 2: Compromised alveolar-capillary barrier increases susceptibility to acute lung injury'
- 'Step 3: Impaired mucociliary clearance allows greater viral load accumulation in lower airways'
- 'Step 4: Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome develops requiring mechanical ventilation'

description: 'European drinkers showed a 104% increased risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation
  for COVID-19 (RR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.96-2.13). This was the largest effect size observed in the meta-analysis,
  with no statistical heterogeneity across included studies, indicating highly consistent findings.'

  description: European populations showed doubled risk of requiring mechanical ventilation compared to
    non-drinkers
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The doubled risk of requiring mechanical ventilation among European drinkers reflects
    the accumulated physiological damage from alcohol consumption patterns shaped by cultural norms, pricing
    policies, and alcohol industry influence. Healthcare system capacity for mechanical ventilation varied
    significantly during pandemic surges, meaning this alcohol-related vulnerability had differential
    consequences based on where individuals lived and received care.
