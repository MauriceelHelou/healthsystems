description: Current drinkers demonstrated increased risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection.
  This suggests that active alcohol consumption at the time of viral exposure impairs the early immune
  response needed to control infection and prevent symptom development.

  equity_implications: This finding highlights the importance of pandemic-era alcohol policies. Decisions
    to keep liquor stores open as 'essential businesses' and changes in alcohol delivery regulations during
    lockdowns had public health implications. The link between current drinking and symptomatic infection
    suggests that pandemic alcohol policies were themselves structural determinants of COVID-19 outcomes.
