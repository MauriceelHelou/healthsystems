mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated serum cholesterol levels lead to increased deposition of cholesterol
  in arterial walls'
- 'Step 2: Cholesterol accumulation promotes the development of atherosclerotic plaques
  in coronary arteries'
- 'Step 3: Progressive atherosclerosis leads to narrowing of coronary arteries and
  increased risk of plaque rupture'
- 'Step 4: Plaque rupture or severe stenosis can result in myocardial infarction and
  coronary heart disease mortality'

description: 'The traditional diet-heart hypothesis posits that elevated serum cholesterol
  contributes to coronary heart disease mortality through atherosclerotic processes.
  However, this meta-analysis and recovered RCT data challenge the simplistic interpretation:
  while higher serum cholesterol is associated with coronary atherosclerosis, the
  intervention that lowered serum cholesterol by 13.8% showed a 22% higher risk of
  death per 30 mg/dL reduction. This suggests the mechanism linking cholesterol to
  CHD mortality is more complex than direct causation, and that not all cholesterol-lowering
  approaches translate to mortality benefit.'

    lowered serum cholesterol but paradoxically did not reduce CHD mortality, suggesting
    the relationship between cholesterol lowering and mortality may depend on the
    mechanism of cholesterol reduction
