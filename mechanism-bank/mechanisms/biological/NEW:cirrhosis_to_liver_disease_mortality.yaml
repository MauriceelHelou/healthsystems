mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cirrhosis causes progressive liver fibrosis and architectural distortion,
  leading to portal hypertension and hepatocellular dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Portal hypertension leads to development of complications including ascites
  (median survival 1.1 years), hepatic encephalopathy (median survival 0.92 years),
  variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome (median survival <2 weeks)'
- 'Step 3: Cirrhosis increases risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (1-4% annual incidence)
  with 5-year survival of approximately 20%'
- 'Step 4: Decompensated cirrhosis with multiple complications leads to progressive
  multi-organ failure and death from liver disease'

description: Cirrhosis directly causes liver disease mortality through progressive
  hepatocellular dysfunction and portal hypertension, leading to life-threatening
  complications. Age-adjusted mortality from cirrhosis increased from 14.9 to 21.9
  per 100,000 between 2010-2021. Median survival following onset of ascites is 1.1
  years and hepatic encephalopathy is 0.92 years. Hepatorenal syndrome carries median
  survival of less than 2 weeks. Annual hepatocellular carcinoma incidence of 1-4%
  with 5-year survival of approximately 20% further contributes to mortality.
