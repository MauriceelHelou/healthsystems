description: Tobacco smoking affects reproductive hormone levels (FSH, LH, testosterone) in infertile
  males, contributing to hormonal dysregulation that impairs fertility.
quantitative_effects:
  sample_size: 12503
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Endocrine disruption from tobacco reflects structural failures in protecting reproductive
    health. Occupational and environmental tobacco exposures disproportionately affect workers in certain
    industries and residents of under-regulated areas, creating structural pathways to fertility harm.
