- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD),
  including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and fibrosis'
- 'Step 2: Progressive liver damage from continued alcohol exposure leads to development
  of alcohol-associated cirrhosis in a subset of patients (prevalence 0.3% in general
  population, up to 12.9% in those with alcohol use disorder)'
- 'Step 3: Cirrhosis and advanced liver disease result in liver failure, portal hypertension,
  hepatic encephalopathy, and increased susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma'
- 'Step 4: These end-stage complications of ALD directly contribute to premature mortality,
  with ALD identified as a common cause of premature death'

description: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is established as a common cause
  of morbidity and premature mortality. This systematic review of 35 studies covering
  513,278 individuals demonstrates that while ALD prevalence is relatively low in
  general populations (3.5%) and primary care (2.6%), it is extremely high among those
  with alcohol use disorder (51.0%). Similarly, alcohol-associated cirrhosis, which
  carries high mortality risk, affects 0.3% of general populations but 12.9% of those
  with AUD. The progressive nature of ALD from fatty liver to cirrhosis represents
  the biological pathway through which alcohol exposure ultimately leads to liver
  disease mortality.
