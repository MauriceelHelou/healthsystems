  node_id: NEW:bradycardia_incidence
  node_name: Bradycardia Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dexmedetomidine acts as a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist'
- 'Step 2: Alpha-2 receptor activation reduces sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Decreased sympathetic tone leads to reduced heart rate'
- 'Step 4: Excessive reduction in heart rate manifests as bradycardia requiring clinical monitoring'

description: Adjunctive dexmedetomidine therapy is associated with significantly higher incidence of bradycardia
  compared to benzodiazepine therapy alone in both RCT and cohort subgroups.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The cardiovascular adverse effects of dexmedetomidine require intensive monitoring
    capacity, potentially limiting its use in under-resourced healthcare settings. This creates disparities
    in access to potentially beneficial AWS treatment options based on hospital infrastructure and staffing
    levels.
