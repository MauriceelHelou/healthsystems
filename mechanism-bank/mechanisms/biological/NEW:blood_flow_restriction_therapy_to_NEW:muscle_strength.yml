direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Blood flow restriction creates metabolic stress during low-load exercise'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic stress triggers hormonal responses and cellular signaling for muscle adaptation'
- 'Step 3: Proposed mechanism involves enhanced protein synthesis and muscle fiber hypertrophy'
- 'Step 4: Systematic review shows no significant strength gains beyond standard exercise protocols'

description: Blood flow restriction therapy combined with exercise does not significantly improve muscle
  strength compared to exercise alone at long-term follow-up (6-10 weeks), challenging claims of superior
  strength-building benefits.

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This evidence is important for rehabilitation settings and physical therapy access,
    indicating that effective strength training does not require expensive BFRT equipment, potentially
    improving equity in access to evidence-based rehabilitation.
