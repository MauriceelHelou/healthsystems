- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol overuse suppresses testicular testosterone production'

- 'Step 3: The pituitary responds with altered LH secretion patterns'
- 'Step 4: Feedback changes in LH levels occur as a compensatory mechanism'

description: 'The pooled analysis showed a small positive association between alcohol exposure and LH
  levels (SMD 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00-0.12), which approached statistical significance. The authors specifically
  note feedback changes in LH levels among those with alcohol use disorder, suggesting compensatory pituitary
  responses to alcohol-induced testosterone suppression.'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The HPT axis disruption seen in alcohol use disorder reflects the cumulative biological
    burden of chronic alcohol exposure. Structural factors including lack of treatment access, inadequate
    mental health services, economic instability, and community-level alcohol availability contribute
    to the development and persistence of alcohol use disorder. Addressing these upstream determinants
    is essential for preventing the downstream hormonal and reproductive health consequences.
