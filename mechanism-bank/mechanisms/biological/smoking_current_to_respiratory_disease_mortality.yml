- 'Step 1: High smoking prevalence (85%) among OAT patients creates substantial tobacco exposure'
- 'Step 2: Chronic tobacco smoke inhalation causes progressive pulmonary damage'
- 'Step 3: Smoking-related pulmonary diseases develop including COPD and lung cancer'
- 'Step 4: Pulmonary diseases contribute significantly to disability in this population'
- 'Step 5: Smoking-related pulmonary diseases are major contributors to mortality among OAT patients'

description: Smoking-related pulmonary diseases have significant impact on disability and mortality among
  patients receiving opioid agonist therapy
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The disproportionate burden of smoking-related mortality among people with opioid
    use disorder reflects cumulative disadvantage from substance use stigma, fragmented healthcare systems,
    and historical neglect of tobacco cessation in addiction treatment. This represents a health equity
    issue where marginalized populations face compounded mortality risk from both substance use and tobacco-related
    disease.
