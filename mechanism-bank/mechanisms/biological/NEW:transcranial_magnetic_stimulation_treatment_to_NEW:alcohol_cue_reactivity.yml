description: 'Active iTBS reduced alcohol cue-reactivity in multiple brain regions: left insula (d = -0.19
  vs. d = 0.51 for sham), left thalamus (d = -0.28 vs. d = 0.77), right insula (d = 0.18 vs. d = 0.52),
  and right thalamus (d = -0.06 vs. d = 0.62). Sham treatment showed increased cue-reactivity in these
  regions, while active treatment showed decreased or minimal change.'

  sample_size: 17
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cue-reactivity is relevant to structural determinants because environmental alcohol
    cues are more prevalent in certain communities due to alcohol outlet density and advertising exposure.
    While this mechanism addresses the biological response to cues, effective treatment could help individuals
    living in high-exposure environments better resist environmental triggers that are structurally determined.
