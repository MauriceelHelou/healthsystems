direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe SARS or MERS coronavirus infection triggers intense inflammatory
  response in lung tissue, particularly affecting the alveolar-capillary membrane'
- 'Step 2: Viral infection and host immune response cause diffuse alveolar damage,
  including destruction of type I and II pneumocytes and endothelial cells'
- 'Step 3: Acute phase damage leads to pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial thickening,
  and permanent structural changes to the alveolar-capillary interface'
- 'Step 4: Thickened or damaged alveolar-capillary membrane impairs gas diffusion,
  resulting in reduced DLCO that persists beyond acute infection'
- 'Step 5: Impaired diffusing capacity manifests as a common long-term pulmonary sequela
  in coronavirus survivors, detectable up to 6 months post-hospitalization'

description: 'Pooled meta-analysis of 28 studies examining SARS and MERS survivors
  found that impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is a common long-term
  complication, with a prevalence of 27% (95% CI: 15-45%) up to 6 months after hospitalization
  or ICU admission. This reflects persistent damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane
  from severe coronavirus infection.'
