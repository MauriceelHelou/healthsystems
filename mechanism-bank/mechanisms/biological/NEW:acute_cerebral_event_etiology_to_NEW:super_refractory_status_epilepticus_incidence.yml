mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute cerebral events (stroke, hemorrhage, infection, trauma) cause acute brain injury'
- 'Step 2: Acute brain injury triggers seizure activity through disruption of normal neuronal inhibition'
- 'Step 3: Severe acute cerebral insults may create refractory seizure circuits resistant to standard
  treatment'
- 'Step 4: Status epilepticus continues despite anesthetic therapy, meeting criteria for super-refractory
  status'

description: Acute cerebral events accounted for 41.6% of all SRSE etiologies, representing the most common
  cause. Unknown etiologies accounted for 22.3%. Notably, etiologies related to alcohol, drugs, or tumors
  were rare, indicating SRSE has a distinct etiological pattern different from other forms of status epilepticus.

  equity_implications: The predominance of acute cerebral events as SRSE etiology connects to broader
    structural determinants of cerebrovascular disease including hypertension management, diabetes control,
    and access to preventive cardiovascular care. The fact that alcohol-related SRSE was rare is notable
    given alcohol withdrawal is a common cause of other seizure types, suggesting SRSE represents a different
    pathophysiological entity. Equity implications relate to disparities in stroke prevention, emergency
    response times, and access to neurocritical care.
