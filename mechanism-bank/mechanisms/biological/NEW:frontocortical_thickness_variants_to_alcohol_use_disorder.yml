description: The study found that alcohol consumption and AUD share genetic overlap specifically with
  variants associated with decreased frontocortical thickness. This suggests that reduced prefrontal cortical
  structure—important for impulse control and decision-making—represents a shared vulnerability factor
  for both heavy drinking and progression to disorder.

  equity_implications: Evidence that frontal cortical thinning variants contribute to AUD supports neurobiological
    models of addiction. This has implications for how society responds to alcohol use disorders—emphasizing
    treatment access and harm reduction rather than punitive approaches. Structural policies affecting
    alcohol availability become more important given biological vulnerability factors.
