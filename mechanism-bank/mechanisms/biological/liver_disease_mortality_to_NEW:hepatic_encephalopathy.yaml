- 'Step 1: Progressive liver disease (cirrhosis) leads to impaired hepatic function
  and reduced capacity to metabolize ammonia and other neurotoxins'
- 'Step 2: Accumulation of ammonia and other gut-derived neurotoxins in systemic circulation
  due to portosystemic shunting and hepatocellular dysfunction'
- 'Step 3: Neurotoxins cross the blood-brain barrier, causing astrocyte swelling,
  neuroinflammation, and altered neurotransmission'
- 'Step 4: Development of hepatic encephalopathy manifesting as neuropsychiatric symptoms
  ranging from minimal (psychometric abnormalities) to overt (clinically apparent
  cognitive dysfunction)'
- 'Step 5: Hepatic encephalopathy contributes to increased morbidity and mortality
  in cirrhosis patients'

description: Hepatic encephalopathy is a common and serious complication of cirrhosis
  that significantly contributes to liver disease mortality. The exact pathogenesis
  involves ammonia and other neurotoxins that accumulate due to hepatic dysfunction
  and portosystemic shunting. The condition presents on a spectrum from minimal hepatic
  encephalopathy (detected only by psychometric testing) to overt hepatic encephalopathy
  with clear neuropsychiatric manifestations. This Cochrane systematic review of 11
  RCTs involving 943 participants found that hepatic encephalopathy has high associated
  morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients.
