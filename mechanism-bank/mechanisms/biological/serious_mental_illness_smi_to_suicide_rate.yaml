direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater psychiatric disorder severity involves more pronounced neurobiological
  dysregulation, including alterations in serotonergic, dopaminergic, and stress-response
  systems (HPA axis dysfunction)'
- 'Step 2: These neurobiological changes manifest as more severe symptoms including
  hopelessness, anhedonia, impulsivity, and cognitive rigidity that reduce capacity
  for adaptive coping'
- 'Step 3: Increased symptom severity leads to functional impairment, social isolation,
  and accumulated psychosocial stressors that compound biological vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: The combination of biological dysregulation and psychosocial deterioration
  elevates suicidal ideation and reduces inhibition against self-harm'
- 'Step 5: More severe psychiatric illness increases likelihood of suicide attempts
  and completed suicide through both impulsive and planned pathways'

description: Severity of psychiatric disorder is a robust predictor of suicide in
  psychiatric populations. Machine learning studies consistently identify disorder
  severity as a key feature distinguishing those at elevated suicide risk. The biological
  pathway involves neurobiological dysregulation associated with more severe psychiatric
  illness, including alterations in neurotransmitter systems and stress response mechanisms.
  These biological changes compound with psychosocial deterioration to increase suicide
  risk. Most ML prediction models achieved 70% or greater accuracy using severity
  as a key feature.
