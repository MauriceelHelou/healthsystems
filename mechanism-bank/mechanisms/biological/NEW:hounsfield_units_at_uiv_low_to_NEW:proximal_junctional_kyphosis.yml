direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low Hounsfield units (HU) on CT imaging at the upper instrumented vertebra indicate poor local
  bone density at the critical surgical junction'
- 'Step 2: Reduced bone density at the UIV compromises the bone-implant interface and fixation strength'
- 'Step 3: Surgical instrumentation creates a transition zone with concentrated mechanical stress at the
  proximal junction'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate bone quality leads to instrumentation failure, vertebral fracture, or ligamentous
  failure at the junction'
- 'Step 5: Progressive angular kyphotic deformity develops at the proximal junction'

description: Patients who developed proximal junctional kyphosis had significantly lower Hounsfield units
  at the upper instrumented vertebra compared to those who did not develop PJK, with a mean difference
  of -32.35 HU. This site-specific measure of bone density showed lower heterogeneity (I²=28.7%) than
  the T-score analysis, suggesting it may be a more consistent predictor.

  equity_implications: Local bone density at surgical sites reflects cumulative exposure to factors affecting
    bone health throughout the lifespan. Structural factors including nutritional access, occupational
    physical demands, access to osteoporosis screening and treatment, and environmental exposures all
    contribute to bone quality. Healthcare system factors such as access to preoperative bone density
    optimization may also influence outcomes.
