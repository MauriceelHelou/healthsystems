direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Blood flow restriction during resistance exercise limits venous return'
- 'Step 2: Limited blood flow theoretically enhances fast-twitch muscle fiber recruitment'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced fiber recruitment proposed to improve torque-generating capacity'
- 'Step 4: Meta-analysis shows no significant torque improvements versus exercise alone'

description: Blood flow restriction therapy with exercise shows no significant improvement in muscle torque
  compared to exercise alone, with high heterogeneity evidenced by wide confidence intervals.

  description: Intermediate (SMD 0.90, 95% CI -1.01, 2.81) and long-term effects both showed wide confidence
    intervals crossing null
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: The null finding suggests that functional strength outcomes can be achieved with
    standard exercise, which has implications for rehabilitation accessibility in resource-limited settings.
