direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Obesity creates baseline hepatic metabolic stress through increased free
  fatty acid delivery to the liver and insulin resistance'
- 'Step 2: Obesity lowers the threshold of alcohol consumption required to initiate
  liver damage, making the liver more susceptible to alcohol''s toxic effects'
- 'Step 3: Combined metabolic burden from obesity and alcohol accelerates hepatic
  fat accumulation (steatosis) through synergistic lipotoxicity and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 4: The interaction between obesity and alcohol consumption increases the likelihood
  of progression from simple steatosis to more advanced liver disease'

description: Obesity is identified as the most common comorbid factor that lowers
  the threshold of alcohol consumption required to develop alcohol-related liver disease.
  While ArLD typically occurs after a threshold of alcohol consumption, obesity modifies
  this relationship by making individuals more susceptible to alcohol-induced hepatic
  damage at lower consumption levels. Alcohol-related steatosis is the most common
  stage of ArLD, and the synergistic effect of obesity and alcohol accelerates the
  development of hepatic fat accumulation.

  description: The threshold of alcohol consumption required to cause ArLD is lowered
    in the presence of obesity, meaning lower levels of alcohol can cause liver damage
    when obesity is present
