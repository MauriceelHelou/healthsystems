  node_id: cognitive_disability
  node_name: Cognitive Disability
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic exposure to inflammatory triggers (e.g., alcohol, systemic inflammation)
  activates microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain'
- 'Step 2: Activated microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators within
  the central nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Sustained neuroinflammatory processes disrupt neuronal signaling, synaptic
  plasticity, and neurotransmitter function'
- 'Step 4: Chronic microglial activation leads to attenuated neuroprotective responses
  and potential neurotoxicity'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative neuronal damage and dysfunction manifest as cognitive deterioration
  across multiple domains including memory, executive function, and processing speed'

description: Neuroinflammation contributes to cognitive disability through pro-inflammatory
  processes that exacerbate deterioration across multiple cognitive domains. Microglia
  initially provide neuroprotective functions during acute inflammatory exposure,
  but chronic neuroinflammation attenuates these protective responses, leading to
  sustained neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.
