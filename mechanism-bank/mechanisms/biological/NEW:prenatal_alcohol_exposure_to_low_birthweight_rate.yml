direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol crosses placenta and disrupts nutrient transfer to fetus'
- 'Step 2: Ethanol impairs placental function and fetal growth factors'
- 'Step 3: Cellular damage and reduced cell proliferation occur in developing fetus'
- 'Step 4: Intrauterine growth restriction results in lower birth weight'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Physical size effects at birth reflect upstream structural factors including alcohol
    policy environment, access to prenatal care and screening, socioeconomic stressors that may contribute
    to drinking, and availability of treatment services. Health equity implications include disparities
    in prenatal care access and substance use treatment availability across different populations.
