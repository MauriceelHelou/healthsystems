direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Periodontal disease causes chronic oral bacterial infection and inflammation
  in gum tissues'
- 'Step 2: Periodontal pathogens and inflammatory mediators enter the systemic circulation
  through compromised oral tissues'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation promotes endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis
  progression, and increased thrombotic risk'
- 'Step 4: Atherosclerotic changes in cerebral vasculature combined with increased
  clotting tendency elevate stroke risk'
- 'Step 5: Individuals with periodontal disease experience 26% increased risk of stroke
  compared to those without'

description: This meta-analysis of 39 prospective cohort studies with over 4.3 million
  individuals demonstrates that periodontal disease is significantly associated with
  a 26% increased risk of stroke. The biological mechanism involves chronic oral infection
  leading to systemic inflammation, which promotes atherosclerosis and thrombotic
  processes affecting cerebral vasculature. While the precise mechanistic link requires
  further elucidation, the consistent epidemiological association supports periodontal
  disease as a modifiable risk factor for stroke.
