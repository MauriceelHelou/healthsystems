mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced neuroadaptations enhance basal ganglia/salience network connectivity'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced connectivity with striatum, precuneus, and insula develops'
- 'Step 3: Salience attribution to alcohol-related cues becomes exaggerated'
- 'Step 4: Self-referential processing (precuneus) becomes coupled with reward circuitry'
- 'Step 5: This connectivity pattern increases vulnerability to relapse and treatment dropout'

description: Treatment non-completers showed enhanced connectivity between basal ganglia/salience network
  and striatum, precuneus, and insula. This pattern suggests that aberrant salience processing and self-referential
  activity contribute to relapse vulnerability.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Aberrant salience network function represents a neural mechanism that makes alcohol-related
    stimuli disproportionately attention-grabbing. This has implications for treatment environments and
    the importance of reducing environmental triggers in recovery settings.
