direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inhalation of PM2.5 particles allows deep penetration into the lower respiratory
  tract due to their small size (≤2.5 micrometers)'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 particles deposit in bronchial airways and alveoli, triggering local
  inflammatory responses and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 3: Airway inflammation leads to bronchial hyperresponsiveness, increased mucus
  production, and airway narrowing in susceptible individuals'
- 'Step 4: In individuals with asthma, PM2.5 exposure exacerbates underlying airway
  inflammation and triggers acute asthma attacks'
- 'Step 5: Severe asthma exacerbations requiring emergency care and hospitalization
  increase following PM2.5 exposure events'

description: PM2.5 exposure has a consistent positive association with asthma hospitalization
  rates, demonstrated across multiple time-series studies globally. The association
  between PM2.5 and respiratory health effects is stronger than for cardiovascular
  diseases, particularly in short-term exposure studies. The mechanism involves direct
  airway inflammation, oxidative stress, and exacerbation of underlying asthmatic
  conditions leading to increased healthcare utilization including hospitalizations.
