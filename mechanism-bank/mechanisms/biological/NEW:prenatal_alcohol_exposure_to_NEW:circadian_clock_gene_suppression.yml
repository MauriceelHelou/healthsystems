description: Prenatal alcohol exposure suppresses circadian clock genes through epigenetic mechanisms,
  disrupting the normal rhythmic regulation of the HPA axis and stress hormone release patterns.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Circadian disruption from prenatal alcohol exposure represents biological embedding
    of social conditions. Communities with higher alcohol outlet density, fewer treatment resources, or
    greater economic stressors may have higher rates of prenatal alcohol exposure, leading to population-level
    circadian and stress dysregulation.
