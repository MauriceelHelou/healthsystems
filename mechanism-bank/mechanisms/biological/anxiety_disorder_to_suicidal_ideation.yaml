direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Anxiety disorders involve dysregulation of stress response systems including
  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and elevated cortisol levels'
- 'Step 2: Chronic anxiety leads to persistent hyperarousal, sleep disturbances, and
  neurobiological changes affecting serotonergic and noradrenergic systems'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological alterations impair emotional regulation and increase
  psychological distress, hopelessness, and feelings of entrapment'
- 'Step 4: The combination of heightened physiological stress responses and impaired
  coping mechanisms increases vulnerability to suicidal ideation'

description: Anxiety is identified as an underlying factor that predisposes individuals
  to suicidal ideation. The systematic review of 34 studies found that higher rates
  of anxiety, along with other mental health conditions, are consistently associated
  with emergence of suicidal tendencies. This relationship operates through biological
  stress response mechanisms that become dysregulated with chronic anxiety, leading
  to neurobiological changes that impair emotional regulation and increase vulnerability
  to suicidal thoughts.
