  in impulse control'

description: TBI can serve as a risk factor for or modulate the course of alcohol use disorder through
  neuropsychological and neurobiological mechanisms. Brain injury damages regions involved in impulse
  control and reward processing, increasing vulnerability to problematic alcohol use.

  description: More severe TBI likely causes greater neurological damage affecting impulse control and
    decision-making

  description: Access to comprehensive rehabilitation services may mitigate neuropsychological deficits
    and reduce AUD risk
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This inverse relationship highlights how injury outcomes are shaped by access to
    rehabilitation services, which varies by insurance status, geographic location, and socioeconomic
    position. Communities with fewer healthcare resources face compounded disadvantage as TBI survivors
    lack support to prevent secondary AUD development.
