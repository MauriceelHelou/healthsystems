direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Population consumes alcohol at a given level'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol (ethanol) is metabolized to acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen'
- 'Step 3: Acetaldehyde causes DNA damage, oxidative stress, and impairs DNA repair mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure leads to increased risk of various cancers (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx,
  esophagus, liver, colorectal, breast)'
- 'Step 5: Population-level cancer incidence increases proportionally to consumption levels'

description: Over 35,000 cancer cases in 2018 across the 4 countries (Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Sweden)
  were attributable to alcohol consumption. Alcohol is a leading modifiable risk factor for cancer through
  direct carcinogenic effects of acetaldehyde and other mechanisms.

  variation_notes: The highest rate of alcohol-attributable cancers was recorded in Germany and the lowest
    in Sweden, reflecting differences in consumption patterns and baseline alcohol policies across the
    4 countries.

  description: Countries with higher per capita alcohol consumption have higher alcohol-attributable cancer
    rates
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism links population consumption levels (shaped by pricing, availability,
    and social norms) to cancer outcomes, avoiding individual blame by framing alcohol consumption as
    a product of structural conditions. The disparity between countries reflects different policy environments
    rather than individual choices.
