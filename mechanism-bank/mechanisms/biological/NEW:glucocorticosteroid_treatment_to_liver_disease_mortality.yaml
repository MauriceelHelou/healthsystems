direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Glucocorticosteroids are administered to patients with alcoholic hepatitis
  to suppress inflammatory response and reduce hepatic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Despite anti-inflammatory effects, glucocorticosteroids may increase susceptibility
  to infections and other serious adverse events in patients with compromised liver
  function'
- 'Step 3: The immunosuppressive effects combined with already impaired hepatic metabolism
  may lead to complications that could theoretically increase mortality risk'
- 'Step 4: However, current evidence shows no statistically significant difference
  in all-cause or liver-related mortality between glucocorticosteroid treatment and
  placebo/no intervention'

description: This Cochrane systematic review of 16 randomized clinical trials (1861
  participants) found no evidence that glucocorticosteroids affect all-cause mortality
  (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.15) or liver-related mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69-1.14)
  in people with alcoholic hepatitis compared to placebo or no intervention. The direction
  is coded as positive (indicating potential for increased mortality risk) based on
  the pathway classification, but the actual evidence shows a null effect with wide
  confidence intervals that cannot rule out either benefits or harms. The certainty
  of evidence was rated as very low due to high risk of bias in most trials.
