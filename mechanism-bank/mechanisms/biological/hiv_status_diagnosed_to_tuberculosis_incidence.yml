description: Prisoners infected with HIV are at significantly elevated risk of developing tuberculosis,
  with relative risks ranging from 2.0 to 10.75. This systematic review of 46 papers documents the high
  burden of HIV/TB co-infection in prison populations worldwide.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Co-infection prevalence ranged from 2.4% to 73.1% across different prisons and countries;
    relative risks ranged from 2.0 to 10.75; some studies reported no significant association between
    HIV and TB

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural determinants including mass incarceration policies
    that concentrate vulnerable populations, inadequate healthcare infrastructure in prisons, and systemic
    neglect of prison health. The prison environment itself - characterized by overcrowding, poor ventilation,
    and limited healthcare access - creates conditions that amplify the biological vulnerability of HIV-positive
    individuals to TB infection. Equity implications are significant as incarcerated populations are disproportionately
    from marginalized racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups.
