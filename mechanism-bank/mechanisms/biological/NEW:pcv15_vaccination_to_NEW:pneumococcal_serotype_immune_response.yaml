direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PCV15 vaccine containing 15 pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes conjugated
  to carrier proteins is administered intramuscularly'
- 'Step 2: Conjugated polysaccharide antigens are processed by antigen-presenting
  cells and presented to T-helper cells, enabling T-cell dependent immune responses'
- 'Step 3: B-cell activation occurs with T-cell help, leading to class switching and
  production of serotype-specific IgG antibodies against all 15 pneumococcal serotypes'
- 'Step 4: Immunological memory is established through generation of memory B-cells,
  providing durable protection against pneumococcal serotypes including unique serotypes
  22F and 33F'
- 'Step 5: Serotype-specific antibody responses are generated that are non-inferior
  to PCV13 for shared serotypes and superior for the two additional serotypes (22F
  and 33F)'

description: PCV15 administration induces robust serotype-specific immune responses
  against 15 pneumococcal serotypes. Meta-analysis of 20 RCTs demonstrates non-inferiority
  compared to PCV13 for 12-13 shared serotypes in both infants and adults, with significantly
  enhanced immune responses to the additional serotypes 22F and 33F that are unique
  to PCV15. The conjugated vaccine design enables T-cell dependent immunity with immunological
  memory formation.
