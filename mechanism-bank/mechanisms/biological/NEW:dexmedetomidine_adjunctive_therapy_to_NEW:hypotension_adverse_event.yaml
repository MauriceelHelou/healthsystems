direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dexmedetomidine acts as a selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist
  in the central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Alpha-2 receptor activation in the brainstem reduces sympathetic outflow
  and decreases catecholamine release'
- 'Step 3: Reduced sympathetic tone leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects of reduced cardiac output and vasodilation result in hypotension
  as an adverse event'

description: Dexmedetomidine, when used as adjunctive therapy for alcohol withdrawal
  syndrome, increases the risk of hypotension as an adverse event. This occurs through
  its alpha-2 adrenergic agonist mechanism, which reduces sympathetic nervous system
  activity and leads to decreased vascular resistance and blood pressure. This systematic
  review and meta-analysis included 6 studies examining this secondary outcome.
