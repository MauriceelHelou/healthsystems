direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury causes persistent cognitive, physical, and behavioral
  impairments'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive deficits (memory, attention, executive function) reduce capacity for workplace demands'
- 'Step 3: Physical impairments and fatigue limit ability to perform job-related tasks'
- 'Step 4: Employers may lack accommodations or understanding of TBI-related disabilities'
- 'Step 5: Survivors face barriers to maintaining or obtaining competitive employment, resulting in unemployment'

description: Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury substantially reduces post-injury employment, with
  only 42.2% of survivors employed post-injury. This reflects the disabling effects of TBI on cognitive
  and physical function necessary for competitive employment.

  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how healthcare system capacity for rehabilitation, workplace
    accommodation policies, disability employment support systems, and social safety nets determine employment
    outcomes following TBI. The burden falls disproportionately on populations with higher TBI rates (young
    males, those in manual labor occupations, lower socioeconomic groups) and those with less access to
    comprehensive rehabilitation services.
