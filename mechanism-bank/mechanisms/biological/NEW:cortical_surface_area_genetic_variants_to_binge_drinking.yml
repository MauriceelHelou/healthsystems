description: Variants associated with increased cortical surface area show overlap between sensation seeking
  and alcohol consumption phenotypes, suggesting shared neuroanatomical genetic architecture underlying
  both traits.

  equity_implications: Identifying neuroimaging correlates of genetic risk helps understand biological
    mechanisms without blaming individuals. These findings support universal structural interventions
    rather than targeted approaches that could stigmatize those with particular brain characteristics.
