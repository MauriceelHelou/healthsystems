direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe coronavirus infection (SARS/MERS) causes acute lung injury requiring
  hospitalization or ICU admission, with direct viral damage to alveolar epithelial
  cells and pulmonary vasculature'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory response and immune-mediated damage leads to pulmonary fibrosis
  and impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), with 27% prevalence
  of DLCO impairment at 6 months'
- 'Step 3: Residual lung function abnormalities combined with deconditioning from
  prolonged illness and hospitalization result in reduced cardiopulmonary reserve'
- 'Step 4: Persistent pulmonary dysfunction manifests as reduced exercise capacity,
  with mean 6-minute walk distance of 461 meters (below normal expected values for
  healthy adults)'

description: 'Severe coronavirus infections requiring hospitalization or ICU admission
  lead to persistent reduced exercise capacity as measured by 6-minute walk distance.
  Meta-analysis of 28 studies found mean 6MWD of 461 meters (95% CI: 450-473m) in
  SARS/MERS survivors, which is below normal expected values. This reduction is mechanistically
  linked to persistent pulmonary dysfunction including impaired gas exchange (DLCO
  abnormalities in 27% of survivors) and likely compounded by deconditioning during
  acute illness.'
