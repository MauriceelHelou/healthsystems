direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants (identified through genomic studies) confer inherited susceptibility to alcohol-related
  problems'
- 'Step 2: These genetic risk factors influence neurobiological pathways affecting reward processing,
  impulse control, and stress response'
- 'Step 3: Genetic predisposition interacts with environmental exposures to increase risk of progression
  from regular drinking to problematic drinking'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic risk manifests as higher likelihood of developing alcohol use disorder'

description: Genetic information serves as risk and prognostic biomarkers for the onset of alcohol-related
  problems and progression from regular drinking to problematic drinking including AUD. This biological
  mechanism operates through inherited variants that affect neurobiological substrates of addiction vulnerability.

  equity_implications: While genetic factors are biological, understanding them can inform structural
    interventions. Genetic risk is not deterministic - structural factors like alcohol availability, marketing
    exposure, and access to treatment modify whether genetic predisposition manifests as disorder. Equity
    implications include ensuring genetic research includes diverse populations and that genetic risk
    information does not lead to discrimination or blame.
