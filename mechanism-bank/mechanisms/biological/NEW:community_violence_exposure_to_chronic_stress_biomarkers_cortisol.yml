direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to community violence acts as a chronic environmental stressor in neighborhoods with
  concentrated disadvantage'
- 'Step 2: Repeated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to violence
  exposure'
- 'Step 3: Dysregulation of cortisol secretion patterns as a primary mediator of allostatic load'
- 'Step 4: Altered cortisol levels (both elevated and blunted responses) indicate physiological wear and
  tear from chronic stress'

description: Community violence exposure functions as a chronic environmental stressor that disrupts cortisol
  regulation, one of the four primary mediators of allostatic load. This systematic review of 36 studies
  demonstrates that violence in neighborhoods triggers sustained HPA axis activation, leading to physiological
  dysregulation.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Community violence exposure varies substantially by neighborhood and geographic context,
    with higher rates in structurally disadvantaged areas

  description: Direct victimization versus witnessing violence may have differential effects on biomarker
    responses

  description: Chronic, repeated exposure leads to greater allostatic load compared to acute single exposures
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces community violence to structural factors including neighborhood
    disinvestment, concentrated poverty, lack of community resources, and systemic inequities in policing
    and safety infrastructure. The burden of violence exposure falls disproportionately on Black and Brown
    communities and low-income neighborhoods, reflecting structural racism and economic marginalization
    rather than individual choices.
