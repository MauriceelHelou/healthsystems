direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lichen sclerosus causes chronic inflammation of genital skin and mucosal
  tissues, leading to progressive structural changes'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory processes result in loss of normal genital architecture, tissue
  atrophy, and scarring in affected areas'
- 'Step 3: Architectural alterations cause narrowing of the vaginal introitus in women
  and phimosis in men, creating mechanical barriers to sexual activity'
- 'Step 4: Tissue changes including atrophy, erosions, and ulcerations increase sensitivity
  and pain during sexual contact'
- 'Step 5: Pain/burning/discomfort symptoms and structural changes combine to produce
  dyspareunia and broader sexual dysfunction'

description: Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that predominantly
  affects genital tissues, causing progressive architectural changes, atrophy, pigmentary
  alterations, and symptoms including pruritus, pain, and burning. These pathological
  changes directly contribute to sexual dysfunction and dyspareunia as recognized
  complications. The systematic review documented sexual dysfunction including dyspareunia
  among the established complications of LS, with the underlying mechanism involving
  structural alterations that create mechanical barriers and tissue sensitivity that
  causes pain during sexual activity.
