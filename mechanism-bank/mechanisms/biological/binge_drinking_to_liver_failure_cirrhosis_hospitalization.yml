description: Heavy alcohol consumption at 80g/day is associated with nearly 8-fold increased risk of liver
  cirrhosis in males. The relationship is non-linear, with risk accelerating at higher consumption levels.
  This systematic review pooled data from over 3 million participants with over 8,500 liver cirrhosis
  cases.

  equity_implications: Structural determinants of heavy alcohol consumption include alcohol marketing,
    outlet density, pricing policies, occupational stress, economic insecurity, and limited access to
    treatment services. The dramatic sex differences in vulnerability suggest need for sex-specific clinical
    guidelines and prevention policies that account for differential biological susceptibility.
