  node_type: crisis_endpoint
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
  - 'Step 1: Rapid consumption of large alcohol quantities (binge drinking) produces blood alcohol concentration (BAC) >0.20-0.30 g/dL'
  - 'Step 2: High BAC causes CNS depression affecting medullary respiratory and cardiovascular centers'
  - 'Step 3: Loss of protective reflexes leads to aspiration risk, respiratory depression, and potential airway obstruction'
  - 'Step 4: Severe intoxication (BAC >0.30) can cause hypotension, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and coma'
  - 'Step 5: Emergency presentation occurs due to altered mental status, respiratory distress, or witnessed severe intoxication requiring medical stabilization'

  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Alcohol poisoning ED visits reflect individual biology but occur within social contexts shaped by structural factors. College binge drinking is normalized through industry marketing and inadequate campus policies. Young people in economically distressed communities face predatory alcohol outlet density and limited youth programming. Emergency departments become default acute care sites for communities lacking preventive substance use services. High ED visit rates in specific populations signal policy failures in alcohol regulation, youth development, and healthcare access, not individual irresponsibility.
assumptions:
  - 'Assumes rapid consumption pattern producing BAC spike (4-5 drinks in 1-2 hours)'
  - 'ED presentation depends on bystander recognition and willingness to seek help'
  - 'Not all binge drinking episodes produce ED-level intoxication'
limitations:
  - 'Many severe intoxication episodes do not result in ED presentation due to fear of consequences or lack of access'
  - 'Individual alcohol tolerance and metabolism create variability in toxicity threshold'
  - 'Mechanism captures acute toxicity, not chronic health effects of binge drinking'
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: ED visit rates vary by drinking culture, ED availability, college town demographics, and state alcohol policies
  relevant_geographies:
    - 'College towns show spikes during academic year and events (homecoming, spring break)'
    - 'Rural areas may have delayed presentation due to ED access barriers'
    - 'States with lower minimum drinking age enforcement show higher youth rates'
    - 'Urban areas with high alcohol outlet density concentrate ED visits at safety-net hospitals'
