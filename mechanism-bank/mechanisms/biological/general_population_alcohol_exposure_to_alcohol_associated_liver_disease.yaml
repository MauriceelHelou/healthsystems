mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Population-level alcohol consumption includes a spectrum from low to heavy
  drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Hepatotoxic effects occur across the drinking spectrum, though severity
  correlates with dose and duration'
- 'Step 3: Even in unselected populations, 3.5% develop detectable alcohol-associated
  liver disease'
- 'Step 4: This baseline prevalence reflects the population-attributable burden of
  alcohol on liver health'
