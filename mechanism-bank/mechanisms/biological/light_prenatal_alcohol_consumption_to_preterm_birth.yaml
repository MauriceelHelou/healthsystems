mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-level alcohol exposure triggers inflammatory responses in maternal
  and placental tissues'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolites may disrupt hormonal signaling involved in maintaining
  pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure potentially compromises placental integrity and function'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative physiological stress may trigger premature labor mechanisms'
