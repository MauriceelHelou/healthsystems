direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption induces epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, histone modifications)
  that alter gene expression'
- 'Step 2: These epigenetic changes serve as diagnostic biomarkers reflecting alcohol exposure patterns'
- 'Step 3: Epigenetic modifications can persist and accumulate with continued alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative epigenetic changes contribute to the biological underpinnings of alcohol use disorder'

description: Epigenetic modifications serve dual roles as diagnostic biomarkers for AUD and risk biomarkers
  for alcohol consumption. These molecular changes reflect the biological imprint of alcohol exposure
  on gene regulation and can inform both diagnosis and risk assessment.

  description: Longer and heavier drinking patterns likely produce more pronounced epigenetic changes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Epigenetic markers reflect the biological embodiment of environmental exposures,
    including structural factors that influence alcohol consumption patterns (availability, marketing,
    socioeconomic stress). Understanding epigenetics helps explain how social conditions 'get under the
    skin.' This knowledge can support arguments for upstream structural interventions rather than individual-level
    blame.
