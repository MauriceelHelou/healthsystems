direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic viral hepatitis infection (HBV/HCV) establishes persistent infection
  in hepatocytes, causing ongoing liver inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Repeated cycles of hepatocyte injury and regeneration lead to accumulated
  genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation promotes fibrosis progression and creates a pro-carcinogenic
  microenvironment'
- 'Step 4: Viral proteins (e.g., HBx in HBV) directly contribute to genomic instability
  and oncogenic signaling pathway activation'
- 'Step 5: Combined with environmental co-exposures (e.g., vinyl chloride), viral
  hepatitis shows additive effects on hepatocellular carcinoma risk'

description: Viral hepatitis infection is a well-established biological cause of hepatocellular
  carcinoma through chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and direct viral oncogenic mechanisms.
  This paper specifically notes that viral hepatitis has additive effects with environmental
  exposures like vinyl chloride on hepatocellular carcinoma risk, highlighting the
  importance of gene-environment interactions in liver carcinogenesis.
