direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Omega-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) are incorporated into hepatocyte cell membranes
  following supplementation'
- 'Step 2: Omega-3 PUFAs activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs),
  particularly PPAR-alpha, which regulate lipid metabolism and reduce hepatic lipogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Reduced hepatic fat accumulation and decreased oxidative stress lead to
  diminished hepatocellular injury'
- 'Step 4: With less hepatocyte damage, there is reduced release of ALT enzyme into
  the bloodstream, resulting in lower serum ALT levels'

description: Omega-3 PUFA supplementation significantly reduces serum ALT levels,
  a marker of hepatocellular injury. This meta-analysis of 15 studies demonstrated
  a mean reduction of 2.12 U/L in ALT levels among NAFLD patients receiving omega-3
  supplementation. The mechanism involves reduced hepatic lipogenesis, decreased oxidative
  stress, and improved liver function through PPAR activation pathways.
