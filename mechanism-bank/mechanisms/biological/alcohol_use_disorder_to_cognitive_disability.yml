- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol misuse causes direct neurological damage'
- 'Step 2: Mnemonic (memory) domain functions become impaired'
- 'Step 3: Additional cognitive domains may be affected (as studied through neuropsychological assessment)'

description: Alcohol use disorder contributes to cognitive impairments, particularly affecting memory
  functions. The review synthesizes evidence from neuropsychological assessments demonstrating these impairments
  across clinical populations with AUD.

  description: Cognitive impairments from alcohol may show reversibility with sustained abstinence, unlike
    progressive dementias
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Cognitive disability from AUD represents a preventable outcome that requires upstream
    intervention. Structural factors influencing alcohol access, affordability, and treatment availability
    determine population-level cognitive health outcomes. Equity implications include differential access
    to treatment and recovery support services.
