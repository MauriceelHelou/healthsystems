direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to direct neurotoxic effects on oligodendrocytes
  and myelin-producing cells in the central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation cause degradation
  of myelin sheaths and disruption of axonal integrity'
- 'Step 3: Macro- and microstructural white matter alterations develop in specific
  vulnerable regions including the corpus callosum (genu and body), anterior and posterior
  cingulum, fornix, and right posterior limb of internal capsule'
- 'Step 4: These white matter changes disrupt interhemispheric communication and connectivity
  between brain regions, contributing to cognitive, motor, affective, and perceptual
  impairments characteristic of AUD'

description: This meta-analysis of 18 neuroimaging studies (462 AUD patients, 416
  healthy controls) using VBM and DTI methods identified four significant clusters
  of convergent white matter alterations in AUD patients. These alterations were localized
  to the genu and body of the corpus callosum, anterior and posterior cingulum, fornix,
  and the right posterior limb of the internal capsule. Anatomical likelihood estimation
  (ALE) revealed consistent spatial convergence of reported findings across studies,
  indicating that chronic alcohol use leads to both macrostructural and microstructural
  white matter damage in these specific brain regions.
