direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol, tobacco, and substance use directly affects immune cell
  function and inflammatory pathways'
- 'Step 2: Substances impair production and function of white blood cells, antibodies,
  and cytokines'
- 'Step 3: Compromised immune surveillance reduces capacity to fight infections'
- 'Step 4: Impaired immune system increases vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 and severe
  COVID-19 infections'
