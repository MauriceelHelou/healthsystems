direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Personality disorders (PDs) are characterized by dysregulated emotional
  processing, impulsivity, and difficulties with interpersonal relationships, creating
  neurobiological vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 2: Historical interpersonal trauma (e.g., childhood abuse) common in PD populations
  leads to altered stress response systems and heightened emotional reactivity'
- 'Step 3: Comorbid substance use (drugs and alcohol) in PD populations further impairs
  judgment and disinhibits self-destructive behavior'
- 'Step 4: Ideation-to-enaction factors (acquired capability for suicide, reduced
  fear of death) facilitate progression from suicidal thoughts to attempts'
- 'Step 5: These combined factors result in substantially elevated rates of suicide
  attempts and completed suicide compared to general population and many other mental
  health diagnoses'

description: This systematic review of 34 studies demonstrates that suicide risk is
  particularly elevated in people with personality disorders compared to those with
  no mental health diagnosis or many other mental health conditions. The pathway involves
  historical interpersonal trauma, substance use, and ideation-to-enaction factors
  that facilitate transition from suicidal ideation to action. Despite this elevated
  risk, suicide prevention strategies for PD populations have not progressed markedly.
