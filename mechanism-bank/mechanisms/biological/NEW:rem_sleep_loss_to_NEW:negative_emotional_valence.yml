direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Selective loss of REM sleep disrupts emotion regulation processes that occur during this sleep
  stage'
- 'Step 2: REM sleep normally facilitates processing of emotional experiences and reduces negative affect'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate REM, individuals report greater negative valence in response to emotional
  stimuli'
- 'Step 4: This pattern differs significantly from slow wave sleep loss, indicating REM-specific emotional
  functions'

description: Loss of REM sleep specifically increases reports of negative emotional valence in response
  to emotional stimuli (SMD=0.35, p=.023), an effect not seen with slow wave sleep loss (SMD=0.09, p=.088).
  This highlights the unique role of REM sleep in emotional regulation.

    compared to slow wave sleep loss (SMD=0.09, p=.088)
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: REM sleep occurs predominantly in later sleep cycles, meaning those who must cut
    sleep short (due to work schedules, caregiving, or economic pressures) disproportionately lose REM
    sleep. This creates a specific pathway through which structural time poverty translates to emotional
    dysregulation.
