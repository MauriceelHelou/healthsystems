mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption leads to metabolism of ethanol primarily in
  hepatic cells through alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1)
  pathways'
- 'Step 2: CYP2E1 induction by chronic alcohol use generates reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) as byproducts during ethanol oxidation'
- 'Step 3: Acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of alcohol, further contributes to
  oxidative stress through mitochondrial dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Excessive ROS generation overwhelms cellular antioxidant defenses, exposing
  DNA to continuous oxidative stress'
- 'Step 5: The sustained oxidative environment leads to DNA damage, activation of
  repair machinery (ATM, ATR, H2AX, MRN complex), and potential epigenetic modifications
  affecting gene expression'

description: Chronic alcohol intake promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species
  within hepatic cells through the metabolism of ethanol via CYP2E1 and other pathways.
  This excessive ROS generation exposes cellular DNA to continuous oxidative stress,
  activates DNA repair machinery, and can lead to epigenetic modifications. Genetic
  polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes (ADH, ALDH, CYP2E1, GST genes) influence individual
  susceptibility to ROS-mediated damage.
