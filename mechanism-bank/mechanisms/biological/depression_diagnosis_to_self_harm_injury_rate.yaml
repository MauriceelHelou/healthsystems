direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depressed mood involves neurobiological changes including dysregulation
  of serotonergic and dopaminergic systems, affecting emotional regulation and impulse
  control'
- 'Step 2: Depression leads to hopelessness, emotional pain, and cognitive distortions
  that increase suicidal ideation and self-harm urges'
- 'Step 3: Impaired executive function and emotional dysregulation associated with
  depression reduce capacity to cope with distress through adaptive means'
- 'Step 4: These neurobiological and psychological factors culminate in increased
  deliberate self-harm behavior as a maladaptive response to overwhelming emotional
  distress'

description: This meta-analysis of 18 studies found that depressed mood is significantly
  associated with deliberate self-harm in individuals with first-episode psychosis,
  with a moderate effect size (SMD=0.49). Depression consistently predicted DSH both
  before and after treatment initiation, suggesting a robust biological and psychological
  pathway. The meta-analysis identified depression as one of the key continuous variables
  associated with increased DSH risk, alongside younger age of onset and duration
  of untreated psychosis.
