direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption elevates blood alcohol concentration to 0.5 g/L (legal
  limit threshold)'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol acts on central nervous system, impairing psychomotor coordination
  and visual-spatial processing'
- 'Step 3: Impaired neurocognitive function reduces ability to maintain consistent
  lateral position within driving lane'
- 'Step 4: Reduced road tracking control manifests as increased standard deviation
  of lateral position (SDLP), indicating weaving behavior'
