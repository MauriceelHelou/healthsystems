- 'Step 1: Infection with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) such as Acinetobacter
  baumannii, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, or MRSA establishes in critically
  ill patients'
- 'Step 2: Limited antibiotic treatment options due to resistance patterns lead to
  delayed effective antimicrobial therapy and treatment failures'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged infection duration results in sustained inflammatory response,
  progressive organ dysfunction, and sepsis complications'
- 'Step 4: Severe infections by MDR pathogens contribute to increased ICU length of
  stay, need for mechanical ventilation, and multi-organ failure'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative physiological stress and inadequate infection control result
  in elevated mortality rates'

description: Multidrug-resistant organism infections in ICU patients are associated
  with increased mortality through multiple mechanisms including treatment failures
  due to limited antibiotic options, prolonged infection duration, enhanced inflammatory
  responses, and progressive organ dysfunction. Studies from the symposium abstracts
  document MDRO epidemiology in various ICU settings (P075-P079) and demonstrate that
  infections caused by extensively drug-resistant bacteria, including gram-negative
  bacilli, are associated with adverse outcomes. The use of immunomodulatory therapy
  such as IgM-enriched immunoglobulins has shown potential to improve survival in
  these patients.
