direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Vitamin D supplementation increases serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in
  COVID-19 patients'
- 'Step 2: Adequate vitamin D levels enhance innate immune function through cathelicidin
  and defensin production, improving antimicrobial defense against SARS-CoV-2'
- 'Step 3: Vitamin D modulates adaptive immune responses and reduces pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production, potentially attenuating the cytokine storm associated with
  severe COVID-19'
- 'Step 4: Reduced inflammation and improved immune regulation decrease disease severity
  and progression to critical illness'
- 'Step 5: Lower probability of respiratory deterioration requiring intensive care
  unit admission'

description: Meta-analysis of 5 RCTs demonstrates that vitamin D supplementation significantly
  reduces the risk of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20-0.39).
  Trial sequential analysis confirmed this association is conclusive with definitive
  sample size reached. The protective mechanism involves vitamin D's immunomodulatory
  effects, including enhanced innate immunity and reduced inflammatory responses.
