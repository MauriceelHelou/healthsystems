category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Long-term inhalation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) leads to chronic oxidative
  stress and systemic inflammation through reactive nitrogen species formation in
  respiratory tissues'
- 'Step 2: Persistent inflammation triggers endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis
  progression, and cardiovascular damage, while also causing chronic respiratory tissue
  injury'
- 'Step 3: These pathophysiological changes increase risk of death from multiple causes
  including cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, circulatory diseases),
  respiratory diseases (COPD, acute lower respiratory infections), and lung cancer'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative organ damage from chronic NO2 exposure results in elevated all-cause
  mortality risk'

description: Systematic review and meta-analysis of 83 cohort studies demonstrates
  that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide is associated with increased all-cause
  mortality. NO2 was significantly associated with mortality from all-causes, as well
  as specific causes including circulatory diseases, ischemic heart disease, COPD,
  acute lower respiratory infections, and lung cancer (but not cerebrovascular mortality).
  The GRADE assessment supports high certainty for associations with COPD and ALRI
  mortality.
