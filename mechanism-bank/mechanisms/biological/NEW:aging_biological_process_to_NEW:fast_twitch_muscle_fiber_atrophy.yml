direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Biological aging leads to preferential atrophy of fast-contracting (MyHC II and IIA) muscle
  fibers'
- 'Step 2: Fast-twitch fiber cross-sectional area decreases while slow-twitch (MyHC I) fiber size remains
  stable'
- 'Step 3: Relative protein expression shifts toward higher MyHC I and lower MyHC II/IIA isoforms'
- 'Step 4: This fiber-type specific atrophy contributes to sarcopenia (age-related muscle loss)'

description: Aging leads to selective atrophy of fast-contracting muscle fibers (MyHC II and IIA) while
  slow-contracting fibers (MyHC I) maintain their size. This results in a shift in protein expression
  toward slower isoforms, contributing to age-related loss in whole muscle force, velocity, and power
  (sarcopenia).

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This is primarily a biological mechanism. However, structural factors such as access
    to exercise facilities, physical activity opportunities in the built environment, and healthcare access
    for pharmacological interventions could modify the trajectory of sarcopenia. The finding that physical
    activity affects outcomes suggests that structural determinants of physical activity (park access,
    walkability, gym accessibility) are relevant upstream factors.
