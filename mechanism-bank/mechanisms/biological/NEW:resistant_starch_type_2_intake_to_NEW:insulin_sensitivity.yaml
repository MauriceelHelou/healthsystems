direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Resistant starch type 2 (RS2), characterized by high amylose concentration,
  escapes digestion by endogenous enzymes in the small intestine'
- 'Step 2: RS2 reaches the large intestine where it undergoes fermentation by gut
  microbiota, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)'
- 'Step 3: SCFAs and reduced glucose absorption lead to improved acute postprandial
  insulin response and lower insulin demands'
- 'Step 4: Chronic RS2 intake results in sustained improvements in fasting insulin
  levels and fasting glucose concentrations'
- 'Step 5: Reduced insulin secretion requirements and improved glucose homeostasis
  indicate enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity'

description: 'Resistant starch type 2 improves insulin sensitivity through multiple
  mechanisms. RS2 escapes small intestinal digestion due to its high amylose content,
  reducing acute glucose absorption and postprandial insulin demands. In chronic intake,
  RS2 significantly improves fasting insulin (SMD: -0.40) and fasting glucose (SMD:
  -0.39), indicating enhanced insulin sensitivity. The meta-analysis of 36 RCTs (n=982)
  demonstrates that RS2 also improves acute postprandial insulin response (SMD: -0.71),
  suggesting both immediate and sustained benefits for glucose homeostasis in individuals
  with T2D or prediabetes.'
