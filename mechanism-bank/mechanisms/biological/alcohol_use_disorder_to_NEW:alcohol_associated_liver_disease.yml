direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption in individuals with AUD leads to sustained hepatotoxic
  exposure'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species causing hepatocyte damage'
- 'Step 3: Repeated liver injury triggers inflammatory responses and fibrotic changes'
- 'Step 4: Progressive liver damage manifests as fatty liver, hepatitis, fibrosis, or cirrhosis'

description: This systematic review and meta-analysis of 35 studies found that alcohol-associated liver
  disease prevalence is dramatically higher among individuals with alcohol use disorder (51.0%) compared
  to general populations (3.5%) and primary care settings (2.6%), demonstrating the strong biological
  link between sustained alcohol consumption and liver pathology.

  description: Prevalence varies dramatically by setting - 51% in AUD populations vs 3.5% in unselected
    populations vs 2.6% in primary care
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While this mechanism documents the biological pathway from AUD to liver disease,
    structural factors including alcohol marketing, outlet density, pricing policies, and treatment access
    shape who develops AUD and who receives early intervention. The dramatic difference in prevalence
    between settings suggests opportunities for targeted case-finding in populations with AUD, which requires
    adequate funding and capacity for substance use treatment systems.
