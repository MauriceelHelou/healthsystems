direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure in AUD leads to neuroadaptations in the mesocorticolimbic reward system'
- 'Step 2: These neuroadaptations result in decreased activation of the ventral striatum during anticipation
  of monetary (non-drug) rewards'
- 'Step 3: Reduced ventral striatum response reflects blunted sensitivity to natural rewards'
- 'Step 4: This reward deficit may perpetuate alcohol-seeking behavior as the primary source of reward
  activation'

description: Alcohol use disorder is associated with decreased ventral striatum activation during monetary
  reward anticipation, reflecting neurobiological changes in reward processing that may contribute to
  maintained alcohol-seeking behavior through reduced sensitivity to natural rewards.

  description: Different activation patterns observed during anticipation versus outcome stages, suggesting
    stage-specific neural alterations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals neurobiological consequences of AUD that may perpetuate
    the disorder. Understanding these neural changes is critical for developing targeted interventions
    and challenges individual-blame narratives by demonstrating how the disorder fundamentally alters
    brain reward circuitry.
