direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Routine and manual workers face greater workplace precarity, time constraints,
  and lower autonomy compared to professional/managerial staff'
- 'Step 2: These structural workplace conditions create barriers to participation
  in voluntary health interventions during work time'
- 'Step 3: Concerns about confidentiality and potential employment consequences may
  be heightened among workers with less job security'
- 'Step 4: Lower digital literacy and limited access to workplace computers among
  manual workers creates additional structural barriers to online interventions'
