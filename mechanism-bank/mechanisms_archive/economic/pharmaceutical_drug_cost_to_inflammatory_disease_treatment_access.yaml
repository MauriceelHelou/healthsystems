direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Existing anti-inflammatory therapeutic drugs have high costs that create
  economic barriers to access'
- 'Step 2: High drug costs limit treatment availability for low-income populations
  and in resource-limited settings'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to anti-inflammatory treatment leads to uncontrolled inflammatory
  responses'
- 'Step 4: Uncontrolled inflammation triggers inflammatory cascades that threaten
  human and animal health'
