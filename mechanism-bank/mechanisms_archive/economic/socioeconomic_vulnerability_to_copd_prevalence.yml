  node_id: copd_prevalence

direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic disadvantage limits access to quality housing in areas with better air quality'
- 'Step 2: Lower income restricts access to preventive healthcare and early respiratory care'
- 'Step 3: Economic stress increases exposure to occupational and environmental respiratory hazards'
- 'Step 4: Limited resources for health-promoting behaviors and environments increase respiratory disease
  risk'

  description: River valley regions show stronger associations between socioeconomic vulnerability and
    COPD
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural economic inequities that determine residential
    location options and healthcare access. It demonstrates how economic systems create differential exposure
    to respiratory hazards and barriers to preventive care, avoiding individual blame by focusing on systemic
    constraints.
