- 'Step 1: Small employers (under 100 workers) constitute 97.5% of all establishments
  but have limited financial and administrative capacity'
- 'Step 2: Resource constraints reduce ability to offer comprehensive employee benefits
  including mental health support programs'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) and behavioral health
  resources leaves workers without workplace-based mental health support'
- 'Step 4: Lack of accessible workplace mental health services during COVID-19 pandemic
  leads to unaddressed behavioral health needs'
