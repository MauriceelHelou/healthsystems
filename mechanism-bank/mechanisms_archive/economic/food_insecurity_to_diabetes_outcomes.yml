category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Household food insecurity forces trade-offs between food and medications, leading to cost-related
  medication non-adherence'
- 'Step 2: Limited food budgets result in consumption of calorie-dense but nutrient-poor foods, impairing
  glycemic control'
- 'Step 3: Cyclical food availability causes feast-famine eating patterns that destabilize blood glucose
  levels'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress from food uncertainty elevates cortisol, directly worsening insulin resistance'
- 'Step 5: Poor glycemic control leads to diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy,
  and nephropathy'

description: Food insecurity undermines diabetes management through multiple pathways including medication-food
  trade-offs, poor diet quality, irregular eating patterns, and chronic stress. This mechanism disproportionately
  affects low-income populations and contributes to diabetes complications and mortality.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: economic_system
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Food insecurity reflects structural economic inequality and food system failures.
    Marginalized communities face higher food insecurity rates due to wage stagnation, inadequate safety
    net programs, food apartheid in low-income neighborhoods, and systemic barriers to economic mobility.
    Framing this as individual dietary choice ignores these structural determinants.
assumptions:
- Assumes continuous or recurrent food insecurity rather than temporary shortage
- Food insecurity measured using USDA 18-item or 6-item screening tools
- Diabetes outcomes include A1C, complications, and hospitalizations
limitations:
- Many studies are cross-sectional limiting causal inference
- Food insecurity measurement varies across studies
- Confounding by overall socioeconomic status difficult to fully address
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Food insecurity prevalence varies by region, with higher rates in rural areas and food
    deserts. Local food assistance infrastructure and state SNAP policies create geographic variation
    in effect magnitude.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas with limited food retail access show stronger effects
  - States with restricted SNAP eligibility show higher food insecurity-diabetes burden
  - Urban food deserts concentrate unhealthy food environments
