  node_name: Unmet Healthcare Needs for Mental Health and Substance Use
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic marginalization creates multiple interconnected deprivations
  including income insecurity, housing instability, and social exclusion'
- 'Step 2: These deprivations reduce capacity to navigate healthcare systems, afford
  transportation, take time off for appointments, and maintain continuity with providers'
- 'Step 3: Marginalization also increases exposure to stigma and discrimination within
  healthcare settings, creating additional barriers to seeking and receiving care'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated structural disadvantages result in higher rates of unmet healthcare
  needs despite equal or greater need for mental health and substance use services'

- name: housing_stability
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Greater housing stability partially buffers against some impacts of
    socioeconomic marginalization on healthcare access, though substantial housing
    instability itself increases odds of unmet needs (aOR=2.37)
- name: drug_dependence_severity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: More severe drug dependence compounds the impact of socioeconomic marginalization
    on unmet healthcare needs
