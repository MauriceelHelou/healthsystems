mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Micro-costing analysis documents comprehensive resource requirements including
  staff salaries, training, materials, and administrative activities needed to deliver
  ABI in criminal justice settings'
- 'Step 2: Higher implementation costs create financial barriers for resource-constrained
  prison health services and criminal justice budgets'
- 'Step 3: Cost information influences policy decisions about allocation of limited
  public health and criminal justice funding'
- 'Step 4: Economic feasibility determines whether interventions can be sustained
  beyond pilot implementation and scaled across multiple prison facilities'
