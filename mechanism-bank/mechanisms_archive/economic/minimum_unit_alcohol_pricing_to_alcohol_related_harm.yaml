direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimum unit pricing policy establishes a floor price per unit of alcohol,
  directly increasing the cost of cheaper alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices create an economic barrier to purchasing alcohol, particularly
  affecting consumption of low-cost, high-strength products commonly available in
  informal alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption, especially among heavy drinkers who disproportionately
  consume cheaper alcohol, leads to decreased alcohol-attributable health outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Population-level reduction in alcohol consumption results in reduced alcohol-related
  harm including both health and economic consequences'

  description: Civil society organizations with lived experience of informal alcohol
    outlets provided input suggesting these outlets are critical contexts where minimum
    unit pricing would operate, potentially strengthening the mechanism's effect in
    communities with high informal outlet density

    suggesting the mechanism may operate differently across demographic and socioeconomic
    groups, with potential for stronger effects among heavy drinkers who consume cheaper
