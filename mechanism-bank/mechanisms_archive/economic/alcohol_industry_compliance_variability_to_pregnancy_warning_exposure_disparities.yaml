direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry demonstrates differential compliance with warning label
  requirements across product categories'
- 'Step 2: Spirits producers show lowest compliance (50%) compared to beer (83%) and
  other beverages (91%)'
- 'Step 3: Consumers who preferentially purchase spirits have substantially lower
  exposure to pregnancy warnings'
- 'Step 4: Differential exposure creates health information inequities based on alcohol
  product preferences'
