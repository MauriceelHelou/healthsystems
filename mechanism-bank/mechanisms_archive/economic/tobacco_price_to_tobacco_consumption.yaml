direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Price increases make tobacco products less affordable for consumers'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints reduce both the decision to participate in tobacco
  purchasing (participation elasticity) and the quantity purchased by existing consumers
  (consumption elasticity)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced purchasing and consumption of tobacco occurs across disaggregated
  product categories'
- 'Step 4: Overall population-level tobacco consumption decreases as shown by negative
  own-price elasticities'
