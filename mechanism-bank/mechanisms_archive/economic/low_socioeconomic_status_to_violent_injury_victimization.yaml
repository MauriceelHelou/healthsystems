direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low socioeconomic status concentrates individuals in neighborhoods with
  limited resources, reduced police protection, and higher crime rates'
- 'Step 2: Economic marginalization reduces access to safe housing, employment opportunities,
  and violence prevention services'
- 'Step 3: Structural disinvestment in low-SES communities creates conditions where
  interpersonal violence is more prevalent'
- 'Step 4: Individuals in low-SES contexts face disproportionate exposure to violent
  injury requiring trauma center admission'
