direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased excise taxation raises the retail price of alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices reduce affordability and economic accessibility of alcohol,
  particularly for price-sensitive populations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption due to price effects decreases population exposure
  to alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Lower alcohol consumption results in decreased alcohol-attributable mortality
  across the population'
