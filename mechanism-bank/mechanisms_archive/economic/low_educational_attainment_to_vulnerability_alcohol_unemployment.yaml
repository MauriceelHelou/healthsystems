direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low educational attainment restricts access to occupations with job security,
  workplace protections, and employment benefits'
- 'Step 2: Low-educated workers are concentrated in precarious employment sectors
  with strict performance monitoring and limited tolerance for health problems'
- 'Step 3: These jobs lack accommodations for workers experiencing health issues,
  including alcohol problems'
- 'Step 4: When alcohol problems emerge, low-educated workers face 50% higher risk
  of unemployment compared to similar workers without alcohol problems'
