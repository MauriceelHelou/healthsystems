- 'Step 2: Lack of job security generates persistent anxiety about work continuity'

- 'Step 4: Algorithmic management and surveillance increase work pace and reduce autonomy'
- 'Step 5: Social isolation from transient work relationships eliminates workplace social support'

description: Precarious employment, including gig work, zero-hours contracts, and temporary positions, systematically harms mental health through multiple pathways. Qualitative research identifies four core experiences - financial instability, temporal uncertainty, marginal status, and employment insecurity - each connected with multiple interrelated mechanisms leading to anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion.

  equity_implications: Precarious employment disproportionately affects young workers, immigrants, and racial/ethnic minorities who face barriers to standard employment. The rise of the gig economy has shifted risk from employers to workers while maintaining employer control through algorithmic management. Policy solutions should address worker classification, portable benefits, and social protection coverage.
assumptions:
- Precarious employment includes gig work, temporary contracts, and involuntary part-time
- Mental health outcomes include depression, anxiety, and psychological distress
- Mechanism operates through economic and psychosocial pathways
limitations:
- Selection effects may confound estimates (people with mental health conditions may be more likely to enter precarious work)
- Cross-national variation in labor market protections affects generalizability
- Rapid changes in gig economy regulation may alter relationships
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Impact varies by national labor market regulations and social protection systems
  relevant_geographies:
  - Countries with strong social protection (Nordic) show weaker effects
  - United States lacks universal healthcare, amplifying mental health impacts
  - Urban areas have higher concentration of gig economy work
