direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol consumption and problem drinking impair cognitive function,
  work performance, and reliability in occupational settings'
- 'Step 2: Low and medium-educated workers face stricter workplace monitoring and
  less job security, making performance issues more likely to result in job loss'
- 'Step 3: Employers in sectors employing lower-educated workers have less tolerance
  for alcohol-related absenteeism or performance problems'
- 'Step 4: Job loss occurs through termination or inability to maintain employment
  standards, creating transition to unemployment'
