mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural factors including poverty, economic marginalization, and inadequate
  social safety nets create material deprivation and stress'
- 'Step 2: Lack of affordable housing supply and employment discrimination limit housing
  stability and income security'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate access to mental health and addiction treatment services leaves
  underlying conditions unaddressed'
- 'Step 4: These shared structural vulnerabilities simultaneously increase risk for
  both homelessness and substance use, creating observed correlation without direct
  causation between the two'
