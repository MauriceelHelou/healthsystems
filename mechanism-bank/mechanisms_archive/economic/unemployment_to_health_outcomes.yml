- 'Step 1: Job loss eliminates income, creating immediate financial stress and economic insecurity'
- 'Step 2: Loss of employer-sponsored health insurance reduces healthcare access and utilization'
- 'Step 3: Financial strain forces trade-offs between basic needs (food, housing, medications)'
- 'Step 4: Unemployment-related stress, loss of purpose, and social isolation impact mental health'
- 'Step 5: Combined physical and mental health decline manifests as chronic disease, disability, and mortality'

description: Unemployment and job loss are associated with worse health outcomes including increased mortality,
  chronic disease progression, and mental health disorders. Persons with chronic conditions reduce working
  hours significantly (6.78 hours/week for men, 3.97 hours/week for women), representing substantial productivity
  losses. The relationship is bidirectional, with health affecting employment and employment affecting
  health.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: economic_system
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Unemployment reflects labor market conditions, automation, deindustrialization,
    and economic cycles - not individual failings. The health consequences of unemployment are predictable
    outcomes of tying health insurance to employment and inadequate social safety net. Policies including
    universal healthcare, robust unemployment insurance, and job guarantees address root causes.
assumptions:
- Unemployment defined as involuntary job loss or inability to find work
- Health outcomes include both physical health (chronic disease, mortality) and mental health
- Assumes baseline employed population comparison
limitations:
- Selection effects (unhealthy individuals more likely to become unemployed)
- Difficult to establish causation in observational studies
- Context-dependent effects based on social safety net strength
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Unemployment health effects vary based on social safety net strength, healthcare system,
    and labor market conditions.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Countries with universal healthcare show weaker unemployment-health link
  - US shows strong effects due to employer-sponsored insurance system
  - Regions with high unemployment normalize joblessness, potentially buffering individual effects
