direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unemployment bonuses and other pandemic relief measures increased disposable
  incomes for many households'
- 'Step 2: Higher disposable income relaxes budget constraints for all consumption
  including alcohol and drugs'
- 'Step 3: Income effects induce shifts toward cheaper, more dangerous substances
  (e.g., shift to fentanyl from other opioids)'
- 'Step 4: Increased consumption and shift to more dangerous substances increases
  overdose risk and mortality'
