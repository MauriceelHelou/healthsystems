to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_attributable_mortality
  node_name: Alcohol-Attributable Mortality
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low household income creates material deprivation and financial stress
  that affect living conditions, nutrition, and access to healthcare'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints limit ability to access preventive health services,
  addiction treatment, and quality medical care for alcohol-related conditions'
- 'Step 3: Low-income neighborhoods may have higher alcohol outlet density and fewer
  health-promoting resources, increasing exposure to alcohol harm'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative economic disadvantage and stress contribute to higher mortality
  from alcohol-attributable causes including chronic diseases and acute injuries'
