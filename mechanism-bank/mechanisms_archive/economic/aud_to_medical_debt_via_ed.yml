mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: AUD increases emergency department utilization through acute intoxication, withdrawal, injuries,
  and alcohol-attributable diseases'
- 'Step 2: Uninsured or underinsured individuals with AUD receive ED care generating large facility and
  professional service bills'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related hospitalizations for cirrhosis, pancreatitis, or withdrawal produce catastrophic
  medical costs ($20,000-$100,000+ per admission)'
- 'Step 4: Inability to pay medical bills leads to medical debt, collections, damaged credit, and wage
  garnishment'
- 'Step 5: Medical debt compounds economic hardship, forcing tradeoffs between healthcare, housing, food,
  and other needs'

  equity_implications: 'Medical debt from AUD is not inevitable but reflects US policy choice to tie healthcare
    access to employment and commodify medical care. Other nations with universal healthcare eliminate
    alcohol-related medical debt entirely. Uninsured rates concentrate in states refusing Medicaid expansion,
    disproportionately harming low-income communities of color. Emergency departments become site of debt
    generation rather than healing for uninsured patients. Hospital price opacity and aggressive collections
    compound harm. The AUD-medical debt pathway represents how privatized healthcare transforms health
    crises into financial catastrophes. High medical debt in communities affected by addiction reflects
    deliberate policy choices against universal coverage. Addressing this requires: Medicare for All,
    Medicaid expansion, hospital price regulation, charity care enforcement, and ending medical debt collections.'
assumptions:
- Assumes AUD severity producing multiple ED visits and hospitalizations
- Medical debt accumulation requires lack of adequate insurance coverage
- Mechanism captures direct medical costs, not indirect costs (lost wages, etc.)
limitations:
- Insured individuals with AUD may face minimal debt depending on coverage
- Some hospital systems provide generous charity care reducing debt burden
- Medical debt impact varies by state Medicaid policies and hospital billing practices
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Medical debt from alcohol-related care varies dramatically by insurance coverage and
    state Medicaid policies
  relevant_geographies:
  - Medicaid non-expansion states show highest medical debt from alcohol-related care
  - Rural areas with limited treatment options rely more heavily on costly ED care
  - States with strong hospital charity care requirements reduce debt burden
  - Urban safety-net hospitals in expansion states provide Medicaid enrollment and coverage
