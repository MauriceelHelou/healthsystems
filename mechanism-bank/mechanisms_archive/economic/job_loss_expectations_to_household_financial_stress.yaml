direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workers accurately predict probability of job loss in next 12 months, particularly
  when job loss leads to unemployment'
- 'Step 2: Higher job loss expectations trigger precautionary financial behaviors
  including increased savings and reduced risky asset exposure'
- 'Step 3: Households reduce durable consumption expenditures (acquiring cheaper cars,
  avoiding new car purchases)'
- 'Step 4: These financial constraints and consumption restrictions create sustained
  household financial stress'
