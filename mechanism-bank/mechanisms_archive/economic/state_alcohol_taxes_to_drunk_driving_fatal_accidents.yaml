direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State-level alcohol taxation increases retail price of alcoholic beverages,
  creating economic barrier to alcohol purchase'
- 'Step 2: Higher alcohol prices reduce alcohol consumption at population level, particularly
  among price-sensitive consumers including youth and lower-income individuals'
- 'Step 3: Reduced overall alcohol consumption decreases prevalence of alcohol-impaired
  driving occasions in the population'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of drunk-driving behavior result in reduced fatal accident
  rates involving alcohol-impaired drivers'
