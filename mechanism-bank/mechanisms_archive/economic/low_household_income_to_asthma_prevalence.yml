direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low household income limits financial resources available for housing maintenance and repair'
- 'Step 2: Inability to afford repairs leads to deteriorating housing conditions including moisture, mold,
  and structural problems'
- 'Step 3: Poor housing quality creates indoor air quality problems and allergen exposure'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure to poor indoor air quality and allergens triggers and exacerbates respiratory
  conditions'

  involving housing quality deterioration and indoor environmental exposures

  description: Manufactured homes, which comprised over half of homes in the study, may have particular
    vulnerability to deterioration and indoor air quality issues
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how economic inequality directly translates to health
    disparities through housing pathways. The concentration of low-income households in the Alabama Black
    Belt reflects historical patterns of racial and economic marginalization. The mechanism avoids individual
    blame and focuses on systemic economic constraints that limit housing options.
