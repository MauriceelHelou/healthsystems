- 'Step 1: AUD produces cognitive impairment, reduced productivity, and increased absenteeism affecting
  job performance'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-related health problems cause missed work, medical appointments, and unreliability'
- 'Step 3: Workplace incidents, conflicts with coworkers/supervisors, or intoxication at work trigger
  disciplinary actions'
- 'Step 4: Progressive job performance deterioration leads to termination or forced resignation'
- 'Step 5: Untreated AUD creates barriers to reemployment through poor references, gaps in work history,
  and ongoing impairment'

  equity_implications: 'Employment loss from AUD reflects both disease impact and institutional failures
    in workplace support and healthcare access. Workers in precarious employment lack sick leave, EAP
    access, and job protections that enable treatment. Low-wage workers are terminated for attendance
    while executives receive private rehabilitation referrals. Racial discrimination compounds AUD-related
    job loss for workers of color. Criminal justice involvement from addiction creates permanent employment
    barriers. The AUD-unemployment pathway operates within broader context of employment precarity, inadequate
    addiction treatment, and punitive rather than supportive workplace responses. High job loss in workers
    with AUD reflects policy choices about employment protections, universal healthcare access, paid sick
    leave, and workplace culture. Interrupting this cycle requires: mandatory EAPs, job-protected treatment
    leave, universal addiction coverage, ban-the-box policies, and challenging workplace cultures that
    stigmatize rather than support recovery.'
assumptions:
- AUD severity sufficient to impair work functioning (moderate-severe)
- Mechanism assumes limited workplace accommodation and treatment access
- Job loss encompasses both termination and functional unemployment from impairment
limitations:
- Many individuals with AUD maintain employment; severity and occupation matter
- Early intervention and treatment can prevent job loss trajectory
- Selection into certain occupations/industries may precede AUD development
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Employment protections, EAP availability, and treatment access vary substantially affecting
    AUD-related job loss
  relevant_geographies:
  - States with stronger worker protections show lower AUD-related job loss
  - Union jobs provide better EAP access and due process protections
  - Rural areas with limited treatment options show worse employment retention
  - Regions with robust Medicaid allow treatment without employment-based insurance dependency
