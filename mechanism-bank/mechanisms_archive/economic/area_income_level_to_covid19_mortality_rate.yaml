- 'Step 1: Higher income areas have greater economic resources enabling pandemic mitigation
  strategies including ability to work from home, access to protective equipment,
  and physical distancing capacity'
- 'Step 2: Income enables access to higher quality healthcare including private insurance,
  proximity to well-resourced medical facilities, and ability to seek early treatment'
- 'Step 3: Higher income neighborhoods have better built environment features including
  lower density housing, more space for isolation, and reduced crowding that limits
  viral transmission'
- 'Step 4: Economic resources provide buffer against occupational exposure through
  ability to avoid essential worker roles and access paid leave during illness'
