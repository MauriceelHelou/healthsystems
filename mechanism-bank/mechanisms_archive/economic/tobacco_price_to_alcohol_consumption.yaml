direction: unclear
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Changes in tobacco prices affect household budget constraints and economic
  decisions'
- 'Step 2: Cross-price elasticity effects occur between tobacco and alcohol as potentially
  complementary or substitute goods'
- 'Step 3: Budget reallocation decisions may lead to changes in alcohol purchasing
  patterns'
- 'Step 4: Net effect on alcohol consumption depends on whether products are complements
  (consumed together) or substitutes, which shows no consistent pattern'
