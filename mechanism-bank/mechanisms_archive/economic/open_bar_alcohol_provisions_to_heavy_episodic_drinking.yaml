direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry includes open bar (free alcohol) provisions in 81% of
  sponsorship agreements with university sports clubs'
- 'Step 2: Free alcohol events eliminate financial constraints on consumption, removing
  a key protective factor that limits drinking quantity'
- 'Step 3: Social dynamics of free alcohol events create peer pressure and social
  norms favoring heavy consumption within time-limited windows'
- 'Step 4: Repeated exposure to open bar events establishes patterns of heavy episodic
  drinking during university social events'
