direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher beer excise taxes increase the retail price of alcoholic beverages,
  creating economic barriers to purchase'
- 'Step 2: Price increases disproportionately affect youth populations who have limited
  disposable income and are more price-sensitive than adult consumers'
- 'Step 3: Economic constraints reduce the volume and frequency of alcohol purchases
  by or on behalf of underage youth'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol availability through economic mechanisms decreases opportunities
  for binge drinking during adolescence, preventing escalating consumption patterns
  into early adulthood'
