  node_name: Adverse Financial and Employment Changes During COVID-19 Lockdown
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low socioeconomic position concentrates individuals in precarious employment
  sectors (service, retail, hospitality) with low job security and limited remote
  work options'
- 'Step 2: COVID-19 lockdown policies mandate closure of non-essential businesses
  and reduce economic activity in sectors employing low-wage workers'
- 'Step 3: Workers in low SEP have minimal financial buffers (savings, assets) to
  weather employment disruptions'
- 'Step 4: Job loss and income reduction occur disproportionately among low SEP workers,
  exacerbating pre-existing financial vulnerability'
