direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Growing income inequality creates differential access to health-promoting
  resources, preventive care, and medical innovations'
- 'Step 2: Low-income populations experience concentrated disadvantage across multiple
  domains (housing, neighborhood environment, healthcare access)'
- 'Step 3: Stagnation in mortality improvements is concentrated among disadvantaged
  groups while higher-income groups continue to benefit from health advances'
- 'Step 4: Widening mortality gaps by income contribute to overall population-level
  stagnation in life expectancy gains'
