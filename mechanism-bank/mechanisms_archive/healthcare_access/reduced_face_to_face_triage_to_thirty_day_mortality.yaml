  node_name: 30-Day Mortality After Medical Helpline Call
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telephone triage decision against face-to-face contact prevents direct
  physical examination and diagnostic testing'
- 'Step 2: Serious conditions requiring immediate intervention may be missed or underestimated
  without in-person assessment'
- 'Step 3: Delayed diagnosis and treatment initiation allows disease progression during
  critical time windows'
- 'Step 4: Patients with unrecognized serious conditions deteriorate at home without
  appropriate medical monitoring'
- 'Step 5: Increased risk of mortality within 30 days due to missed or delayed critical
  interventions'
