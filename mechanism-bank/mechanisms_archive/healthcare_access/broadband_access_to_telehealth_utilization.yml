description: Broadband internet access is a critical infrastructure requirement for telehealth utilization. During the COVID-19 pandemic, counties with higher broadband availability had substantially higher rates of telehealth use (47% higher in highest vs. lowest quintile). A standard deviation increase in broadband access was associated with a 1.54 percentage point increase in telehealth utilization among Medicare beneficiaries. Broadband has been identified as a "super determinant" of health that enables access to healthcare services, particularly for rural and underserved populations facing provider shortages.

  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Digital divide reflects structural underinvestment in broadband infrastructure for rural and low-income communities. An estimated 19 million Americans lack reliable broadband access. Telehealth disparities are not individual technology failures but infrastructure policy choices. Federal broadband investment (IIJA 2021) represents structural intervention to address this determinant.
assumptions:
- Assumes telehealth is clinically appropriate alternative for some care
- Assumes providers offer telehealth services when patients have access
- Assumes broadband speed is sufficient for video visits
limitations:
- COVID-19 pandemic context may not generalize to post-pandemic
- Cross-sectional design limits causal inference
- Broadband access does not address all telehealth barriers (digital literacy, device ownership)
- Telehealth not appropriate for all healthcare needs
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Broadband availability varies dramatically between urban, suburban, and rural areas
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas face greatest broadband gaps and would benefit most from infrastructure investment
  - Tribal areas have particularly low broadband availability
  - Low-income urban areas may have infrastructure but affordability barriers
