mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different transplant centers implement different sobriety requirement policies
  (early vs 6-month delayed eligibility)'
- 'Step 2: Patients in regions with early transplantation policies have immediate
  access to waitlist placement'
- 'Step 3: Patients in regions requiring 6-month sobriety face structural delay in
  accessing transplant eligibility'
- 'Step 4: Geographic location determines survival probability independent of clinical
  factors (MELD and Lille scores)'
