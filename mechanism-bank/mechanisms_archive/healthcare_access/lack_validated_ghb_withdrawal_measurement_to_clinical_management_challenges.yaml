direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: No validated measurement tools exist specifically for assessing severity
  of GHB withdrawal syndrome'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians lack standardized protocols for guiding treatment decisions
  and medication dosing during GHB withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: Absence of validated tools creates uncertainty in clinical decision-making
  for benzodiazepine dosing'
- 'Step 4: This gap in clinical infrastructure increases risk of inadequate or excessive
  treatment during withdrawal management'
