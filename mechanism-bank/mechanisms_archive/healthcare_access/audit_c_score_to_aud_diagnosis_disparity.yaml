direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Veterans complete AUDIT-C screening which objectively measures alcohol
  consumption levels across racial/ethnic groups'
- 'Step 2: Despite similar AUDIT-C scores indicating equivalent alcohol consumption,
  minoritized veterans are subject to differential clinical interpretation and follow-up
  assessment'
- 'Step 3: Structural biases lead clinicians to weigh other subjective factors more
  heavily for Black and Hispanic veterans, resulting in diagnosis at lower consumption
  thresholds'
- 'Step 4: The persistence of diagnostic disparities even after controlling for AUDIT-C
  scores demonstrates that standardized screening tools alone cannot eliminate bias
  when downstream diagnostic decisions remain subject to racialized clinical judgment'
