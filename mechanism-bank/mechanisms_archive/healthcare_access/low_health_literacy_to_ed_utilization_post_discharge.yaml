direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gun violence survivors feel unable to read or comprehend written discharge
  instructions from trauma center'
- 'Step 2: Inability to understand discharge instructions leads to confusion about
  wound care, medication regimens, warning signs, and follow-up appointments'
- 'Step 3: Survivors lack clear guidance on managing recovery at home and recognizing
  when to seek care versus self-manage'
- 'Step 4: Preventable complications occur or anxiety about symptoms leads to emergency
  department visits that could have been avoided with comprehensible instructions'
