mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Only 9.8% of Black adults with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension
  receive mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists despite American Heart Association
  recommendations'
- 'Step 2: 90.2% treatment gap results in suboptimal management of resistant hypertension
  in Black population'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate pharmacological control of blood pressure increases cardiovascular
  disease risk in high-risk population'
- 'Step 4: Elevated risk profile leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
