direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher severity of alcohol use increases awareness and experience of treatment
  system limitations'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with severe AUD may have had previous negative experiences
  with treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Treatment services may be inadequately designed for complex, severe cases'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers in service delivery (accessibility, wait times, service
  quality) are more salient to those with severe conditions'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated barriers reduce treatment seeking among those with highest
  severity'
