mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Community-based medications first model provides low-barrier drop-in access
  to MOUD in harm reduction and homeless services settings, removing structural barriers
  present in traditional opioid treatment programs'
- 'Step 2: Expanded access enables individuals who previously faced difficulty engaging
  in traditional healthcare settings to initiate and maintain MOUD treatment'
- 'Step 3: Consistent MOUD treatment reduces risk of fatal overdose by preventing
  physiological opioid withdrawal and reducing illicit opioid use'
- 'Step 4: Decreased mortality results from medication stabilization and ongoing engagement
  with supportive services'
