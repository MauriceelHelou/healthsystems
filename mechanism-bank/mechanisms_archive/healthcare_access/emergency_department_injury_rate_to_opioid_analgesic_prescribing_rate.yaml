direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher injury rates indicate greater population-level pain management needs
  and acute care utilization'
- 'Step 2: Emergency departments serve as primary point of care for injuries in areas
  with limited primary care access'
- 'Step 3: Acute care settings have higher propensity for opioid prescribing for pain
  management compared to longitudinal primary care'
- 'Step 4: Structural factors that increase injury rates (occupational hazards, unsafe
  environments) drive opioid prescribing patterns'
