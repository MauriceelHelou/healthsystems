direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate public health communication and service promotion creates information
  gaps about where and how to access help for crystal methamphetamine use'
- 'Step 2: Limited health literacy resources and fragmented service systems make navigation
  difficult even when services exist'
- 'Step 3: Lack of knowledge is particularly pronounced in communities with limited
  healthcare infrastructure or among populations facing digital divides'
- 'Step 4: Information gaps prevent initial help-seeking attempts, delaying access
  to treatment and support'

  description: Health workers showed decreased odds (OR 0.69) of reporting attitudinal
    compared to knowledge barriers, suggesting knowledge barriers may be more salient
    for healthcare providers than for people with lived experience
