direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transplant programs implement mandatory 6-month abstinence requirement
  as eligibility criterion'
- 'Step 2: Patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis experience rapid disease
  progression and high short-term mortality'
- 'Step 3: Six-month waiting period excludes patients who are non-responsive to steroid
  therapy during first episode of severe decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Systematic exclusion prevents access to potentially life-saving liver transplantation
  for eligible candidates'

    of the six-month rule, as these patients have no alternative treatment options
    and face high mortality

  description: Centers with comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment teams (hepatologist,
    surgeon, psychologist, psychiatrist) may be more likely to consider exceptions
    to the six-month rule
