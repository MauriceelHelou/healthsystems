mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Care delivery interventions modify treatment structures to increase pharmacotherapy
  access'
- 'Step 2: Increased pharmacotherapy receipt provides patients with evidence-based
  medication treatment'
- 'Step 3: Medication treatment affects neurobiological pathways related to alcohol
  dependence and craving'
- 'Step 4: Changes in alcohol consumption patterns result from pharmacological and
  care delivery effects'

  description: Only one of three care delivery interventions that increased medication
    receipt also improved alcohol use outcomes, suggesting medication receipt alone
    is insufficient
