direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carceral healthcare systems operate within institutional environments shaped
  by correctional priorities, resource constraints, and potentially differential treatment
  protocols'
- 'Step 2: For individuals initiating MOUD during incarceration, treatment decisions
  occur within the context of institutional power dynamics and provider-patient relationships
  influenced by carceral settings'
- 'Step 3: Structural factors within carceral healthcare (e.g., medication availability,
  provider training, institutional protocols, implicit biases) interact with race
  to shape treatment type selection'
- 'Step 4: Non-White individuals initiating MOUD during incarceration demonstrate
  higher likelihood of buprenorphine selection compared to White counterparts, suggesting
  racialized treatment pathways specific to carceral settings'

  description: The interaction between race and MOUD treatment type is specifically
    significant among those initiating treatment during incarceration, not among those
    continuing community-based treatment, indicating that carceral initiation context
    fundamentally moderates racialized treatment patterns
