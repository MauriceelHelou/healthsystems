mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Carceral facilities implement medication-assisted treatment programs providing
  MOUD (buprenorphine or methadone) to incarcerated individuals with opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Incarceration creates a controlled healthcare environment where systematic
  screening and treatment initiation can occur'
- 'Step 3: Individuals who may have faced barriers to MOUD access in community settings
  gain structured access to treatment during incarceration'
- 'Step 4: Treatment is provided through institutional medical records and healthcare
  delivery systems within correctional facilities'
