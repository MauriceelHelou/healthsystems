mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Psychiatric inpatient settings provide structured environment for comprehensive
  medical evaluation and observation'
- 'Step 2: Implementation of systematic two-stage screening protocols enables identification
  of patients meeting Caine criteria (nutritional deficiency, delirium/memory impairment,
  cerebellar dysfunction, oculomotor abnormalities)'
- 'Step 3: Screening identifies 12% prevalence of Caine-positive WKS among psychiatric
  admissions, much higher than would be detected using classic triad criteria (encephalopathy,
  ataxia, ophthalmoplegia)'
- 'Step 4: Early detection enables prompt high-dose thiamine treatment initiation,
  preventing progression to irreversible neurological damage'
