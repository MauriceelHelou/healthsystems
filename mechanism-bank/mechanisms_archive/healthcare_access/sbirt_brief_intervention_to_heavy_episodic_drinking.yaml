direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SBIRT programs screen for and intervene on overall alcohol consumption
  levels'
- 'Step 2: Brief interventions focus on quantity and frequency of drinking rather
  than drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Reduction in overall consumption does not necessarily address binge drinking
  behaviors or episodic heavy use'
- 'Step 4: Heavy episodic drinking prevalence remains unchanged despite reductions
  in total alcohol consumption'
