  node_name: Vascular Purpura in EGPA
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Torasemide, a sulfonamide-derivative loop diuretic, is prescribed for blood
  pressure management in patients with underlying EGPA predisposition'
- 'Step 2: Chemical similarity to sulfonamides (known EGPA triggering drugs) leads
  to drug-induced immune activation'
- 'Step 3: Acute onset of perivascular infiltrates consisting of eosinophils and neutrophils
  with fibrinous necrosis of small vessels'
- 'Step 4: Development of purpura-like skin lesions progressing from ankles upward
  within 7 days of drug initiation'
