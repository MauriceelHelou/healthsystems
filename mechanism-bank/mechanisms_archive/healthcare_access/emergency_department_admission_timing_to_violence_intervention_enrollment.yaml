mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Encouraging nurses to enter HVIP consults at the time of emergency department
  admission creates a systematic touchpoint early in the care process'
- 'Step 2: Early initiation of referrals prevents consults from being forgotten or
  deprioritized during busy emergency department workflow'
- 'Step 3: Timely referrals while patients are still in the emergency department increase
  the likelihood of patient contact and consent for program enrollment'
- 'Step 4: Earlier connection to violence intervention specialists improves enrollment
  rates and initiation of comprehensive services'
