mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability reduces access to routine and preventive cardiovascular care'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing complicates medication management and adherence for cardiovascular conditions'
- 'Step 3: Delayed or inadequate routine care leads to acute exacerbations of cardiovascular disease'
- 'Step 4: Emergency departments become primary source of care due to barriers accessing routine services'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how housing instability forces individuals into costly,
    inappropriate healthcare utilization patterns. The shift from preventive to emergency care reflects
    structural failures in both housing and healthcare systems, creating inefficient resource use while
    perpetuating health inequities.
