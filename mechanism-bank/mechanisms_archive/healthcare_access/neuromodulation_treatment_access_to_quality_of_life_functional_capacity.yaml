mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems provide access to neuromodulatory techniques (electrical
  stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, dorsal root ganglion stimulation) for patients
  with diabetic peripheral neuropathy'
- 'Step 2: Neuromodulation treatments reduce chronic neuropathic pain symptoms that
  are refractory to standard pharmacologic treatments'
- 'Step 3: Pain reduction enables improved mobility, sleep, and daily functioning'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced functional capacity and reduced pain burden lead to improved overall
  quality of life'
