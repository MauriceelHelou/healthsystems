category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Online training provides clinicians with evidence-based protocols and skills
  for screening, brief intervention, and pharmacotherapy for substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Increased knowledge translates to improved self-efficacy and clinical confidence
  in implementing SBI and treatment'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced confidence reduces clinician reluctance to address SUD in primary
  care settings, particularly for complex interventions like opioid use disorder pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Greater clinician confidence creates conditions for more consistent screening
  and early intervention practices'
