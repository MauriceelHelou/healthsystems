description: Rural broadband infrastructure is essential for telehealth access, which can bridge healthcare gaps in areas with limited specialty care. Systematic reviews document that telehealth improves access across multiple dimensions (availability, accessibility, affordability) when adequate infrastructure exists. Infrastructure investment must be paired with provider adoption and digital literacy support to achieve health equity goals.

  equity_implications: Rural areas face underinvestment in telecommunications infrastructure due to lower return on investment. This digital divide compounds existing healthcare workforce shortages in rural areas. Infrastructure investment is necessary but not sufficient - policy must also address device access, affordability, and digital literacy. Tribal communities face additional regulatory barriers to broadband deployment.
assumptions:
- Broadband defined as speeds adequate for video telehealth (minimum 25/3 Mbps)
- Telehealth includes video visits, remote monitoring, and store-and-forward
- Rural defined by Census or OMB classifications
limitations:
- Infrastructure deployment has long lead times and high capital costs
- Some healthcare services require in-person delivery
- Telehealth adoption may face resistance from patients and providers
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Broadband availability varies by population density and terrain
  relevant_geographies:
  - Frontier counties (<7 people/sq mile) face greatest infrastructure gaps
  - Tribal lands face regulatory and investment barriers
  - States with rural broadband programs show faster deployment
