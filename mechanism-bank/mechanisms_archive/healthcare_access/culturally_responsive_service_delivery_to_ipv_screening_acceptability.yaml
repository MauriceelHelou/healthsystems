direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cultural and linguistic concordance in service delivery reduces structural
  communication barriers and builds trust with refugee women navigating unfamiliar
  systems'
- 'Step 2: Language access through interpreters or workers who speak participant''s
  language enables meaningful discussion of sensitive topics like IPV without comprehension
  barriers'
- 'Step 3: Gender concordance (female workers) and demonstrated care addresses cultural
  considerations and safety concerns that may inhibit disclosure in gender-discordant
  or impersonal interactions'
- 'Step 4: Trust in service privacy protects against fears of information sharing
  that could jeopardize immigration status, family relationships, or community standing'
