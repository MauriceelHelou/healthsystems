  node_id: unaddressed_occupational_stress
  node_name: Unaddressed Occupational Stress and Productivity Loss
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workplace stress programs fail to align with needs or preferences of highest-cost
  stressed employee groups (permanent day shift workers, those stressed all the time)'
- 'Step 2: Only 33% of stressed permanent day shift employees and 36% of employees
  stressed all the time express interest in available stress assistance, creating
  access barrier'
- 'Step 3: Low program uptake among high-cost groups means most severe occupational
  stress remains unaddressed by workplace interventions'
- 'Step 4: Untreated chronic workplace stress continues to generate productivity impairment
  and health deterioration without organizational intervention'
