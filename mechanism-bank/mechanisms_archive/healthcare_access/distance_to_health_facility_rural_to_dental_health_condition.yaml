direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater geographic distance to health facilities in rural areas creates
  physical barriers to accessing dental care services'
- 'Step 2: Limited accessibility reduces frequency and regularity of dental treatment
  and preventive care utilization'
- 'Step 3: Reduced dental care utilization leads to untreated dental conditions and
  progressive tooth loss'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative lack of treatment results in worse dental health outcomes, measured
  by having fewer than 20 teeth'
