direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Education of emergency department providers, nurses, and social workers
  on HVIP eligibility requirements increases staff knowledge of which youth violence
  victims qualify for services'
- 'Step 2: Implementation of systematic referral processes (nurses entering consults
  at admission, weekly newsletter updates) creates institutional mechanisms that normalize
  and routinize referrals'
- 'Step 3: Increased staff awareness and standardized processes reduce missed opportunities
  for connecting violence-injured youth to medical, mental health, and social services'
- 'Step 4: Youth sustaining interpersonal violence-related injuries gain access to
  hospital-based intervention programs that can prevent retaliatory violence and address
  underlying trauma'
