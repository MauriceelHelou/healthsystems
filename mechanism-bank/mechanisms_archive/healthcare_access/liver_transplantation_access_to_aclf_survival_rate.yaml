- 'Step 1: Urgent liver transplantation provides functional hepatic capacity to replace
  failed cirrhotic liver'
- 'Step 2: Transplantation interrupts the cascade of organ failures associated with
  ACLF syndrome'
- 'Step 3: Post-transplant survival rates have improved to >83% at 1-year in multiple
  centers'
- 'Step 4: Increased transplant access directly reduces the >75% mortality rate seen
  in untransplanted ACLF-3 patients'
