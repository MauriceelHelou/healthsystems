- 'Step 1: Limited public health education and information dissemination about alcohol
  dependence treatment options'
- 'Step 2: Wives of PwAD do not recognize alcohol dependence as a treatable medical
  condition'
- 'Step 3: Without knowledge of treatment availability, survivors perceive IPV as
  inevitable consequence of unchangeable partner behavior'
- 'Step 4: Lack of awareness prevents survivors from seeking help for themselves or
  encouraging partner treatment'
