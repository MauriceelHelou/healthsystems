direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural barriers including lack of available services, long waitlists,
  transportation difficulties, and service location/hours incompatible with street-involved
  lifestyles prevent healthcare access'
- 'Step 2: These barriers disproportionately affect marginalized populations who lack
  resources to overcome access obstacles (e.g., money for transportation, flexibility
  to attend appointments during business hours)'
- 'Step 3: Unlike motivational barriers which could theoretically be addressed through
  individual intervention, structural barriers require system-level changes in service
  design and resource allocation'
- 'Step 4: Persistence of structural barriers without system reform results in sustained
  high rates of unmet healthcare needs among street-involved people who use drugs'
