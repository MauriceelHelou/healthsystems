mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: VR embodiment as child during domestic violence creates immersive simulation
  of threat environment'
- 'Step 2: Witnessing virtual violence from vulnerable perspective (child''s body)
  activates autonomic nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Men with history of partner aggression show differential physiological
  reactivity patterns compared to controls'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced physiological response to explicit violence but reduced response
  to spatial aggression suggests altered threat detection processing'
