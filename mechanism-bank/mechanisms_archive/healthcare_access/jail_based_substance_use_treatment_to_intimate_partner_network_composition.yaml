mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Jail-based treatment provides education about unhealthy relationship dynamics
  often associated with substance use'
- 'Step 2: Treatment programming creates physical separation from partners who may
  be associated with substance use'
- 'Step 3: Women in treatment may reassess romantic relationships that are not supportive
  of recovery'
- 'Step 4: Treatment participants are less likely to identify partners as primary
  support network members, potentially reflecting distancing from non-recovery-supportive
  relationships'
