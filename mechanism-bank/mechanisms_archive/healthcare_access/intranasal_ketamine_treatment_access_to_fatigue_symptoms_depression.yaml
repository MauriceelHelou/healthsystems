mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intranasal ketamine provides a more accessible route of administration
  compared to intravenous ketamine, reducing cost and access barriers to treatment'
- 'Step 2: A single 50mg dose of intranasal ketamine produces rapid modulation of
  glutamatergic neurotransmission and other neurobiological pathways'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes lead to rapid anti-fatigue effects within
  4-48 hours post-treatment'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in fatigue symptoms occurs in individuals with severe MDD both
  with and without comorbid alcohol use disorder'
