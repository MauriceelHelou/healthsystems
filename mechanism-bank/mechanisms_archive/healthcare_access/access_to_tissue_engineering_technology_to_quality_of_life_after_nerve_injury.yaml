direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tissue engineering techniques represent a promising approach that can overcome
  limitations of conventional surgery and autograft'
- 'Step 2: Access to appropriate cell types, advanced scaffold biomaterials, and specialized
  clinical expertise determines availability of these approaches'
- 'Step 3: Patients with access to tissue engineering approaches experience improved
  nerve regeneration matching autograft potential'
- 'Step 4: Better nerve restoration reduces pain, improves function, and prevents
  the considerable decline in quality of life associated with peripheral neuropathy'
