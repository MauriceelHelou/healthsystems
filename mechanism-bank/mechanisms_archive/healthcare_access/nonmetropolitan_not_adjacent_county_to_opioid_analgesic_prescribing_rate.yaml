direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural counties not adjacent to metropolitan areas have limited healthcare
  infrastructure and fewer specialized pain management services'
- 'Step 2: Geographic isolation increases travel time and costs to access nonopioid
  pain treatment alternatives'
- 'Step 3: Primary care providers in isolated rural areas rely more heavily on opioid
  prescriptions due to limited access to multidisciplinary pain management resources'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers to accessing alternative treatments result in higher
  rates of opioid analgesic prescribing per capita'

  description: Counties adjacent to metropolitan areas have 17% lower opioid prescribing
    rates than non-adjacent counties, suggesting proximity partially mitigates geographic
    isolation effects
