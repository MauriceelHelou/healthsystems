direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Remand prisoners are held in custody awaiting trial, creating a controlled
  environment where health interventions can be systematically delivered'
- 'Step 2: Criminal justice settings provide institutional infrastructure for healthcare
  delivery including dedicated intervention staff (Change Grow Live and Humankind
  organizations)'
- 'Step 3: Structured intervention protocols can be implemented within prison settings,
  enabling access to alcohol brief interventions that may not be accessible in community
  settings'
- 'Step 4: Implementation of ABI within criminal justice settings creates opportunity
  for early intervention with populations experiencing high rates of alcohol-related
  harm'
