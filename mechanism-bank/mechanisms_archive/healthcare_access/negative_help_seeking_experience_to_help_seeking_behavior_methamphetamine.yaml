direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior negative experiences with healthcare system (including stigmatizing
  treatment, ineffective services, or coercive approaches) create trauma and distrust'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare system trauma reflects structural issues including inadequate
  provider training, punitive rather than therapeutic approaches, and system bias
  against people who use drugs'
- 'Step 3: Memory of negative experiences creates anticipatory anxiety and avoidance
  of future help-seeking attempts'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative negative experiences lead to disengagement from formal healthcare
  system and reliance on informal or no support'
