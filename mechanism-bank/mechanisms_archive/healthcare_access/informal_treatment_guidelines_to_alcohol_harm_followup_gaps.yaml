direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hospital emergency departments rely on informal patient care practices
  rather than standardized alcohol screening protocols'
- 'Step 2: Informal practices create inconsistent identification of harmful and hazardous
  alcohol use across patients'
- 'Step 3: Lack of clear follow-up procedures results in missed opportunities for
  early intervention'
- 'Step 4: Patients with harmful alcohol use do not receive systematic follow-up care,
  leading to continued alcohol-related harm'
