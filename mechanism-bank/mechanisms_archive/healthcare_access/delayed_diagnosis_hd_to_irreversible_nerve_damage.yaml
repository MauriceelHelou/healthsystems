mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional palpation examination is subjective and fails to detect nerve
  thickening in earliest cases even when performed by well-trained professionals'
- 'Step 2: Silent (subclinical) peripheral neuropathy progresses undetected in household
  contacts who appear asymptomatic'
- 'Step 3: Without early diagnosis, HD-induced nerve inflammation and damage continues
  unchecked'
- 'Step 4: By time clinical signs are detectable by palpation, irreversible structural
  nerve changes have occurred including focal thickening and asymmetric mononeuropathy'
