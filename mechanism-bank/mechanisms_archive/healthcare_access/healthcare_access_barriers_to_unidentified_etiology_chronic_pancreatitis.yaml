direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited access to comprehensive diagnostic facilities prevents early identification
  of chronic pancreatitis etiology'
- 'Step 2: Delayed or inadequate diagnostic workup results in 35% of patients having
  no identifiable etiology despite extensive investigations'
- 'Step 3: Without identified etiology, targeted interventions to prevent acute exacerbations
  cannot be implemented'
- 'Step 4: This perpetuates cycles of acute-on-chronic disease without addressing
  root causes'
