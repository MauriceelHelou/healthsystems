mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neuropathic pain following detoxification requires management, often with
  prescription analgesics'
- 'Step 2: Individuals recovering from high-risk alcohol use may have heightened vulnerability
  to substance dependence'
- 'Step 3: Chronic pain increases demand for analgesic medications and potential for
  dose escalation'
- 'Step 4: Combined vulnerability from underlying addiction patterns and ongoing pain
  creates risk for developing analgesic addiction'
