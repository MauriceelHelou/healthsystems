direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Major disruptions like pandemics interrupt public health interventions
  including harm reduction programs, overdose prevention services, and community outreach'
- 'Step 2: Interruptions reduce availability of naloxone distribution, syringe services
  programs, and drug checking services'
- 'Step 3: Loss of harm reduction services increases overdose risk among people who
  use drugs without access to life-saving interventions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced community engagement and outreach limit ability to connect people
  who use drugs to treatment and recovery services'
