mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized CIWA-Ar assessment tool provides objective measurement of
  withdrawal severity at regular intervals'
- 'Step 2: Threshold-based medication administration (diazepam 20mg when CIWA-Ar ≥10)
  prevents progression to severe withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: Continuous monitoring in CDU setting enables rapid detection and treatment
  of escalating symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Structured protocol with clear escalation criteria (15% required ≥100mg
  cumulative dose) ensures adequate treatment intensity while maintaining safety'
