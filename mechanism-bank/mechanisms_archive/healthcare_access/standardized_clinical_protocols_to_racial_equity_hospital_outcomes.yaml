mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized protocols for acute pancreatitis management establish uniform
  treatment criteria regardless of patient race'
- 'Step 2: Protocol-driven care reduces opportunity for implicit bias to influence
  clinical decision-making during hospitalization'
- 'Step 3: Equal application of evidence-based interventions leads to similar length
  of stay, ICU admission rates, and mortality across racial groups'
- 'Step 4: Elimination of discretionary variation in inpatient management produces
  equitable treatment outcomes'
