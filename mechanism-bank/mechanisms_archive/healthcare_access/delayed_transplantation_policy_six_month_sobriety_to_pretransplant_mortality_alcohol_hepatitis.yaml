category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy requires 6 months of documented abstinence before patients can be
  placed on transplant waitlist'
- 'Step 2: Patients with severe AH (high MELD and Lille scores) experience progressive
  liver failure during mandatory waiting period'
- 'Step 3: Disease severity exceeds survivability threshold before transplant eligibility
  is achieved'
- 'Step 4: Patients die from complications of acute liver failure before receiving
  transplant'
