mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: QWT''s comprehensive approach increases sustained abstinence compared to
  somatic-only withdrawal treatment'
- 'Step 2: Sustained abstinence reduces exposure to alcohol''s toxic effects on multiple
  organ systems'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases risk of alcohol-related deaths (liver
  disease, cardiovascular disease, injuries, etc.)'
- 'Step 4: Population-level mortality rates decrease among those with severe AUD'
