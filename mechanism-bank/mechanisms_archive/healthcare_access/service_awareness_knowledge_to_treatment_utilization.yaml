mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited outreach and communication from traditional drug and alcohol services
  to British South Asian and Muslim communities'
- 'Step 2: Community members lack knowledge about available treatment options, service
  locations, and how to access support'
- 'Step 3: Information barriers compounded by language differences and culturally
  inappropriate communication strategies'
- 'Step 4: Low awareness results in minimal treatment service utilization even among
  those who recognize need for help'
