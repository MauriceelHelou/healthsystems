- name: need_for_subsequent_surgery
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Patients who needed later surgery (23%) had significantly more pain
    (p=0.043) and fatigue (p=0.021), indicating endoscopic procedures were less effective
    for this subgroup
- name: time_since_diagnosis
  direction: u_shaped
  strength: moderate
  description: Median time to endoscopic procedure was one year (range 0-39 years),
    suggesting timing of intervention may moderate effectiveness
