- 'Step 1: Healthcare providers implement systematic alcohol screening in primary
  care and reproductive health settings to identify women of childbearing age who
  use alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Providers deliver evidence-based brief interventions to reduce excessive
  alcohol use among women at risk for pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Brief interventions provide counseling, risk information, and support for
  behavior change regarding alcohol use and contraception'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol consumption among women of childbearing age decreases the
  incidence of pregnancies where fetal alcohol exposure occurs'
