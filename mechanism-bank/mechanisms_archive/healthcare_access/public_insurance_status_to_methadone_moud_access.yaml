direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public insurance coverage (e.g., Medicaid) provides funding mechanisms
  for methadone treatment programs'
- 'Step 2: Methadone can only be dispensed through federally regulated opioid treatment
  programs, which require infrastructure and operational funding'
- 'Step 3: Publicly insured pregnant people are channeled toward methadone programs
  due to reimbursement structures and availability of federally-supported treatment
  sites'
- 'Step 4: More than 90% of pregnancies with methadone MOUD were among publicly insured
  people, indicating structural insurance-treatment linkage'
