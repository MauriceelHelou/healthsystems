mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal care provides clinical contact points where opioid use disorder
  can be identified and addressed'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers in prenatal settings can facilitate referrals to MOUD
  programs or initiate treatment directly'
- 'Step 3: In most pregnancies studied, prenatal care and MOUD were first documented
  in the same trimester, indicating temporal co-occurrence'
- 'Step 4: The bidirectional relationship suggests prenatal care serves as gateway
  to MOUD access and vice versa'
