- 'Step 1: Telehealth infrastructure provides alternative delivery mechanism for mental
  health services to geographically isolated youth'
- 'Step 2: Digital service delivery reduces need for physical travel and associated
  costs/time burdens'
- 'Step 3: Increased service access options particularly beneficial in situations
  of large travel distances'
- 'Step 4: Youth utilize telehealth as adjunct to face-to-face services, filling gaps
  when in-person attendance is not feasible'
