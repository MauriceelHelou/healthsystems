description: Lack of health insurance prevents access to preventive asthma care, leading to uncontrolled
  symptoms and increased exacerbations.

  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects policy failures in healthcare system design - the US lacks
    universal healthcare coverage unlike other developed nations. Insurance gaps result from employer-based
    coverage systems, Medicaid eligibility restrictions, and policy choices, not individual responsibility.
    Uninsurance rates are highest among communities of color due to employment discrimination and exclusion
    from job-based benefits.
