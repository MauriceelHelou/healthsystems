direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended withdrawal programs with psychosocial components increase treatment
  completion and long-term abstinence'
- 'Step 2: Higher abstinence rates reduce population-level alcohol consumption among
  those with severe AUD'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases incidence of alcohol-attributable
  diseases (liver disease, cancers, cardiovascular disease, injuries)'
- 'Step 4: Overall population burden of alcohol-attributable disease decreases'
