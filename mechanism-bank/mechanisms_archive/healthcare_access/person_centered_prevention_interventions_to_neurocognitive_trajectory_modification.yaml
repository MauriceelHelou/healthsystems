mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Person-centered prevention interventions are designed to target specific
  neurocognitive domains identified in the RDoC framework'
- 'Step 2: Interventions engage neurobiological mechanisms across negative valence,
  positive valence, cognitive, social, and arousal/regulatory systems'
- 'Step 3: By targeting these specific neural systems during critical developmental
  periods, interventions can modify aberrant neurocognitive trajectories'
- 'Step 4: Modified neurocognitive trajectories reduce risk factors that predispose
  adolescents to substance use disorder development'
