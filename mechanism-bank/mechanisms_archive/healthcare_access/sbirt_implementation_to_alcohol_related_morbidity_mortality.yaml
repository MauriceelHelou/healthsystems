- 'Step 1: Systematic screening in primary care identifies patients with unhealthy
  alcohol use who would otherwise go undetected'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention provides evidence-based counseling at point of care,
  increasing motivation and awareness'
- 'Step 3: Referral to treatment connects patients with specialty services for alcohol
  use disorder when needed'
- 'Step 4: Early identification and intervention reduces progression to severe alcohol
  use disorder and associated health complications'
