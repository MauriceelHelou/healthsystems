direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transplant centers establish 6-month pretransplant abstinence requirements
  as gatekeeping criteria for liver transplant eligibility'
- 'Step 2: Patients with severe alcohol-associated liver disease who cannot achieve
  or sustain 6 months of abstinence are excluded from transplant consideration'
- 'Step 3: Centers are removing these requirements to provide early liver transplant
  (ELT), with all responding centers now evaluating patients for ELT despite abstinence
  duration'
- 'Step 4: Expanded access through removal of arbitrary time-based abstinence requirements
  allows patients with <6 months survival prognosis to receive transplants'
