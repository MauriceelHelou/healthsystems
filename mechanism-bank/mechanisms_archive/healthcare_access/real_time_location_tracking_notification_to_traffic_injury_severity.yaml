- 'Step 1: System detects drunk driving attempt and automatically transmits text message
  with GPS coordinates and Google Maps integration'
- 'Step 2: Real-time location data enables faster emergency response and monitoring
  by authorities or designated contacts'
- 'Step 3: Reduced response time to impaired driving incidents allows for earlier
  intervention before crashes occur'
- 'Step 4: Earlier intervention and emergency response reduces severity of injuries
  when incidents do occur'
