direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: No authorized pharmacological treatments exist for severe alcohol-associated
  hepatitis beyond corticosteroids'
- 'Step 2: Limited therapeutic options mean clinicians can only offer supportive care
  and transplantation'
- 'Step 3: Patients who fail corticosteroid therapy or are not transplant candidates
  have no effective alternatives'
- 'Step 4: High short-term mortality persists due to therapeutic gap in severe disease
  management'
