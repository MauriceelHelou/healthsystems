direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integration of HCV services (screening, referral, treatment, harm reduction)
  within addiction treatment centers reduces structural barriers to access'
- 'Step 2: Co-location of services eliminates need for separate appointments and navigation
  of multiple healthcare systems'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive service delivery at a single site increases likelihood that
  PWID will complete the full care cascade'
- 'Step 4: When all four services are available and delivered to >50% of patients,
  treatment engagement increases among this marginalized population'
