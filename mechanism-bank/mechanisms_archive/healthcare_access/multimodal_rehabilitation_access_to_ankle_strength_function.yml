mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structured rehabilitation programs provide supervised ankle strengthening and stretching exercises'
- 'Step 2: Joint mobilizations and balance training address biomechanical impairments'
- 'Step 3: Progressive loading and neuromuscular training restore ankle stability'
- 'Step 4: Improved ankle strength and range of motion reduce chronic instability symptoms'

  equity_implications: Access to comprehensive rehabilitation services depends on healthcare coverage,
    geographic proximity to specialized facilities, and ability to attend frequent sessions - factors
    that may create disparities in recovery outcomes for individuals with chronic ankle instability
