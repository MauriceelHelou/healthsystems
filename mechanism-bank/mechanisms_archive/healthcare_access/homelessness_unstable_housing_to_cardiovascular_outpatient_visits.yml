- 'Step 1: Homelessness and unstable housing creates barriers to maintaining regular healthcare appointments
  and follow-up care'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable address and communication methods impedes healthcare system navigation and appointment
  scheduling'
- 'Step 3: Transportation barriers and competing survival needs reduce ability to access routine cardiovascular
  care'
- 'Step 4: Reduced outpatient cardiovascular disease management visits result in suboptimal chronic disease
  control'

  description: Veterans are disproportionately affected by homelessness, creating amplified barriers to
    care access
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects how housing instability - often rooted in inadequate affordable
    housing policies, insufficient veteran support systems, and economic inequality - creates systematic
    barriers to healthcare access. The effect demonstrates how structural determinants produce health
    inequities through healthcare access pathways rather than individual choices.
