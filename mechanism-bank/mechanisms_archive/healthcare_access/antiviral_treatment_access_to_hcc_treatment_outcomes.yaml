mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Viral etiology (predominantly hepatitis B and C) drives hepatocellular
  carcinoma development in the study populations'
- 'Step 2: Adjuvant antiviral treatment can reduce viral load and hepatic inflammation,
  potentially improving liver function and reducing recurrence risk'
- 'Step 3: Absence of reporting on antiviral treatment access suggests unmeasured
  structural variation in comprehensive HCC care'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system integration determines whether patients receive both
  cancer treatment and underlying viral disease management'
