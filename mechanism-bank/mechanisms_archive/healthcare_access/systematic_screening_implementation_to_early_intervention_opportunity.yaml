direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care pediatric practices serve as universal access point where
  most adolescents receive preventive health services'
- 'Step 2: Systematic implementation of validated screening tools creates standardized
  process for detecting substance use across all patients regardless of presenting
  complaint'
- 'Step 3: Universal screening reduces reliance on provider clinical judgment alone,
  which may be biased or miss non-obvious cases'
- 'Step 4: Detected cases trigger brief intervention protocols and care pathways that
  would not occur without systematic screening'
