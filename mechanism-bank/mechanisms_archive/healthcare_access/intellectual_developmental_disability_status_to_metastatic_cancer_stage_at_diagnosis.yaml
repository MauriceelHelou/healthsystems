direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: People with IDD experience lower cancer screening rates due to systemic
  barriers in healthcare access and accommodation'
- 'Step 2: Reduced screening leads to missed opportunities for early cancer detection
  during asymptomatic stages'
- 'Step 3: Cancers progress undetected to advanced metastatic stages before clinical
  presentation'
- 'Step 4: Diagnostic delays result in higher proportion of Stage IV cancer at initial
  diagnosis'
