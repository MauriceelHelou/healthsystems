mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HRUS provides objective, validated technique with good reproducibility
  to evaluate peripheral nerves with detailed accuracy'
- 'Step 2: HRUS detects nerve thickening and asymmetry in household contacts that
  would be missed by subjective palpation examination'
- 'Step 3: Assessment of 14 nerve points reveals asymmetric multiple mononeuropathy
  patterns (≥20% of nerves affected) characteristic of HD neuropathy'
- 'Step 4: Earlier detection of silent neuropathy enables treatment initiation before
  clinical symptoms develop and irreversible damage occurs'
