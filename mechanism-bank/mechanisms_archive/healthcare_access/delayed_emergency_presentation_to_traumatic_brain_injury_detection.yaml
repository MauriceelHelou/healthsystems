direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Delays in emergency department presentation after minor head trauma reduce
  the immediate visibility of acute symptoms that clinical decision rules rely upon'
- 'Step 2: PECARN and CATCH clinical decision rules were validated primarily on populations
  presenting within 24 hours, when symptoms are most acute'
- 'Step 3: In children presenting after 24 hours, sensitivity of both PECARN and CATCH
  rules decreased from 96.3%/91.9% to 85.7%, potentially missing traumatic intracranial
  injuries'
- 'Step 4: Reduced sensitivity leads to potential underdetection of traumatic CT findings
  requiring intervention'
