mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographic distance to specialized hepatology services limits access'
- 'Step 2: Transportation barriers prevent regular follow-up appointments'
- 'Step 3: Complex care coordination requirements overwhelm patients'
- 'Step 4: Disrupted treatment continuity reduces effectiveness of interventions'
- 'Step 5: Poor continuity leads to treatment failure and disease progression'

description: Logistical challenges in accessing and coordinating ALD care, including geographic barriers
  and care complexity, disrupt treatment continuity and reduce intervention effectiveness.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Rural areas likely experience greater logistical barriers due to specialist scarcity
    and geographic distances

  description: Integrated care models can reduce logistical barriers by coordinating services and reducing
    care fragmentation
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Logistical barriers reflect healthcare system organization and resource distribution
    rather than patient compliance issues. Geographic maldistribution of specialists creates systematic
    disadvantages for rural and underserved populations. This mechanism demonstrates how healthcare delivery
    models can either facilitate or impede equitable access to care.
