mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinical trials systematically exclude people most affected by TB pandemic
  (62.5% exclude youth, 85% exclude pregnant/lactating people, 30% exclude people
  with diabetes, 27.5% exclude people with alcohol/drug use)'
- 'Step 2: Trial participants become unrepresentative of global TB population, with
  only 33% female participants despite gender parity in TB burden'
- 'Step 3: Adverse event profiles and treatment efficacy data do not reflect responses
  in excluded populations'
- 'Step 4: Treatment guidelines based on non-representative samples have reduced applicability
  to real-world TB populations'
- 'Step 5: Health equity gaps widen as treatment recommendations lack evidence base
  for most-affected populations'

    of trials) have particularly strong effects on reducing representativeness
