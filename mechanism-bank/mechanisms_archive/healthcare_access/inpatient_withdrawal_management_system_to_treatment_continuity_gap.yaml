direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare system structurally separates acute inpatient withdrawal management
  from ongoing outpatient addiction treatment, creating administrative and logistical
  discontinuity'
- 'Step 2: Patients are discharged from medically supervised inpatient settings to
  community environments without automatic linkage mechanisms or transitional support'
- 'Step 3: Lack of care coordination infrastructure means patients must independently
  navigate complex outpatient referral systems while managing withdrawal symptoms
  and social stressors'
- 'Step 4: Most patients fail to successfully link to ongoing treatment, leading to
  relapse and repeated cycles of crisis-driven inpatient admissions'

  description: Comprehensive insurance coverage may reduce some barriers to treatment
    linkage but does not address systemic care coordination failures

  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Patients with strong social support networks may have better outcomes
    navigating fragmented systems, but this places burden on informal caregivers rather
    than addressing structural failure
