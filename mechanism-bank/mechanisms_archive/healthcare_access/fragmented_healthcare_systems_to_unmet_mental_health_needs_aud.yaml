direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems typically separate mental health, substance use, and
  chronic disease care into distinct service silos'
- 'Step 2: People with AUD who develop Type 2 diabetes must navigate multiple disconnected
  care pathways'
- 'Step 3: Lack of care coordination and holistic assessment means comorbid mental
  health conditions are under-detected and under-treated'
- 'Step 4: Unmet mental health needs accumulate, leading to incident depression and
  anxiety episodes following diabetes diagnosis'
