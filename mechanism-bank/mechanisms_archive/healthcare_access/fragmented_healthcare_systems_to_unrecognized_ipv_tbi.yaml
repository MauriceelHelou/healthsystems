direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems operate in silos without coordination between IPV services
  and TBI screening protocols'
- 'Step 2: Lack of cross-disciplinary knowledge sharing prevents practitioners from
  recognizing IPV as a TBI risk factor'
- 'Step 3: Absence of integrated screening tools and care pathways means TBI symptoms
  in IPV survivors go undetected'
- 'Step 4: Women survivors do not receive appropriate TBI diagnosis, treatment, or
  rehabilitation services'
