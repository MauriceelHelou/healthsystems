mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare documentation systems may not capture all clinical interactions,
  particularly informal or undocumented conversations about substance use'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents perceive being asked about alcohol or drug use at higher rates
  (80.7%-81%) than documented in EHR (16.3%-65.7%)'
- 'Step 3: Documentation gaps underestimate actual service delivery and create inaccurate
  picture of screening implementation'

  description: The gap between adolescent-reported screening and EHR documentation
    narrowed from pre-implementation (80.7% vs 16.3%, gap of 64.4 percentage points)

    perceptions remained consistently high
