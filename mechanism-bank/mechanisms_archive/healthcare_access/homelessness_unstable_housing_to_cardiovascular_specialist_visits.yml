mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates additional barriers to accessing specialized cardiovascular care
  requiring referrals and coordination'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing disrupts continuity of care relationships necessary for specialist referrals'
- 'Step 3: Administrative barriers increase when patients lack stable addresses for appointment scheduling
  and communication'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to cardiovascular specialists limits specialized interventions and disease management'

  description: Veterans with preexisting cardiovascular disease have greater need for specialist care,
    making access barriers more impactful
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism demonstrates how housing policy failures and inadequate social safety
    nets create cascading effects on healthcare access. The larger effect size for specialist visits compared
    to general outpatient visits reflects how housing instability disproportionately affects access to
    more complex, coordinated care services.
