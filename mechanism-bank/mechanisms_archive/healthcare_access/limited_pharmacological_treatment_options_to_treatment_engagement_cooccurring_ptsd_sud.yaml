direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current treatment recommendations for co-occurring PTSD and SUD are limited
  to psychosocial therapies only'
- 'Step 2: Lack of pharmacological alternatives reduces treatment options for individuals
  who cannot access or engage with psychosocial therapies'
- 'Step 3: Reduced treatment diversity limits ability to match interventions to individual
  needs, preferences, and circumstances'
- 'Step 4: Limited options result in lower treatment engagement and reduced recovery
  outcomes'
