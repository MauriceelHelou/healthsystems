direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Settlement services serve as a key access point where refugee women with
  diverse needs regularly interface with support systems'
- 'Step 2: Systematic IPV screening using validated tools (ACTS) creates structured
  opportunities for disclosure in contexts women already access'
- 'Step 3: High acceptability of screening (93% comfortable, 84% agreement) reduces
  barriers to identification of IPV among refugee women experiencing post-migration
  challenges'
- 'Step 4: Brief intervention and referral pathways embedded in settlement services
  enable connection to specialized support systems for women experiencing IPV'
