direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Occupational health services lack adequate training, time allocation, and
  resources for alcohol prevention programs'
- 'Step 2: OHS professionals are unable to implement primary, secondary, and tertiary
  alcohol prevention activities due to organizational constraints'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol prevention activity leads to fewer interventions for employees
  who may benefit (1-3 out of 10 employees)'
- 'Step 4: Employees miss opportunities for early intervention and continue alcohol
  use patterns that lead to detrimental health and work performance outcomes'
