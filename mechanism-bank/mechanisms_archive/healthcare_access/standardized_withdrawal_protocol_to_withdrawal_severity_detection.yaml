direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of standardized assessment protocols (Yale Alcohol Withdrawal
  Protocol) creates systematic measurement of withdrawal symptoms at defined time
  intervals'
- 'Step 2: Validated scoring tools enable objective quantification of withdrawal severity
  across multiple clinical domains (tremor, agitation, orientation)'
- 'Step 3: Regular systematic assessment captures progression or resolution of withdrawal
  syndrome, enabling timely treatment adjustments'
- 'Step 4: Standardization reduces variability in clinical recognition and response
  to withdrawal severity across different providers and shifts'
