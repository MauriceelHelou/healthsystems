category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Continuation of methadone during incarceration maintains opioid tolerance
  regulation and prevents physiological destabilization'
- 'Step 2: Maintained treatment prevents withdrawal-related medication discontinuation
  that increases vulnerability to overdose'
- 'Step 3: Sustained therapeutic medication levels reduce craving and unsupervised
  opioid use upon release'
- 'Step 4: Lower likelihood of relapse to illicit opioid use reduces exposure to substances
  of unknown potency that cause overdose'
