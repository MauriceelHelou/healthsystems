mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Universal SBIRT protocols include screening for illicit drug use and non-medical
  prescription drug use across all primary care patients'
- 'Step 2: Systematic drug use screening detects substance use problems that carry
  significant stigma and are less likely to be spontaneously disclosed in medical
  settings'
- 'Step 3: Standardized assessment tools provide clinical legitimacy for discussing
  and documenting drug use concerns'
- 'Step 4: Provider recognition and documentation of drug use patterns leads to formal
  DSM-IV drug abuse or dependence diagnosis on Medicaid claims'
