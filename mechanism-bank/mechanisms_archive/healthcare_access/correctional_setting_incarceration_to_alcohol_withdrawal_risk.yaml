  node_name: Risk of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with chronic alcohol use are abruptly separated from alcohol
  access upon incarceration, forcing immediate cessation without voluntary tapering'
- 'Step 2: Newly incarcerated inmates enter a controlled environment where alcohol
  is unavailable, triggering physiological withdrawal responses within hours to days'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate medical infrastructure, inmates experience unchecked withdrawal
  symptoms ranging from mild (tremors, anxiety) to severe (seizures, delirium tremens)'
- 'Step 4: High-volume intake (average 97 admissions per week to ADU) in large jail
  systems (18,000 inmates) concentrates withdrawal risk in populations with limited
  healthcare access pre-incarceration'
