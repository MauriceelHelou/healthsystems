mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standard mhGAP requires 4-6 in-person sessions creating cumulative attendance
  burden'
- 'Step 2: Each session requires time off work, childcare arrangements, transportation,
  and associated costs'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers accumulate across multiple required visits, increasing
  dropout risk'
- 'Step 4: Lower treatment completion rates result in reduced effectiveness of alcohol
  use interventions'
