direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Both CIWA-Ar and mMINDS scoring tools assess overlapping clinical manifestations
  of alcohol withdrawal syndrome including tremor, agitation, and orientation status'
- 'Step 2: Higher severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms manifests consistently across
  both assessment instruments'
- 'Step 3: Correlation is particularly robust in mild-to-moderate withdrawal (CIWA-Ar
  ≤10) where symptoms are more reliably assessed across both tools'
- 'Step 4: Standardized assessment protocols enable consistent identification of withdrawal
  severity regardless of which validated tool is used'
