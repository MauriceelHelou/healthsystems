mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Practice facilitators work with clinics to co-identify implementation goals
  based on clinic-specific needs and contexts'
- 'Step 2: Facilitators provide technical support for data tracking systems and social
  support through staff training'
- 'Step 3: Tailored approach allows clinics to address both infrastructure barriers
  (e.g., reporting systems) and workforce barriers (e.g., knowledge gaps)'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced organizational capacity enables systematic screening and brief
  intervention for unhealthy alcohol use'

  description: Paper notes that involvement of experienced facilitators is recommended,
    and flexibility sometimes led to confusion, suggesting facilitator expertise moderates
    implementation success

  description: Tailored approach based on clinic needs implies that clinics with different
    baseline capacities may achieve different levels of implementation
