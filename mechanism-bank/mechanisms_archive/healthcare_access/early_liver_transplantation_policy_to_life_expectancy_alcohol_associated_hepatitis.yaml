direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early transplantation policy eliminates 6-month mandatory sobriety waiting
  period before waitlist placement'
- 'Step 2: Patients with severe AH (high MELD and Lille scores) receive liver transplant
  before disease progression leads to death'
- 'Step 3: Transplantation replaces failing liver, preventing mortality from acute
  liver failure'
- 'Step 4: Survival extends across all post-transplant alcohol use scenarios including
  abstinence, slip, and sustained use'
