direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary healthcare systems implement systematic alcohol screening protocols
  at specified coverage rates'
- 'Step 2: Screening identifies patients with risky drinking patterns who would otherwise
  remain undetected'
- 'Step 3: Positive screens trigger clinical pathways for brief intervention or referral
  to treatment'
- 'Step 4: Higher screening coverage directly increases the absolute number and proportion
  of population receiving evidence-based interventions'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Starting from very low baseline (2.9%), increasing to 50% screening
    coverage resulted in intervention receipt rising from 2.4% to 21% of adult population
    over 10 years
- name: time_period
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Ten-year simulation period allows cumulative reach to population, as
    individuals may be screened multiple times across PHC encounters
