mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Access to and use of antihypertensive medications (thiazide diuretics,
  ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers) lowers blood pressure to target
  levels (<130/80 mmHg)'
- 'Step 2: Lowered blood pressure reduces mechanical stress on arterial walls and
  decreases atherosclerotic progression'
- 'Step 3: Reduced blood pressure decreases risk of target organ damage including
  stroke, coronary atherosclerosis, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of target organ damage results in reduced cardiovascular disease
  occurrence, disability, and death'
