direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency shelters integrate harm reduction services (e.g., substance use
  support) rather than requiring abstinence'
- 'Step 2: Removal of abstinence barriers reduces exclusion of PWUD from shelter services'
- 'Step 3: PWUD who typically refuse traditional shelters are able to access safe
  housing during COVID-19'
- 'Step 4: Continuity of care is maintained while individuals are sheltered'
