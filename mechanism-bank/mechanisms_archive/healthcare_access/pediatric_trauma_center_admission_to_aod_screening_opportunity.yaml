direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traumatic injury requiring hospital admission creates a mandatory healthcare
  system contact point for adolescents who may otherwise lack regular healthcare access'
- 'Step 2: Trauma admission represents a ''teachable moment'' when adolescents and
  families may be receptive to health interventions'
- 'Step 3: Inpatient setting provides structural opportunity for systematic screening
  implementation through admission protocols and EHR integration'
- 'Step 4: Trauma center accreditation requirements from American College of Surgeons
  create institutional mandate for AOD screening and intervention'
