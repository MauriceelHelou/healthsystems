mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized protocol connects patients with substance abuse treatment
  programs during the detoxification process'
- 'Step 2: E-consult assesses patient interest in ongoing treatment and facilitates
  appropriate follow-up care linkages'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive medication management (including gabapentin) may reduce withdrawal
  severity and relapse risk'
- 'Step 4: Coordinated care pathway reduces likelihood of repeat emergency presentations
  and readmissions for alcohol withdrawal'
