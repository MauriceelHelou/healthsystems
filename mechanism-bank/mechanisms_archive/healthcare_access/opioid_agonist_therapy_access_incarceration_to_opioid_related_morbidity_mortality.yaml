mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice system recognizes high prevalence of OUD among incarcerated
  population and implements evidence-based treatment provision'
- 'Step 2: Opioid agonist therapy during incarceration maintains treatment continuity
  and prevents forced withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: Maintained therapy prevents tolerance reduction that increases overdose
  risk upon release'
- 'Step 4: Treatment engagement during incarceration facilitates connections to continued
  care post-release'
- 'Step 5: Reduced treatment gaps and maintained tolerance decrease morbidity and
  mortality risk'
