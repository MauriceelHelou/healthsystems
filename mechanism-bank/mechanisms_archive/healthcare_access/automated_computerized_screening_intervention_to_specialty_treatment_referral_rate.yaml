mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Computerized system systematically assesses need for specialty treatment
  based on standardized criteria'
- 'Step 2: Automated referral process bypasses barriers of clinician time constraints
  and competing priorities during brief primary care visits'
- 'Step 3: System provides consistent, protocolized referral to specialty care for
  patients meeting clinical thresholds'
- 'Step 4: Increased referral rates connect more patients with severe alcohol use
  to appropriate level of care'
