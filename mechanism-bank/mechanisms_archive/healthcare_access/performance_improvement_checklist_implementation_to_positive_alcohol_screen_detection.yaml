direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased screening coverage reaches previously unscreened populations
  with higher alcohol use prevalence'
- 'Step 2: Standardized screening criteria (BAC >80 mg/dL, age <21, AUDIT ≥8) applied
  consistently to all patients'
- 'Step 3: Broader screening net captures patients who previously avoided detection
  due to selective screening practices'
- 'Step 4: Higher detection rates enable more opportunities for early intervention
  and treatment referral'
