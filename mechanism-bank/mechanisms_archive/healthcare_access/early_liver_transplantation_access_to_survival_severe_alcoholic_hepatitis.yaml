mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Selected patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis who do not respond
  to steroid therapy are evaluated for early transplantation'
- 'Step 2: Early liver transplantation provides definitive treatment by replacing
  diseased liver before progression to multi-organ failure'
- 'Step 3: Post-transplant immunosuppression and new functioning liver halt the inflammatory
  cascade and hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 4: Patients who receive early transplantation achieve significantly higher
  survival rates compared to non-transplanted patients'
