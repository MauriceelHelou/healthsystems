mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Harm reduction treatment provides non-abstinence-based care that removes
  barriers to treatment engagement for people experiencing homelessness with AUD'
- 'Step 2: Patient-driven goal-setting allows individuals to identify personally relevant
  goals (quality of life, basic needs, physical/mental health) rather than mandating
  abstinence'
- 'Step 3: Increased treatment engagement and goal achievement leads to reduced alcohol-related
  harm and improved quality of life outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Sustained participation in patient-centered care creates opportunities
  for addressing multiple co-occurring health and social needs'
