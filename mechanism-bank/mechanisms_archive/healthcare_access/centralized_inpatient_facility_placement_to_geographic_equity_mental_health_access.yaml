direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inpatient mental health services can be centrally located without creating
  significant distance decay effects for most psychiatric conditions'
- 'Step 2: The acute nature of inpatient admissions and legal obligations for care
  provision override typical geographic barriers'
- 'Step 3: Centralized placement allows resource concentration and efficiency without
  substantially impacting utilization patterns for most disorders'
- 'Step 4: Geographic equity in inpatient access is maintained despite centralization,
  except for specific conditions like organic mental disorders'
