    Outcomes
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Principles and frameworks for cultural responsiveness address systemic
  barriers that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face in accessing and
  experiencing healthcare'
- 'Step 2: Operationalization of these principles through structured implementation
  processes enables mainstream services to identify and address institutional practices
  that perpetuate inequitable care'
- 'Step 3: Improved cultural safety and responsiveness reduces experiences of discrimination,
  increases trust, and makes services more accessible and acceptable to Indigenous
  communities'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced access to and quality of AoD treatment services leads to improved
  treatment engagement, retention, and ultimately better health outcomes for Aboriginal
  and Torres Strait Islander people'
