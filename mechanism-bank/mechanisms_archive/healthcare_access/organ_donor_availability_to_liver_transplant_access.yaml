direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited organ donor availability creates scarcity in the transplant system'
- 'Step 2: Scarcity necessitates strict patient selection criteria for transplant
  eligibility'
- 'Step 3: Only 0-10% of ACLF-2 and ACLF-3 patients receive transplantation despite
  being the main effective treatment'
- 'Step 4: Reduced transplant access increases mortality among eligible ACLF patients'
