direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple structural barriers (regulatory restrictions, stigma, limited
  provider capacity, geographic maldistribution) reduce MAT availability'
- 'Step 2: Barriers disproportionately affect rural communities, low-income populations,
  and areas with limited healthcare infrastructure'
- 'Step 3: Reduced MAT availability limits access to comprehensive, evidence-based
  OUD treatment'
- 'Step 4: Treatment access disparities contribute to inequitable opioid-related health
  outcomes across populations'
