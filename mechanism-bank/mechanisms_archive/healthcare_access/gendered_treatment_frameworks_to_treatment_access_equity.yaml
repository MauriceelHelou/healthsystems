mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinical trials and treatment practices narrowly conceptualize violence
  as intimate partner or domestic violence, primarily affecting cisgender women'
- 'Step 2: This gendered framework excludes recognition of violence experienced by
  men, transgender individuals, non-binary people, and those in same-sex relationships'
- 'Step 3: Treatment programs fail to screen for or address diverse forms of violence
  (community violence, political violence, structural violence) affecting marginalized
  groups'
- 'Step 4: Marginalized populations do not see their experiences reflected in treatment
  frameworks and face barriers to engagement'
- 'Step 5: Inequitable access to appropriate, affirming substance use disorder treatment
  persists for non-dominant gender identities and sexual minorities'
