mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fewer prior treatments may signal to providers that patient has not exhausted
  lower-intensity options'
- 'Step 2: Treatment system norms may emphasize stepped care approaches starting with
  least intensive services'
- 'Step 3: Patients with limited treatment history may be preferentially placed in
  higher intensity care to prevent progression'
- 'Step 4: This results in placement at intensity levels higher than standardized
  assessment indicates as necessary'
