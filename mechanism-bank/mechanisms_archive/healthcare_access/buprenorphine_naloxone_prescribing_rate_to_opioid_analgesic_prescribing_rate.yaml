direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher buprenorphine/naloxone prescribing indicates greater availability
  of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) infrastructure and providers'
- 'Step 2: Areas with MAT capacity have more providers trained in evidence-based pain
  and addiction management approaches'
- 'Step 3: Provider education and alternative treatment availability reduce reliance
  on opioid analgesics for pain management'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare system investment in MAT infrastructure creates spillover effects
  reducing overall opioid prescribing'
