mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act grants DEA waiver authority
  to NPs and PAs to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder'
- 'Step 2: NPs and PAs are more geographically distributed in rural areas than waivered
  physicians'
- 'Step 3: Expanded prescriber pool increases the number of available treatment slots
  in rural communities'
- 'Step 4: Increased treatment slot availability reduces geographic barriers to accessing
  medication-assisted treatment for rural patients with opioid use disorder'
