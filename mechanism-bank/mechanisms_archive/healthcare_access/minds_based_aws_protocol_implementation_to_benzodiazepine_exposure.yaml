mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of standardized MINDS-based protocol (SDAWP) provides systematic
  symptom assessment framework for alcohol withdrawal syndrome'
- 'Step 2: Symptom-triggered therapy approach using revised MINDS index enables more
  precise titration of benzodiazepine administration based on objective withdrawal
  severity'
- 'Step 3: Standardized assessment reduces unnecessary or excessive benzodiazepine
  dosing while maintaining therapeutic efficacy'
- 'Step 4: Lower cumulative benzodiazepine exposure achieved while maintaining patient
  safety'
