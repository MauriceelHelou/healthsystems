mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater travel time by public transportation creates temporal and logistical
  barriers to accessing outpatient mental health services'
- 'Step 2: Distance decay effect reduces the gravitational pull of mental health facilities
  for geographically remote populations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced utilization occurs across all mental disorder types, even after
  controlling for community socioeconomic characteristics'
- 'Step 4: Remote areas become insufficiently supplied with mental health care, creating
  geographic inequities in access'
