direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized protocol implementation improves withdrawal symptom management
  on general medical ward'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced early detection and treatment of escalating withdrawal reduces
  progression to severe complications requiring ICU-level care'
- 'Step 3: Consistent application of evidence-based benzodiazepine dosing maintains
  adequate symptom control within medical ward capacity'
- 'Step 4: Reduced need for transfer to intensive care settings due to improved management
  at initial level of care'
