mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Finasteride inhibits 5-alpha reductase enzyme, decreasing dihydrotestosterone
  (DHT) and altering neurosteroid production'
- 'Step 2: Reduced neurosteroid levels (including allopregnanolone) affect mood-regulating
  neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 3: Disruption of serotonergic and GABAergic systems impairs mood regulation
  and stress response'
- 'Step 4: Sustained neurochemical changes increase vulnerability to depressive symptoms
  and clinical depression'
