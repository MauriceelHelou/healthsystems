direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transplant programs apply selection criteria including age, addiction-related
  factors, and nutritional status'
- 'Step 2: These criteria disproportionately exclude patients with social disadvantage
  (e.g., addiction issues often rooted in social determinants, severe malnutrition
  reflecting food insecurity)'
- 'Step 3: Exclusion based on ''addictology criteria'' may systematically disadvantage
  patients with substance use disorders, which are themselves shaped by structural
  factors'
- 'Step 4: Reduced eligibility among socially disadvantaged populations creates inequitable
  access to the main effective treatment'
