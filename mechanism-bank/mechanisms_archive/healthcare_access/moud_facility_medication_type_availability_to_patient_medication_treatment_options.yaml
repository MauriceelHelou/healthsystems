mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different MOUD medications (methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) have
  distinct clinical profiles, administration requirements, and patient suitability'
- 'Step 2: Facility-level availability of specific medication types determines which
  treatment options are accessible to patients in that geographic area'
- 'Step 3: Among critical access facilities, only 3 provide methadone, 77 provide
  buprenorphine, and 23 provide naltrexone, creating differential medication access
  patterns'
- 'Step 4: Limited medication type availability constrains patient-provider shared
  decision-making and optimal treatment matching'
