direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Minimal evidence exists to guide inpatient management decisions for severe
  alcohol withdrawal syndrome'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians lack standardized, evidence-based protocols for treating critically
  ill patients with SAWS'
- 'Step 3: Suboptimal treatment approaches lead to preventable complications and prolonged
  critical illness'
- 'Step 4: Increased morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients experiencing
  SAWS'
