mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ICE provides real-time visualization of cardiac structures reducing reliance
  on fluoroscopic imaging'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced catheter navigation capability decreases need for repeated imaging
  attempts'
- 'Step 3: Reduced fluoroscopy time and contrast agent use directly lowers cumulative
  radiation dose to patient'

  description: ICE used more often in patients with atrial tachycardia (OR 3.692),
    higher HAS-BLED scores (OR 1.541), and heart failure (OR 2.098), suggesting greater
    benefit in complex cases
