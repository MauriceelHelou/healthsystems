direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Protocol pairs objective withdrawal severity assessment (modified Minnesota
  Detoxification Scale) with structured benzodiazepine order sets'
- 'Step 2: Standardized dosing algorithms replace variable individual clinician judgment
  and practice patterns'
- 'Step 3: Symptom-triggered approach ensures medication administration matches actual
  withdrawal severity rather than fixed schedules'
- 'Step 4: Protocol adherence produces consistent, evidence-based benzodiazepine dosing
  across all patients regardless of treating clinician'
