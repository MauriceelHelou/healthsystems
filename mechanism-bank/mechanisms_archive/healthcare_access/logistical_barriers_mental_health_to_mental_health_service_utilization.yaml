mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural features of healthcare delivery create access barriers including
  transportation challenges, limited appointment availability, waitlists, and scheduling
  inflexibility'
- 'Step 2: Geographic distance from services, inadequate public transportation, and
  time constraints from work/family obligations impede ability to attend appointments'
- 'Step 3: Financial barriers including copayments, lost wages, and childcare costs
  increase opportunity costs of treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: However, study findings indicate logistical barriers were NOT primary correlates—problem
  recognition and treatment beliefs had stronger associations'
