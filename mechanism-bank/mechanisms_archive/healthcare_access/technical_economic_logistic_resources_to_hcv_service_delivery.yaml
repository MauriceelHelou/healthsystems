mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adequate technical, economic and logistic resources enable treatment centers
  to implement comprehensive HCV management protocols'
- 'Step 2: Resource availability allows for equipment, supplies, and infrastructure
  needed for screening and treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Economic resources support continuity of care including referral systems
  and harm reduction programs'
- 'Step 4: When resources are insufficient, all four service domains (screening, referral,
  treatment, harm reduction) are delivered to less than 50% of patients'
