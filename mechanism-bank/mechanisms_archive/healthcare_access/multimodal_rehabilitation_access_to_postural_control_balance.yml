- 'Step 1: Structured balance training exercises challenge proprioceptive systems'
- 'Step 2: Progressive neuromuscular training improves sensorimotor control'
- 'Step 3: Dynamic movement patterns restore functional stability'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced postural control reduces fall risk and re-injury'
