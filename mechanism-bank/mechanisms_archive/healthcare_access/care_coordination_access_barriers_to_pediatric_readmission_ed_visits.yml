mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural barriers prevent families from accessing adequate care coordination services'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to care coordination results in poor communication between healthcare providers'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate coordination leads to gaps in post-discharge follow-up and medication management'
- 'Step 4: Care gaps increase risk of complications requiring emergency department visits and readmissions'

structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reveals structural inequities in healthcare access where care coordination
    services are not universally accessible or adequately resourced. Access barriers disproportionately
    affect families with fewer resources, creating a system where those who most need coordination services
    are least able to access them
