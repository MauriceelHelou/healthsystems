category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oral short-acting nifedipine provides accessible route of administration
  that does not require IV access or specialized equipment'
- 'Step 2: Calcium channel blocker mechanism relaxes vascular smooth muscle, reducing
  peripheral vascular resistance'
- 'Step 3: Blood pressure reduction occurs through vasodilation, bringing systolic
  BP below 160 mmHg and diastolic BP below 110 mmHg'
- 'Step 4: Ease of oral administration may facilitate faster medication delivery in
  resource-limited settings or busy postpartum units'
