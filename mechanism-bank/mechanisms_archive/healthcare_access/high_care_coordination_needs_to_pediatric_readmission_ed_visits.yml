mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High care coordination needs indicate complex medical conditions requiring multiple healthcare
  providers'
- 'Step 2: Fragmented healthcare systems create gaps in communication and continuity of care'
- 'Step 3: Poor care coordination leads to missed follow-up appointments and medication management issues'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate coordination results in preventable complications and acute health episodes'

  description: Children with chronic diseases likely have higher care coordination needs and stronger
    association with adverse outcomes
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights structural deficiencies in healthcare system integration
    and coordination, particularly affecting children with complex medical needs. The burden falls disproportionately
    on families to navigate fragmented systems rather than healthcare systems being designed for seamless
    coordination
