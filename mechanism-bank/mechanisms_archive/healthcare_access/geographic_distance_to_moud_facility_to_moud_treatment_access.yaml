direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographic distance between residential location and nearest MOUD facility
  creates spatial barriers to treatment initiation and retention'
- 'Step 2: Greater distances increase transportation costs, time burden, and logistical
  complexity of accessing treatment services'
- 'Step 3: In areas dependent on single critical access providers, loss or closure
  of that facility creates substantial access gaps with large distance increases to
  alternative providers'
- 'Step 4: Reduced geographic access decreases likelihood of treatment seeking, treatment
  initiation, and ongoing treatment adherence'
