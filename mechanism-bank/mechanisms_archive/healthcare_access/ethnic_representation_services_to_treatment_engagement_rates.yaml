direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional drug and alcohol treatment services predominantly serve white
  ethnicity populations with limited British South Asian and Muslim representation'
- 'Step 2: Lack of diverse representation creates perception that services are not
  designed for or welcoming to minority ethnic communities'
- 'Step 3: Absence of culturally matched providers and service users reinforces sense
  of exclusion and cultural mismatch'
- 'Step 4: Low perceived cultural fit results in minimal engagement from British South
  Asian and Muslim community members despite substance use prevalence'
