- 'Step 1: Counties with available MAT providers create local treatment infrastructure
  and clinical expertise'
- 'Step 2: Court coordinators become aware of MAT options through community healthcare
  networks and provider availability'
- 'Step 3: Local availability reduces logistical barriers to coordinating MAT as part
  of court-supervised treatment plans'
- 'Step 4: Courts authorize MAT when they can feasibly refer participants to accessible
  treatment providers'
