category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public stigma (difference, disdain, and blame) creates widespread negative
  attitudes toward individuals with alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Stigmatizing social norms become internalized, creating shame and self-blame
  that discourage help-seeking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Anticipated discrimination and negative treatment from healthcare providers
  creates psychological barriers to treatment entry'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative stigma barriers result in only a minority of individuals with
  AUD seeking treatment, perpetuating the treatment gap'
