mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court-mandated treatment settings create structural coercion that removes
  patient autonomy and choice'
- 'Step 2: Mental health professionals incorporate patients'' wishes into treatment
  planning and allow some choice within mandatory framework'
- 'Step 3: Provision of limited autonomy and recognition of patient preferences counteracts
  the coercive nature of detention'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience increased sense of agency and control despite involuntary
  treatment context'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced perceived autonomy leads to greater engagement and motivation
  to participate in treatment activities'
