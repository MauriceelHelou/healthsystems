direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Unstable housing disrupts continuity of healthcare access and harm reduction
  service utilization'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing necessitates injection in public or shared spaces
  with contaminated environments'
- 'Step 3: Housing instability creates survival pressures leading to rushed injection
  practices and equipment sharing networks'
- 'Step 4: These structural conditions increase exposure to HCV through shared injection
  equipment and contaminated injection environments'

  description: The effect is substantially stronger in high-income countries (tPAF
    19.4%) compared to low-income and middle-income countries (tPAF 8.3%), reflecting
    structural differences in housing markets and prevalence of housing instability
