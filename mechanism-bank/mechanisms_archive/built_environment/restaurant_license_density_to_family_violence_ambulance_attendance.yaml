direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of restaurants with alcohol licenses increases normalized
  alcohol consumption in community dining contexts'
- 'Step 2: Restaurant alcohol service often accompanies meals over extended periods,
  enabling sustained alcohol consumption in socially acceptable settings'
- 'Step 3: Individuals consume alcohol quantities that impair cognitive function and
  emotional regulation despite social dining context'
- 'Step 4: Post-dining intoxication carries into domestic settings where alcohol-related
  aggression manifests as family violence'
- 'Step 5: Violence escalation necessitates emergency paramedic intervention for victim
  protection and medical care'
