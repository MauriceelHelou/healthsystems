direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intensive farming creates high-density aquaculture environments with increased
  stocking densities'
- 'Step 2: High-density conditions increase environmental stress and pathogen exposure
  among shrimp populations'
- 'Step 3: Chronic environmental stress suppresses baseline immune function in farmed
  shrimp'
- 'Step 4: Reduced immune capacity increases susceptibility to bacterial infections
  like Vibrio alginolyticus'
