direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substandard housing conditions include inadequate ventilation, moisture problems, and structural
  defects'
- 'Step 2: These conditions promote growth of allergens such as mold, dust mites, and pest infestations'
- 'Step 3: Residents experience chronic exposure to indoor allergens due to compromised housing envelope'
- 'Step 4: Sustained allergen exposure triggers allergic sensitization and ongoing allergic reactions'

  exposure and compromised indoor environmental conditions

  description: Aging manufactured homes are particularly susceptible to deterioration and may have higher
    rates of housing quality problems
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism highlights how housing as a structural determinant directly impacts
    health outcomes. The prevalence of substandard housing in the Alabama Black Belt reflects broader
    patterns of disinvestment and structural inequality in rural communities. The focus on housing quality
    avoids individual behavioral explanations and addresses environmental determinants of health.
