- 'Step 1: Abandoned and vacant properties represent physical disorder and disinvestment
  in neighborhood infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: These properties reduce natural surveillance and territorial functioning
  by eliminating resident presence and ''eyes on the street'''
- 'Step 3: Abandoned properties provide unsupervised spaces for illicit activities
  and reduce perceived legitimacy of social norms'
- 'Step 4: The combination of reduced surveillance, physical disorder, and weakened
  social control increases opportunities and motivations for violent interpersonal
  conflicts'
