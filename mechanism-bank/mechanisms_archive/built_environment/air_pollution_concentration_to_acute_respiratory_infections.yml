- 'Step 1: Air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, ozone) enter respiratory system through inhalation'
- 'Step 2: Pollutants cause inflammatory response in airways and lung tissue'
- 'Step 3: Inflammation compromises immune defense mechanisms in respiratory tract'
- 'Step 4: Weakened respiratory defenses increase susceptibility to viral and bacterial pathogens'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of acute respiratory infections develop'

description: Ambient air pollution directly causes acute respiratory infections in children through inflammatory
  damage to respiratory defense mechanisms, with effects varying significantly by geographic location
  and development status.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Risk varies across geographical regions depending on source of air pollution, duration
    of exposures and concentration levels. Magnitude of risk is much higher in children in developing
    countries compared with developed ones.
moderators:
- name: country_development_status
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Children in developing countries face much higher magnitude of risk due to higher pollution
    concentrations and longer exposure durations
- name: pollution_source_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Different pollution sources (industrial, vehicular, residential) create varying risk profiles
    and exposure patterns
- name: exposure_duration
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Longer duration exposures amplify inflammatory responses and immune system compromise
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism reflects structural inequities in environmental policy and industrial
    regulation. Children in developing countries face disproportionate risk due to weaker environmental
    protections, proximity to industrial pollution sources, and lack of clean energy infrastructure. Housing
    location relative to pollution sources is often determined by economic constraints and residential
    segregation patterns.
