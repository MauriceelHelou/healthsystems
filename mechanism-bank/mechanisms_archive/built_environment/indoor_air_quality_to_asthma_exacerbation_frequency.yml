mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor indoor air quality increases concentration of respiratory irritants and allergens'
- 'Step 2: Children with existing asthma have heightened sensitivity to airborne triggers'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to poor air quality causes bronchial inflammation and hyperresponsiveness'
- 'Step 4: Inflammatory cascade leads to increased frequency of asthma symptoms and attacks'

description: Indoor air quality mediates the relationship between housing conditions and asthma outcomes
  by creating a direct pathway for respiratory irritant exposure in children's primary living environment.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Indoor air quality is determined by structural housing factors beyond individual
    control. This mechanism highlights how environmental racism and residential segregation concentrate
    poor housing conditions in communities of color, creating systematic health disadvantages.
