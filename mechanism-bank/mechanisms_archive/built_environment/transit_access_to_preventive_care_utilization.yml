- 'Step 1: Adequate public transit access enables transportation to healthcare facilities for people without personal vehicles'
- 'Step 2: Reliable transit reduces time and cost barriers to scheduling and attending routine healthcare appointments'
- 'Step 3: Reduced transportation barriers decrease likelihood of missed appointments and delayed care'
- 'Step 4: Consistent access enables completion of preventive care sequences (vaccinations, screenings, follow-ups)'
- 'Step 5: Increased preventive care utilization leads to earlier detection, disease prevention, and better health outcomes'

  interpretation: 'Adults with limited public transit access are 22% more likely to forgo needed healthcare due to transportation barriers. Those reporting fair/poor transit access were 2.4 times more likely to miss care. Nearly 6 million Americans delayed medical care due to transportation barriers in 2017'

description: Transportation barriers are a significant obstacle to healthcare access, particularly for preventive care. Adults without vehicle access who report fair or poor public transit availability are significantly more likely to forgo needed healthcare. Transportation assistance interventions (bus passes, taxi vouchers, ride programs) have shown improvements in cancer screening rates, chronic disease management, and healthcare utilization. Public transit expansion particularly benefits Medicaid beneficiaries who disproportionately lack personal vehicles.

  equity_implications: Transportation barriers reflect structural inequalities in transit investment, healthcare facility siting, and economic conditions. Low-income populations are more likely to lack vehicles and live in areas with poor transit. Medicaid beneficiaries are disproportionately people with low incomes and people of color. Structural solutions include transit expansion, NEMT coverage, and healthcare facility siting in transit-accessible locations.
assumptions:
- Assumes healthcare facilities are not uniformly accessible by transit
- Assumes public transit is viable alternative to personal vehicle
- Assumes transit barriers affect appointment attendance
limitations:
- Systematic review found limited rigorous evidence on transportation intervention effectiveness
- Self-reported transit access may not accurately reflect objective accessibility
- Confounding by other socioeconomic factors correlated with transit access
- Effects may be context-dependent based on healthcare system characteristics
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Transit availability varies dramatically between urban, suburban, and rural areas
  relevant_geographies:
  - Urban areas have better transit but may have congestion/reliability issues
  - Suburban areas often lack transit connections to healthcare facilities
  - Rural areas face most severe transportation barriers due to distance and no transit
