mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Retail environments position alcohol advertising displays in prominent
  locations accessible to youth during routine shopping activities with family members'
- 'Step 2: In-store marketing creates repeated exposure opportunities through point-of-sale
  advertising that youth encounter regularly in their communities'
- 'Step 3: Physical retail spaces normalize alcohol presence in everyday environments,
  making alcohol products and brands familiar to young adolescents before legal purchasing
  age'
- 'Step 4: The built retail environment systematically exposes youth to alcohol marketing
  regardless of media consumption choices or parental supervision'
