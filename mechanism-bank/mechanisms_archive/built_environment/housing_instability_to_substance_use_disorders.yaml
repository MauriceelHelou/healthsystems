direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates chronic stress and lack of safe, stable environments
  for recovery'
- 'Step 2: Absence of secure housing reduces access to consistent healthcare services
  and treatment adherence for substance use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Unstable living conditions increase exposure to environmental triggers
  and social networks that may perpetuate substance use'
- 'Step 4: Lack of permanent address creates barriers to accessing social services,
  employment, and healthcare system navigation'
