mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry implements health warnings with substandard design features (mean
  font size 8.17-point for CMO guidelines, mean pregnancy logo size 5.95mm)'
- 'Step 2: Small font sizes and logos fall below visibility thresholds that would
  be accepted on other products with health effects'
- 'Step 3: Reduced legibility and visibility of pregnancy warnings limits consumer
  ability to perceive and process health risk information'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate information access reduces awareness of alcohol-pregnancy risks,
  potentially increasing prenatal alcohol exposure'
