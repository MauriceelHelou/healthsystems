mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-licence outlets (liquor stores, convenience stores selling alcohol
  for off-premises consumption) concentrate alcohol sales in specific geographic areas'
- 'Step 2: These outlets facilitate alcohol consumption in private and public spaces
  outside the outlet, reducing informal social controls'
- 'Step 3: Take-home alcohol enables extended consumption periods and drinking in
  unregulated spaces'
- 'Step 4: The combination of increased consumption and reduced oversight in residential/public
  areas creates conditions conducive to crime and disorder'
