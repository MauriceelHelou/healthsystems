structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism identifies homelessness as a structural determinant resulting from
    broader inequities in housing policy, economic systems, and social safety nets rather than individual
    failings. It demonstrates how lack of housing as a basic human right creates cascading health effects,
    emphasizing the need for housing-first approaches and structural interventions.
