direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HHI provides physical improvements (curtains, heaters, insulation)'
- 'Step 2: These modifications improve home''s ability to retain heat and reduce moisture'
- 'Step 3: Residents experience increased warmth and dryness throughout the home'
- 'Step 4: Previously unusable cold/damp rooms become habitable'

  modifications and equipment provision, enabling greater use of living spaces.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism shows how targeted housing policy interventions can address structural
    inadequacies in rental housing. However, it also reveals limits when underlying housing quality and
    energy affordability remain unaddressed. Equity implication: Program targets children at risk of housing-related
    illness, addressing health inequities through environmental modification rather than individual behavior
    change.'
