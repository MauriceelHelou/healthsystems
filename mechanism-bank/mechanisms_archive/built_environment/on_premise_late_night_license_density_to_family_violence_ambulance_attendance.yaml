direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of late-night on-premise alcohol outlets increases local
  availability and accessibility of alcohol during high-risk hours'
- 'Step 2: Extended hours of alcohol service facilitate prolonged drinking episodes
  and acute intoxication in community settings'
- 'Step 3: Acute alcohol intoxication impairs judgment, increases aggression, and
  reduces inhibitory control among potential perpetrators'
- 'Step 4: Intoxicated individuals return to domestic settings with elevated risk
  of violent behavior toward family and intimate partners'
- 'Step 5: Acute violence episodes trigger emergency paramedic response for victim
  injuries and crisis intervention'
