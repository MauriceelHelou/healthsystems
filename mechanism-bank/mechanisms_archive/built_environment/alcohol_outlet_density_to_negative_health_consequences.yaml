  node_id: negative_health_consequences
  node_name: Negative Health Consequences
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High outlet density increases physical availability and accessibility of
  alcohol in community settings'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability leads to greater population-level alcohol consumption
  and related harms'
- 'Step 3: Concentrated outlet density creates environments with higher rates of violence,
  injuries, and chronic disease'
- 'Step 4: Populations living in high outlet density areas experience disproportionate
  negative health outcomes'
