mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of packaged liquor outlets increases geographic accessibility
  and affordability of take-home alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Ready availability of packaged alcohol enables purchase of larger quantities
  for consumption in private domestic settings'
- 'Step 3: Home alcohol consumption occurs without social monitoring or service limitations
  present in on-premise venues'
- 'Step 4: Unregulated domestic drinking patterns lead to acute intoxication states
  that precipitate violence against family members and intimate partners'
- 'Step 5: Severe violence episodes require emergency paramedic response for victim
  injury treatment and crisis intervention'
