direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Areas with low alcohol outlet density create structural barriers to alcohol
  access for adolescents'
- 'Step 2: Reduced visibility of alcohol retail establishments decreases normalization
  and marketing exposure'
- 'Step 3: Lower physical availability requires greater effort for acquisition, reducing
  opportunistic consumption'
- 'Step 4: These protective environmental factors result in lower overall alcohol
  consumption among adolescents'
