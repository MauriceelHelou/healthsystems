direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural/remote locations have poor network coverage limiting communication
  with emergency services'
- 'Step 2: Greater distance to backup support delays response times during violent
  incidents'
- 'Step 3: Increased weapon accessibility in rural areas elevates risk of armed violence'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare workers face prolonged exposure to violent situations without
  immediate support'
