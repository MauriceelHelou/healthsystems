- 'Step 1: Presence and use of televisions/electronic devices in sleep environment
  exposes individuals to blue light and stimulating content'
- 'Step 2: Blue light exposure suppresses melatonin production and disrupts circadian
  rhythm regulation'
- 'Step 3: Circadian disruption increases sleep latency, reduces sleep efficiency,
  and fragments sleep architecture'
- 'Step 4: Chronic sleep disruption accumulates to produce poor sleep quality and
  associated health consequences'
