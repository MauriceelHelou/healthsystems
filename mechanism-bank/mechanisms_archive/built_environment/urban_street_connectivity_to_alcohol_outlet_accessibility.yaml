direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher street connectivity creates more routes and pathways to access alcohol
  outlets from school locations'
- 'Step 2: Greater network connectivity reduces actual travel distance compared to
  straight-line distance'
- 'Step 3: Dense street networks facilitate multiple points of access to retail environments'
- 'Step 4: Increased accessibility through connected street networks enhances functional
  exposure to alcohol retail'
