category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative density of all alcohol outlet types creates neighborhood environments
  characterized by high alcohol availability and accessibility'
- 'Step 2: Multiple outlet types operating simultaneously provide continuous temporal
  and spatial access to alcohol across different consumption contexts'
- 'Step 3: Ubiquitous alcohol availability normalizes frequent and heavy drinking
  as part of neighborhood culture and routine activities'
- 'Step 4: Population-level increases in alcohol consumption and intoxication episodes
  elevate aggregate risk of domestic violence incidents'
- 'Step 5: Higher baseline violence rates generate increased demand for emergency
  paramedic services for family violence-related crises'
