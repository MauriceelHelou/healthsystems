mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-detecting ignition interlock devices are installed in vehicles
  as a vehicle-based safety feature'
- 'Step 2: These devices prevent vehicle operation when alcohol is detected above
  a preset threshold'
- 'Step 3: Physical separation of alcohol consumption from driving capability is achieved
  through technological barrier'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in alcohol-impaired driving events occurs among vehicles equipped
  with interlocks'
- 'Step 5: Decreased frequency of alcohol-related crashes and fatalities results from
  reduced exposure to impaired driving'
