mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing conditions enable mold growth and other biological contaminants in indoor environments'
- 'Step 2: Mold spores and mycotoxins become airborne and are inhaled by residents'
- 'Step 3: These biological allergens trigger immediate hypersensitivity reactions in sensitized individuals'
- 'Step 4: Repeated exposure leads to chronic airway inflammation and increased asthma symptom frequency'

description: Biological exposures, particularly mold, were among the most commonly assessed indoor environmental
  exposures associated with asthma outcomes in the reviewed literature.

  description: 54% of studies focused on childhood asthma, indicating particular vulnerability in pediatric
    populations
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Biological exposures reflect inadequate housing maintenance and ventilation systems,
    often concentrated in rental properties and low-income housing where tenants have limited control
    over housing conditions.
