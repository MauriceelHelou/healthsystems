- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets increases physical availability and accessibility
  of alcohol in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol availability leads to greater alcohol consumption and
  congregation of people in areas with outlets'
- 'Step 3: Greater alcohol consumption and congregation patterns in retail areas increase
  opportunities for crime and disorder'
- 'Step 4: These effects persist independently of general retail activity patterns
  and are specific to alcohol outlets'
