mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism and disinvestment create unequal distribution of parks,
  recreation facilities, and safe walkable spaces across racial lines'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to safe exercise spaces reduces opportunities for physical
  activity in African American communities'
- 'Step 3: Reduced physical activity opportunities contribute to lower energy expenditure
  and sedentary behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Decreased physical activity combined with other factors increases risk
  of obesity development'
