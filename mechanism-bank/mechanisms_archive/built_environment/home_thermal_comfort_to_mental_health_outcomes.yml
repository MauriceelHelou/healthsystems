description: Improved home thermal environment enhances mental health through reduced environmental stress
  and increased functional living space.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism shows how housing quality directly affects mental health through
    environmental pathways, not individual behaviors. It addresses how structural housing inadequacies
    create chronic stress. The intervention recognizes housing as a social determinant of mental health,
    particularly important for families with children at risk.
