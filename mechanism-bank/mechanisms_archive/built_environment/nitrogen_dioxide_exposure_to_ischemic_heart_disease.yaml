direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic NO2 exposure from traffic-related air pollution creates sustained
  oxidative stress in coronary vasculature'
- 'Step 2: Oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators promote coronary atherosclerosis
  and plaque formation'
- 'Step 3: Progressive coronary artery disease reduces myocardial blood flow and oxygen
  delivery'
- 'Step 4: Myocardial ischemia manifests as clinical ischemic heart disease including
  angina and myocardial infarction'

  description: Older adults in cohort (mean age 52.0 years, range 30-79) likely have
    greater vulnerability to air pollution effects on coronary arteries due to age-related
    vascular changes

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Longer duration of NO2 exposure would allow greater accumulation of
    vascular damage and atherosclerotic plaque burden
