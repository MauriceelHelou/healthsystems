direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Growing population in a block group increases the customer base and market
  demand for food service establishments'
- 'Step 2: Restaurants (which serve alcohol alongside food) respond to increased market
  opportunity by opening new locations'
- 'Step 3: Commercial zoning and development patterns accommodate expanded retail
  infrastructure to serve larger populations'
- 'Step 4: Restaurant counts increase proportionally with population growth over time'
