direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Suboptimal room temperature disrupts thermoregulation needed for sleep
  initiation and maintenance'
- 'Step 2: Temperature dysregulation interferes with normal sleep architecture and
  circadian rhythm alignment'
- 'Step 3: Poor environmental temperature control reduces sleep efficiency, increases
  wake after sleep onset, and prolongs sleep latency'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated sleep disruption results in poor overall sleep quality and
  self-reported dissatisfaction with sleep experience'
