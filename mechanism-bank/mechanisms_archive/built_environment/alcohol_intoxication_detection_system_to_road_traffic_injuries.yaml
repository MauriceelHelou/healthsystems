- 'Step 1: In-vehicle camera-based ML system detects blood alcohol concentration (BAC)
  at critical thresholds (≥0.05 g/dL WHO legal limit) with 75% accuracy through facial
  features'
- 'Step 2: Real-time detection of alcohol impairment enables immediate intervention
  to prevent impaired drivers from operating vehicles'
- 'Step 3: Prevention of drunk driving reduces alcohol-related road accidents, which
  contribute significantly to global burden of road injuries'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in drunk driving incidents decreases traffic fatalities and serious
  injuries'
