- 'Step 1: Integrated safety system with ESP32, MQ3 sensor, relay, and GPS monitors
  driver behavior in real-time'
- 'Step 2: System detects overspeeding (>95% accuracy) and triggers immediate email
  alerts to authorities/stakeholders'
- 'Step 3: System detects alcohol consumption and physically prevents engine ignition,
  blocking intoxicated driving attempts'
- 'Step 4: Dual prevention framework eliminates primary behavioral risk factors (speeding
  and drunk driving) at point of occurrence'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in overspeeding and drunk driving incidents directly decreases
  road traffic accidents and associated injuries/fatalities'
