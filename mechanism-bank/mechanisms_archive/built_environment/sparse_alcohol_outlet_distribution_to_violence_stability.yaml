direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sparse distribution of alcohol outlets limits geographic accessibility
  to alcohol retail locations'
- 'Step 2: Lower accessibility reduces both the volume of alcohol purchases and the
  concentration of alcohol consumption in specific geographic areas'
- 'Step 3: Dispersed consumption patterns prevent the formation of hotspots where
  intoxicated individuals congregate'
- 'Step 4: Absence of concentrated drinking areas maintains lower baseline risk for
  violence escalation in the neighborhood'

  description: In areas with initially low violence rates, sparse outlet distribution
    helps maintain stability and prevents transitions to higher violence states.
