- 'Step 1: GPS technology embedded in vehicle safety system provides continuous real-time
  location tracking'
- 'Step 2: In event of traffic incident, precise vehicle location data immediately
  available to emergency services'
- 'Step 3: Elimination of location uncertainty and search time enables faster emergency
  responder dispatch'
- 'Step 4: Reduced response time improves access to time-sensitive medical care for
  crash victims'
