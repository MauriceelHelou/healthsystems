mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Poor housing quality encompasses multiple environmental hazards (moisture, ventilation, structural
  integrity)'
- 'Step 2: Inadequate ventilation systems fail to remove indoor air pollutants and allergens'
- 'Step 3: Structural defects allow entry of outdoor pollutants and pest allergens'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to multiple respiratory irritants creates chronic airway inflammation'
- 'Step 5: Sustained inflammation increases asthma risk and symptom severity'

description: Housing quality factors are closely linked to asthma occurrence in adults. Poor quality housing
  creates multiple pathways for respiratory hazard exposure through inadequate environmental controls.
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Authors note asthma prevalence in Quito is relatively low compared to other Latin American
    cities, suggesting geographic variation in housing quality impacts
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Housing quality reflects structural economic inequities and policy failures in
    building regulation and enforcement. Low-income populations face constrained housing choices, often
    relegated to substandard housing due to affordability constraints and residential segregation. Housing
    quality is determined by zoning policies, building codes, inspection enforcement, and economic accessibility
    rather than individual preferences. This creates systematic health inequities based on economic position
    and geographic location.
