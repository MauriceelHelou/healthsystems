direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permissive alcohol control policies create widespread physical and economic
  availability of alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: High availability normalizes alcohol consumption through increased exposure
  and marketing'
- 'Step 3: Easy physical and economic access reduces barriers to initiation and regular
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Increased population-level consumption generates significant health, social,
  and economic burden'
