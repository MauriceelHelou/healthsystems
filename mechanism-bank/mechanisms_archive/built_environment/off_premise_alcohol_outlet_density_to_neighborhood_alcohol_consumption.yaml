direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of off-premise outlets reduces physical and economic barriers
  to alcohol purchase'
- 'Step 2: Increased availability and accessibility promotes more frequent purchasing
  opportunities'
- 'Step 3: Marketing, signage, and visual cues from multiple outlets normalize alcohol
  consumption in the neighborhood environment'
- 'Step 4: Aggregate purchasing and consumption increases at the neighborhood level,
  creating population-level exposure to intoxicated individuals'
