- 'Step 1: Smart helmet with touch sensors enforces helmet wearing by preventing ignition
  when helmet is not worn'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol sensors detect intoxication and automatically lock ignition, preventing
  inebriated riding'
- 'Step 3: GPS and cloud communication enable real-time monitoring and emergency response
  coordination'
- 'Step 4: Automated alerts to police and emergency contacts reduce response times
  when accidents occur'
