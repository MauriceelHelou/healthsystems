  interpretation: 'Each 10 ug/m3 increase in PM2.5 is associated with 8% increased all-cause mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.09). In Medicare population (61 million), effect was 7.3% per 10 ug/m3. Effects are linear or supra-linear at low concentrations, with no safe threshold identified.'

description: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 air pollution increases all-cause mortality through cardiovascular and respiratory pathways. Meta-analyses consistently show 6-14% increased mortality risk per 10 ug/m3, with effects evident even at levels below current regulatory standards. The WHO estimates 8.9 million deaths annually attributable to PM2.5 globally.

  equity_implications: Air pollution exposure is not randomly distributed. Low-income communities and communities of color are systematically located near highways, industrial facilities, and other pollution sources due to historical redlining, exclusionary zoning, and environmental racism. Clean Air Act enforcement varies by region and political context. Addressing air pollution mortality requires structural interventions including emissions regulations, land use policy, and environmental justice enforcement rather than individual protective behaviors.
assumptions:
- PM2.5 used as indicator pollutant; effects may include correlated pollutants
- Long-term exposure (annual average) is primary exposure metric
- Mortality effects are independent of smoking and other individual risk factors after adjustment
limitations:
- Heterogeneity across studies in exposure assessment methods
- Most studies from North America and Europe; global estimates extrapolated
- Difficult to separate PM2.5 effects from co-pollutants and noise
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: PM2.5 concentrations range from <5 ug/m3 in rural areas to >15 ug/m3 in urban/industrial areas. Effects per unit exposure are similar across regions, but total burden depends on concentration levels.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Urban areas with high traffic density
  - Regions near industrial facilities and power plants
  - Wildfire-affected regions (increasing exposure)
  - Areas with weak Clean Air Act enforcement
