  air toxics and hazardous pollutants'
- 'Step 2: Residential proximity creates chronic exposure to carcinogenic compounds
  (benzene, formaldehyde, PAHs, heavy metals)'
- 'Step 3: Discriminatory zoning and housing markets concentrate low-income communities
  and communities of color near polluting facilities'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure over time increases cellular damage and cancer initiation
  pathways'
- 'Step 5: Elevated cancer incidence in fenceline communities reflects exposure disparities'

  interpretation: Industrial facility proximity creates cancer risk gradients that
    reflect structural patterns of environmental racism, with communities of color
    and low-income populations bearing disproportionate exposure

version: '1.0'
description: Proximity to industrial pollution sources (refineries, chemical plants,
  hazardous waste sites) increases cancer risk through chronic exposure to carcinogenic
  air toxics. Environmental justice research demonstrates that polluting facilities
  are disproportionately sited in low-income communities and communities of color
  due to discriminatory zoning, lower land costs, and reduced political power. Cancer
  risk varies 2.71-fold between high and low structural racism states.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: environmental_racism
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Industrial facility siting reflects historical and ongoing
    environmental racism. Communities of color and low-income communities face elevated
    cancer risk due to discriminatory zoning, housing market dynamics, and political
    disenfranchisement that prevents effective resistance to polluting facilities.
    Solutions require environmental justice enforcement, pollution reduction, and
    community empowerment rather than expecting residents to relocate.
assumptions:
- Cancer risk assessed from EPA National Air Toxics Assessment
- Proximity defined as residence within buffer zones of industrial facilities
- Exposure-cancer link established for specific compounds (benzene, formaldehyde,
  etc.)
limitations:
- Ecological studies cannot establish individual-level causation
- Latency period makes cancer attribution to specific exposures difficult
- Measurement of actual exposure (vs. proximity) limited
- Confounding by socioeconomic factors difficult to fully address
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Industrial facility density and type varies by region, with concentration
    in Gulf Coast, industrial Midwest, and urban areas.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Gulf Coast petrochemical corridor (Cancer Alley)
  - Industrial Midwest cities
  - Ports and rail hubs with freight pollution
