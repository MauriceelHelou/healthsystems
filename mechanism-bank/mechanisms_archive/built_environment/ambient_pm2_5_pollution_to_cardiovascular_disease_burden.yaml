direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) enters the respiratory system through
  inhalation'
- 'Step 2: PM2.5 particles trigger systemic inflammation and oxidative stress throughout
  the cardiovascular system'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory processes lead to endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis
  progression, and increased thrombotic risk'
- 'Step 4: These pathophysiological changes result in increased incidence of cardiovascular
  disease events and disability'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated cardiovascular morbidity and premature mortality contribute
  to population-level disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)'
