mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke from household members creates persistent indoor air pollution'
- 'Step 2: Children are exposed to smoke particles and chemicals that penetrate lung tissue'
- 'Step 3: Tobacco smoke causes direct irritation and inflammation of developing airways'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure increases risk of asthma development and exacerbation of existing asthma'

description: Second-hand tobacco smoke was identified as one of the most frequently assessed indoor environmental
  exposures, particularly in studies focusing on childhood asthma outcomes.

  description: Overcrowded housing conditions may increase exposure intensity and duration

  equity_implications: Tobacco smoke exposure reflects both individual behaviors and structural factors
    including housing density, ventilation quality, and economic stressors that contribute to smoking
    rates. Children have no control over their exposure environment.
