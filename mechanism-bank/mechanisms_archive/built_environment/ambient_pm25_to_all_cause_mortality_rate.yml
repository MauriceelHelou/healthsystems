  - "Step 1: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5 <2.5 micrometers) from combustion, traffic, industry enters respiratory system"
  - "Step 2: PM2.5 penetrates deep into alveoli and crosses into bloodstream"
  - "Step 3: Systemic inflammation triggered by particle deposition and oxidative stress"
  - "Step 4: Chronic inflammation accelerates atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease progression"
  - "Step 5: Pulmonary inflammation impairs lung function and increases respiratory disease risk"
  - "Step 6: Elevated mortality from cardiovascular events (MI, stroke), respiratory failure, and lung cancer"

  interpretation: "Each 10 micrograms/m3 increase in long-term PM2.5 exposure increases all-cause mortality risk by 8% (RR 1.08). Cardiovascular mortality shows 11% increase, respiratory mortality 9% increase, and lung cancer mortality 12% increase. Effects persist at levels below WHO guidelines (10 micrograms/m3)."

description: "Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases all-cause mortality through cardiovascular, respiratory, and carcinogenic pathways. WHO-commissioned systematic review of 107 predominantly cohort studies found consistent 8% mortality increase per 10 micrograms/m3, with effects observed even below current air quality guidelines."

  equity_implications: "PM2.5 exposure is inequitably distributed by race and income due to historical zoning, redlining, and industrial siting decisions. Black and Latino communities face 28-56% higher PM2.5 exposure than white communities in the US. Environmental justice requires addressing root causes of disparate exposure through policy interventions including zoning reform, industrial regulation, and clean energy transitions."
assumptions:
  - "Linear dose-response relationship (may underestimate effects at low levels)"
  - "PM2.5 composition varies by source but effects are broadly consistent"
  - "Cohort follow-up adequately captures long-term exposure effects"
limitations:
  - "High heterogeneity (I-squared 89%) across studies"
  - "Ecological fallacy possible in area-level exposure assessment"
  - "Confounding by co-pollutants (NO2, O3) difficult to isolate"
  - "Indoor air quality not captured in ambient monitoring"
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: "PM2.5 levels and composition vary substantially by region based on sources (traffic, industry, agriculture, wildfires). Urban areas typically higher than rural. Western US increasingly affected by wildfire smoke. Effects observed across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific."
  relevant_geographies:
    - "California Central Valley (agriculture + traffic)"
    - "Northeast corridor (traffic + industry)"
    - "Western states (increasing wildfire contribution)"
    - "Industrial regions worldwide"
