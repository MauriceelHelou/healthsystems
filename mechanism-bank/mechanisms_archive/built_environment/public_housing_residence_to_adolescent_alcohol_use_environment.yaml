mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public housing policy concentrates low-income families in specific geographic
  areas, typically in high-poverty neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Concentration of poverty in public housing neighborhoods creates structural
  conditions including limited economic opportunities, reduced social services, and
  potentially higher alcohol outlet density'
- 'Step 3: These neighborhood structural features shape the social environment and
  availability of alcohol for adolescents'
- 'Step 4: Baseline binge drinking prevalence in control group (3.2%) and treatment
  group (3.9%) demonstrates alcohol exposure exists across low-income housing contexts'

  description: Multi-site design across five cities suggests that local public housing
    characteristics and neighborhood alcohol environments may moderate baseline exposure
    levels and intervention effects.
