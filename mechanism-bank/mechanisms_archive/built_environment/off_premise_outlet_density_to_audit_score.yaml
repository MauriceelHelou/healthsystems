mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Off-premise outlet density does not directly affect AUDIT scores when area
  income is controlled'
- 'Step 2: The relationship between outlets and alcohol problems is confounded by
  neighborhood economic characteristics'
- 'Step 3: Prior associations between outlet density and problems may reflect underlying
  socioeconomic segregation'
- 'Step 4: Area income, not outlet availability, is the primary structural determinant
  of alcohol use disorders'
