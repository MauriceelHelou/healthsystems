mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: TiO2 NPs are ingested from everyday consumer products during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: TiO2 NPs accumulate in maternal organs including liver, kidney, and spleen'
- 'Step 3: Nanoparticles trigger pathological alterations in these organs'
- 'Step 4: Kidney GBM destruction occurs, leading to proteinuria and hypertension'
