category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MQ3 alcohol sensor continuously monitors driver''s alcohol consumption
  in real-time'
- 'Step 2: Upon detection of alcohol above threshold, system activates relay mechanism'
- 'Step 3: Relay physically inhibits engine ignition, preventing vehicle operation'
- 'Step 4: Physical prevention eliminates opportunity for drunk driving regardless
  of driver intention or judgment impairment'
