direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High off-premise outlet density may indicate areas with different socioeconomic
  or demographic characteristics'
- 'Step 2: These areas may have different social patterns around alcohol procurement
  and consumption'
- 'Step 3: Higher outlet density may be associated with lower-income areas where drinking
  frequency is lower despite availability'
- 'Step 4: Contextual factors related to outlet density location (not density itself)
  influence drinking patterns'
