  interpretation: Each 1 degree C increase in heat exposure raises preterm birth odds
    by 4% (OR 1.04); heat waves increase preterm birth risk by 26% (OR 1.26). This
    represents a substantial population health burden given climate change projections.

description: Heat exposure during pregnancy is significantly associated with increased
  risk of preterm birth and other adverse birth outcomes. A meta-analysis of 196 studies
  from 66 countries found preterm birth odds increase 4% per 1 degree C rise (OR 1.04)
  and 26% during heat waves (OR 1.26). Stillbirth and low birth weight also show elevated
  risk. Climate change will amplify these effects, disproportionately affecting communities
  with limited cooling resources.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: climate_systems
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Heat-related pregnancy risks reflect structural inequities
    in climate vulnerability. Low-income pregnant individuals, outdoor workers, and
    those in poorly-cooled housing face disproportionate exposure. Black and Hispanic
    mothers face compounding risks from environmental racism (heat islands in segregated
    neighborhoods) and occupational exposures. Climate adaptation must prioritize
    pregnant workers and cooling access for vulnerable communities.
assumptions:
- Heat exposure measured as ambient temperature or heat wave occurrence
- Preterm birth defined as delivery before 37 weeks gestation
- Effect is acute rather than cumulative chronic exposure
limitations:
- Heat exposure measurement varies across studies (ambient vs. personal)
- Potential confounding by air pollution which co-varies with temperature
- Publication bias possible toward significant findings
- Limited ability to identify critical windows of vulnerability
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Heat exposure and vulnerability vary by climate zone, urbanicity,
    and socioeconomic geography.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Tropical and subtropical regions face highest baseline exposure
  - Urban heat islands amplify exposure in cities
  - Low-income neighborhoods with poor housing stock most vulnerable
