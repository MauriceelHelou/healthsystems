mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Festive venues lack adequate security measures to detect and prevent needle
  pricking'
- 'Step 2: Over half of patients (>50%) displayed physical examination findings consistent
  with needle pricking, primarily on arms'
- 'Step 3: Assailants can operate with impunity in crowded venues without detection'
- 'Step 4: Victims sustain physical injury from needle pricking and psychological
  trauma from assault'
