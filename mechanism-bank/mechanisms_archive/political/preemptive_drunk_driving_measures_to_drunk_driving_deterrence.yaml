direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Preemptive measures (random breath testing, BAC limits, sobriety checkpoints)
  increase perceived risk of detection'
- 'Step 2: Higher detection risk deters individuals from driving after drinking through
  fear of consequences'
- 'Step 3: Consistent enforcement across these measures creates comprehensive deterrence
  network'
- 'Step 4: Result is reduced drunk-driving incidence and associated traffic injuries/deaths'
