mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State minimum wage increases above federal level raise income for low-wage workers, many of whom are women of reproductive age'
- 'Step 2: Increased household income improves maternal nutrition, prenatal care access, and reduces stress during pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Higher wages reduce need for multiple jobs or excessive work hours, allowing time for prenatal appointments and rest'
- 'Step 4: Reduced economic hardship decreases likelihood of housing instability and food insecurity during pregnancy'
- 'Step 5: Improved material conditions and reduced chronic stress lead to better birth outcomes and lower postneonatal mortality'

description: Higher minimum wages are associated with reduced infant mortality and improved birth outcomes. Analysis of U.S. state-level variation from 1980-2011 found that each $1 increase in the minimum wage above the federal level was associated with a 4% decrease in postneonatal mortality. If all states in 2014 had increased their minimum wages by $1, there would have been an estimated 2,790 fewer low birth weight births and 518 fewer postneonatal deaths.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: policy_structural
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Minimum wage policy represents structural intervention affecting wages for the lowest-paid workers, who are disproportionately women and minorities. Infant mortality disparities by race and income reflect downstream effects of wage policy decisions. Structural solution targets economic determinants rather than individual maternal behavior.
assumptions:
- Assumes minimum wage affects wages of women of reproductive age
- Assumes income effects operate through material conditions (nutrition, housing, care access)
- Assumes stress pathway contributes to birth outcomes
limitations:
- Observational design cannot definitively establish causation
- Effects may be confounded by other state policies that correlate with minimum wage increases
- Analysis period (1980-2011) may not generalize to current context
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects vary by baseline minimum wage level, cost of living, and social safety net strength
  relevant_geographies:
  - Effects concentrated among low-income populations
  - Southern states with large Black populations and lower wages may show larger effects
  - Urban areas with higher cost of living may show different effect magnitudes
