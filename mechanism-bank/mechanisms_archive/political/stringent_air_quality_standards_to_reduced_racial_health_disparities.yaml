direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: More stringent air quality standards require greater pollution reductions
  across all areas'
- 'Step 2: Areas with highest baseline pollution (disproportionately minoritized communities)
  experience largest absolute reductions'
- 'Step 3: Greater reductions in high-exposure communities lead to larger decreases
  in pollution-attributable health burdens'
- 'Step 4: Differential benefit to marginalized communities reduces relative disparities
  in health outcomes'
- 'Step 5: Both NO2 and PM2.5 standards would need strengthening to achieve equitable
  health outcomes'
