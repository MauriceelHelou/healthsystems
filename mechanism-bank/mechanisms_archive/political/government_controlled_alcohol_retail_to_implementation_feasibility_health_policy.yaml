direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government ownership and control of alcohol retail (liquor stores) centralizes
  decision-making authority over retail practices'
- 'Step 2: Centralized control enables uniform implementation of warning label policies
  across all points of alcohol sale'
- 'Step 3: Elimination of multiple private stakeholder negotiations simplifies policy
  adoption and compliance monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced feasibility allows testing of population health interventions
  like warning labels that can increase health knowledge and support safer consumption'
