direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Web-based RBS training standardizes instruction quality and curriculum
  implementation across all servers, eliminating instructor-to-instructor variability
  present in live training'
- 'Step 2: Standardized training provides consistent education on recognizing intoxication
  signs and legal/policy requirements for refusing service'
- 'Step 3: Trained servers apply consistent decision-making protocols when encountering
  apparently intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 4: Increased refusal rates reduce alcohol service to intoxicated individuals
  at the point of sale'
