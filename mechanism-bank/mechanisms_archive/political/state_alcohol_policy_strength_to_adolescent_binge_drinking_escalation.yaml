  node_name: Adolescent Binge Drinking Escalation Trajectory
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stronger state alcohol policies create regulatory barriers to alcohol access
  through enforcement mechanisms (e.g., ID checks, penalties for sales to minors,
  restrictions on marketing)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced structural availability and accessibility of alcohol decreases
  opportunities for underage youth to obtain alcohol in their environment'
- 'Step 3: Lower environmental exposure to alcohol reduces initiation and escalation
  of binge drinking behaviors during critical developmental periods from adolescence
  to early adulthood'
- 'Step 4: Youth who face structural barriers to alcohol access are less likely to
  develop escalating consumption patterns compared to low-risk trajectories'
