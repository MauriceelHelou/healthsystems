direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current legislation does not adequately regulate alcohol advertising disclosures
  on social networking sites'
- 'Step 2: Influencers post branded alcohol content without required ''#ad'' or sponsorship
  disclosures, even when posts are commercially motivated'
- 'Step 3: Youth are unable to identify commercial content, perceiving alcohol posts
  as authentic personal recommendations'
- 'Step 4: Covert marketing exposure increases alcohol consumption as youth lack critical
  awareness of commercial intent behind influencer content'
