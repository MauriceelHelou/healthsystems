mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inaccurate alcohol outlet data undermines ability to identify high-density
  areas for targeted interventions'
- 'Step 2: Policy decisions based on flawed data may miss critical outlets or misallocate
  enforcement resources'
- 'Step 3: Research studies using different data sources produce non-comparable estimates
  of outlet density and effects'
- 'Step 4: Community organizations lack reliable information to advocate for zoning
  changes or licensing restrictions'
- 'Step 5: Systematic data gaps in low-income areas mean these communities receive
  less effective alcohol harm reduction despite potentially greater need'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Data discrepancies are 5-fold higher in low-income areas (IR=4.990),
    meaning intervention effectiveness is most compromised in communities facing greatest
    alcohol-related harm
- name: rural_location
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Non-urban areas show 62% more data discrepancies, undermining intervention
    capacity in rural communities already facing healthcare access barriers
- name: state_data_systems
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: States with integrated data systems (like Oregon) show minimal discrepancies,
    demonstrating that policy investment in data infrastructure can enable effective
    interventions across all communities
