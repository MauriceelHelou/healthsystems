direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Marijuana metabolites have limited detection window in biological samples
  compared to other substances'
- 'Step 2: Crash investigations involve procedural delays before biological samples
  can be collected from drivers'
- 'Step 3: By the time samples are collected, marijuana metabolites may have degraded
  below detectable levels'
- 'Step 4: Lack of detectable evidence prevents documentation of marijuana impairment
  in crash records and surveillance systems'
