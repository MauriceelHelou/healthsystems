mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of regulations limiting alcohol content in single-serving products
  allows supersized alcopops with very high alcohol quantities per can'
- 'Step 2: Single-serving packaging creates normative expectation that one container
  equals one serving, regardless of actual alcohol content'
- 'Step 3: Young adults consume entire cans as single servings, unaware they are consuming
  multiple standard drinks'
- 'Step 4: This leads to rapid consumption of large alcohol quantities and underestimation
  of intoxication levels, increasing risk for impaired driving and other harms'
