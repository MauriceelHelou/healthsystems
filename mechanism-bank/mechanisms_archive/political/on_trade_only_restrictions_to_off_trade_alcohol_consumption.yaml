mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 restrictions targeted only on-trade premises (bars, restaurants)
  while off-trade (retail stores) remained open'
- 'Step 2: Asymmetric policy approach maintained or increased alcohol availability
  through retail channels'

  home consumption'
- 'Step 4: Licensing stakeholders highlighted this substitution effect as creating
  long-term public health risks'
