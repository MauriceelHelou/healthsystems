description: Public investment in housing remediation funding creates direct improvements in children's
  asthma outcomes by addressing structural environmental triggers at their source.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: Remediation funding represents a structural intervention that addresses root causes
    rather than treating downstream symptoms. The need for public funding highlights how market failures
    leave low-income families unable to afford necessary housing improvements, requiring policy intervention
    to achieve health equity.
