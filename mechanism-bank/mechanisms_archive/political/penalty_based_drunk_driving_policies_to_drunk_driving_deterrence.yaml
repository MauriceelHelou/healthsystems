direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Penalties (fines, detention, license suspension, vehicle impoundment) impose
  costs on drunk driving'
- 'Step 2: Anticipated costs create deterrent effect for potential drunk drivers'
- 'Step 3: Penalties are widely adopted across countries making them politically feasible'
- 'Step 4: However, penalties alone do not address underlying alcohol use disorders,
  limiting long-term effectiveness'
