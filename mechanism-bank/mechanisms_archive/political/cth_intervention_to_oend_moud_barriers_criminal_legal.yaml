direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CTH intervention engages criminal-legal system stakeholders in coalition
  to address overdose risk in justice-involved populations'
- 'Step 2: Coalition activities work to reduce institutional barriers, policy restrictions,
  and stigma in jails, prisons, probation, and parole settings'
- 'Step 3: Intervention effectiveness varies significantly by research site, suggesting
  local policy and political contexts moderate impact'
- 'Step 4: In some communities, perceived barriers to providing harm reduction and
  treatment in criminal-legal settings decrease'
