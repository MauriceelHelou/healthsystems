mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower BAC limit creates legal deterrent against driving with alcohol impairment'
- 'Step 2: Reduced prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving decreases overall crash
  incidence'
- 'Step 3: Lower driver BAC levels in remaining crashes reduce injury severity through
  improved reaction time and decision-making'
- 'Step 4: Combined reduction in crash frequency and severity decreases total injury
  burden'

  description: Injury reductions show same sensitivity to compliance as fatalities,
    with realistic scenarios (4-16%) versus complete compliance scenarios (71-99%)

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Policy affects both crash incidence and injury severity, with lower
    BAC levels reducing severity of injuries sustained in crashes that still occur
