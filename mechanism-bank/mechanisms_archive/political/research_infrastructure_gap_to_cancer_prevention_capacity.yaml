mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited research infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa results in absence
  of cohort studies and validated dietary assessment instruments'
- 'Step 2: Methodological limitations prevent comprehensive measurement of risk factors
  like alcohol, smoking, and diet-cancer interactions'
- 'Step 3: Evidence gaps prevent development of context-appropriate, evidence-based
  cancer prevention policies and interventions'
- 'Step 4: Without region-specific evidence, cancer incidence continues to rise rapidly
  without effective prevention strategies'
