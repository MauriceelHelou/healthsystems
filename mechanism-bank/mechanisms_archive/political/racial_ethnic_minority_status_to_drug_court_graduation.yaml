mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Drug court program requirements and supervision practices may not account
  for structural barriers faced disproportionately by racial/ethnic minorities'
- 'Step 2: Differential access to transportation, employment flexibility, childcare,
  and social support affects ability to meet program requirements'
- 'Step 3: Custody sanctions are applied differentially and may reflect implicit biases
  in monitoring and enforcement'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative disadvantages and sanction exposure reduce likelihood of program
  completion for minority participants'
