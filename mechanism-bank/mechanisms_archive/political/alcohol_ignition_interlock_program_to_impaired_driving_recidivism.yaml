mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol ignition interlock devices are installed in vehicles of convicted
  drink drivers, requiring breath alcohol testing before vehicle operation'
- 'Step 2: Interlock devices prevent vehicle operation when blood alcohol concentration
  exceeds programmed threshold, creating a technological barrier to impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: Continuous monitoring and logged events create accountability and enforcement
  mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Program participation creates behavior modification through immediate consequences
  and deterrence'
- 'Step 5: Reduced opportunities for impaired driving lead to decreased recidivism
  rates among participants'
