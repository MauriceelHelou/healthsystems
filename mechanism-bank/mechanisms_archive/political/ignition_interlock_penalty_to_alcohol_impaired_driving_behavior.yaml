- 'Step 1: Mandatory ignition interlock device installation creates a credible threat
  of vehicle immobilization for potential offenders'
- 'Step 2: The psychological deterrent effect of knowing one''s vehicle will be rendered
  inoperable for an extended period reduces perceived benefits of drunk driving'
- 'Step 3: This general deterrence effect operates prior to any DUI conviction, influencing
  decision-making about drinking and driving among the general population'
- 'Step 4: Reduced frequency of alcohol-impaired driving attempts across the population'
