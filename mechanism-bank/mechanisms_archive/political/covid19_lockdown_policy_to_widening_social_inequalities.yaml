- 'Step 1: Lockdown policies mandate business closures, social distancing, and stay-at-home
  orders to reduce COVID-19 transmission'
- 'Step 2: Policy impacts differ by pre-existing socioeconomic position and childhood
  adversity history, with those in precarious employment and with ACE histories experiencing
  greater employment disruption'
- 'Step 3: Differential employment and financial impacts occur without adequate compensatory
  social supports, concentrating economic harms among already disadvantaged populations'
- 'Step 4: Pre-existing inequalities in economic security, health, and social capital
  widen as vulnerable populations experience compounding adversities'
