  node_name: Population Awareness of Alcohol Health Risks
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy mandates placement of health warning labels on alcohol containers,
  creating universal exposure at point of purchase and consumption'
- 'Step 2: Labels provide consistent health messaging about risks (including pregnancy
  risks) directly to consumers in retail and consumption contexts'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to standardized warning messages increases knowledge
  and awareness of specific health risks associated with alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced awareness creates foundation for informed decision-making about
  alcohol use, particularly among populations at risk'
