mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: EARS system contains timely and complete crash data for reported variables'
- 'Step 2: Timely data availability enables rapid identification of crash patterns
  and trends'
- 'Step 3: Quick pattern recognition allows public health and traffic safety officials
  to respond with interventions'
- 'Step 4: However, effectiveness is limited by missing toxicology data fields that
  would identify drug impairment as causal factor'
