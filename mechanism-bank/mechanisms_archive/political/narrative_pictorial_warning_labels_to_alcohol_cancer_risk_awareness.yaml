  individuals to construct coherent stories about alcohol-related health risks'
- 'Step 2: The narrative structure evokes curiosity, imagination, and sympathy while
  avoiding aversion responses that can occur with graphic non-narrative warnings'

  increases cognitive processing and retention of risk information'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced processing and emotional connection lead to increased perception
  of alcohol-related cancer risks among consumers'
