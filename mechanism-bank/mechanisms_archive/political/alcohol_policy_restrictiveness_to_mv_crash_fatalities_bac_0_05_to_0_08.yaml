direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restrictive state alcohol policies reduce overall alcohol consumption and
  alcohol-impaired driving across all BAC levels through reduced availability'
- 'Step 2: Lower rates of alcohol consumption reduce the prevalence of driving in
  the intermediate BAC range (0.05-0.08%) where impairment is present but driving
  remains technically legal'
- 'Step 3: Reduced prevalence of driving at this intermediate BAC range decreases
  crashes in this legally-gray zone'
- 'Step 4: Fewer crashes at BAC 0.05-0.08% result in reduced motor vehicle crash fatalities
  at these sub-legal but impairing BAC levels'
