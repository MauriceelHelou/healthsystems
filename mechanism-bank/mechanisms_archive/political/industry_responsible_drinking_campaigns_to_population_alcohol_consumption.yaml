direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry funds organizations to deliver ''responsible drinking''
  campaigns that emphasize individual responsibility rather than structural interventions'
- 'Step 2: Campaign content and delivery serve industry commercial interests by avoiding
  messages that might reduce overall consumption'
- 'Step 3: Public health resources and political attention are diverted from evidence-based
  population-level policies (e.g., pricing, availability restrictions)'
- 'Step 4: Individual-focused messaging fails to address structural drivers of alcohol
  harm while legitimizing industry as stakeholder in health policy'
- 'Step 5: Absence of effective structural policies maintains or increases population
  alcohol consumption and associated health harms'
