direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Federal agencies (SAMHSA, DEA, HHS) issue guidance allowing audio-only
  telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without in-person evaluation or
  video interface'
- 'Step 2: Removal of in-person and video requirements eliminates technology and transportation
  barriers for people with substance use disorders'
- 'Step 3: Providers can establish phone-based services (tele-bridge clinics) to reach
  previously underserved populations'
- 'Step 4: People with moderate to severe opioid use disorder gain immediate access
  to initial assessment and buprenorphine prescriptions via phone hotlines'
