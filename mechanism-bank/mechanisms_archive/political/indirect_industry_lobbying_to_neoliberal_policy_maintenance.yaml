direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Risk industries fund and deploy SAPROs to perform indirect lobbying functions
  that appear independent from direct industry interests'
- 'Step 2: SAPROs advance policy positions aligned with neoliberal governance (minimal
  regulation, market solutions, individual responsibility)'
- 'Step 3: Indirect lobbying provides political cover for policymakers to resist health-protective
  regulations while appearing responsive to ''civil society'' concerns'
- 'Step 4: Neoliberal policy frameworks persist, creating structural conditions that
  prioritize market freedom over population health protection'
