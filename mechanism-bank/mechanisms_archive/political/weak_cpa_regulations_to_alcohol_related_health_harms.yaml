direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate laws and controls governing industry-government relationships
  allow corporate political activity to operate with minimal oversight'
- 'Step 2: Industry uses political donations, revolving door employment, and hosted
  events to influence policy without sufficient restrictions'
- 'Step 3: Resulting policies fail to implement evidence-based alcohol controls (pricing,
  availability restrictions, marketing limits)'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol availability, marketing exposure, and affordability lead
  to higher consumption and related health harms in population'
