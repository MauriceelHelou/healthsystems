mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: National maximum trading hours policy restricts late-night alcohol availability
  by eliminating 24-hour licenses and setting closing times (4 a.m. for on-license,
  11 p.m. for off-license venues)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability during high-risk hours (late night/early morning)
  decreases population-level alcohol consumption during these periods'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption reduces intoxication levels and alcohol-related
  disinhibition in the population during late-night hours'
- 'Step 4: Decreased intoxication reduces both perpetration of and vulnerability to
  assault, particularly during weekend nights when social drinking is concentrated'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in assault incidents translates to fewer severe injuries requiring
  hospitalization'

  description: Effect was strongest among 15-29-year-olds (IRR=0.82, 95% CI=0.76-0.89),
    suggesting young adults are particularly responsive to restrictions on late-night
    alcohol availability, likely due to higher baseline rates of late-night drinking
    and assault involvement
