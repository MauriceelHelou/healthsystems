direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical policies including redlining, restrictive covenants, and discriminatory
  lending practices force minoritized communities into specific geographic areas'
- 'Step 2: These areas are systematically located near highways, industrial zones,
  and other pollution sources due to exclusionary zoning and discriminatory urban
  planning'
- 'Step 3: Lack of political power and resources in these communities prevents them
  from blocking polluting facilities or advocating for environmental protections'
- 'Step 4: Modern-day disparities in NO2 and PM2.5 distribution reflect these historical
  and ongoing structural inequities'
- 'Step 5: Disparities widen over time (2010-2019) as structural inequities persist
  despite overall pollution reductions'
