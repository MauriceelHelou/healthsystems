- 'Step 1: RBS training provides alcohol servers with knowledge and skills to identify
  signs of intoxication in patrons'
- 'Step 2: Trained servers develop capacity to intervene and refuse service when patrons
  show signs of intoxication'
- 'Step 3: Licensed establishments implement policies and practices that support server
  refusal of service'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol service to intoxicated patrons decreases opportunities
  for drinking while intoxicated'
