mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: UNOS establishes safety net policy with set criteria for offering kidney
  transplantation to patients who developed end-stage renal disease 60-365 days after
  liver transplant'
- 'Step 2: Policy creates priority allocation pathway for kidney transplant recipients
  who experienced acute kidney injury requiring dialysis within 60 days before or
  after liver transplant'
- 'Step 3: Standardized criteria reduce waiting time through preferential organ allocation
  to safety net eligible candidates'
- 'Step 4: Median waiting time decreases from 2827 days to 324 days after policy implementation'
