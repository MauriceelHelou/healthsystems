mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry frames alcohol-related harms as issues of individual responsibility
  rather than marketing exposure'
- 'Step 2: Individual responsibility narrative shifts policy discourse away from environmental
  and structural interventions'
- 'Step 3: Policy makers adopt individual-focused approaches (education, treatment)
  rather than population-level marketing restrictions'
- 'Step 4: Structural determinants of alcohol harm (marketing exposure) remain unaddressed
  while ineffective individual-level interventions are implemented'
