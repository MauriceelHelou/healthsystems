mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal criminalization creates deterrent framework reducing drunk driving
  behavior through enforcement'
- 'Step 2: Reduced drunk driving leads to fewer severe motor vehicle crashes'
- 'Step 3: Fewer crashes result in reduced premature mortality from road traffic deaths'
- 'Step 4: Decreased premature mortality among younger populations yields substantial
  reductions in years of life lost at population level'

  description: The reduction in years of life lost was especially significant among
    males, who likely experience higher baseline mortality from road traffic deaths

    old, where premature deaths create larger YLL burden due to longer remaining life
