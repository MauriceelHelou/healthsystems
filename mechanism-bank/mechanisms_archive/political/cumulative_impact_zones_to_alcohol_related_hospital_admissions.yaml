direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local authorities designate cumulative impact zones in areas with high
  concentrations of alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 2: These zones create spatial restrictions on new alcohol licensing applications,
  preventing further increases in outlet density'
- 'Step 3: Geographic concentration of alcohol availability is reduced or prevented
  from increasing in targeted areas'
- 'Step 4: Population exposure to alcohol retail environments is decreased, particularly
  in areas with existing high outlet density'
- 'Step 5: Reduced outlet density leads to decreased alcohol consumption and associated
  health harms requiring hospitalization'

  strength: moderate
  description: Cumulative impact zones are typically implemented in areas with already
    high outlet density, meaning effects may be stronger in these targeted geographic
    areas

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The effect of cumulative impact zones depends on concurrent enforcement
    activities including license denials and compliance monitoring
