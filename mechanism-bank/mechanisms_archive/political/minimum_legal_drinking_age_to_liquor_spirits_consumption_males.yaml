mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Raising minimum legal drinking age from 16 to 18 creates legal barriers
  specifically affecting purchase of spirits and mixed drinks in commercial settings'
- 'Step 2: Male adolescents may have stronger preferences for liquor and mixed drinks
  consumption in social settings that require legal purchase'
- 'Step 3: Legal restrictions reduce access to bars, clubs, and retail outlets where
  spirits are primarily obtained'
- 'Step 4: Reduced commercial access results in substantial decrease in liquor and
  mixed drinks consumption among males aged 16-18'
