direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current CM review literature and surveillance systems do not examine particular
  forms of CM such as parental overprotection'
- 'Step 2: Absence of parental overprotection from standardized definitions means
  these cases are not captured in epidemiological studies'
- 'Step 3: Child protection systems lack training and protocols to identify and respond
  to psychological maltreatment through overprotection'
- 'Step 4: Children experiencing this form of maltreatment remain invisible to support
  systems, leading to unmet mental health and developmental needs'

    be even less likely to be recognized as potentially harmful

  description: Overprotection may be more readily identified in higher SES contexts
    where developmental autonomy is emphasized, potentially masking its occurrence
    across all social strata
