direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Police agencies deploy saturation patrols (increased officer presence in
  targeted areas/times) focused on detecting impaired drivers'
- 'Step 2: Heightened enforcement visibility creates general deterrent effect on potential
  impaired drivers across broader geographic area'
- 'Step 3: Increased likelihood of detection reduces decision to drive while impaired'
- 'Step 4: In rural areas with limited alternative transportation, deterrence effect
  extends across 10-mile radius catchment area'
- 'Step 5: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving results in fewer fatal traffic crashes'
