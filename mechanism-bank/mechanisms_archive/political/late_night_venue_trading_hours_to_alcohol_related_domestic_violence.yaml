  node_name: Alcohol-Related Domestic Violence
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended late-night trading hours (beyond 3:30 a.m.) allow prolonged alcohol
  consumption during hours associated with highest intoxication levels'
- 'Step 2: Later closing times result in patrons returning home in early morning hours
  with peak blood alcohol concentrations and sleep deprivation'
- 'Step 3: High intoxication combined with fatigue and disrupted circadian rhythms
  increases physiological stress and reduces cognitive control'
- 'Step 4: Impaired judgment and increased aggression associated with severe intoxication
  and fatigue elevate risk of domestic violence incidents'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Having a clearly defined cessation time (e.g., 3:30 a.m.) rather than
    unrestricted trading appears to be a critical moderator of policy effectiveness
- name: temporal_timing_of_violence
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: The paper notes measurements included timing of reported domestic violence
    assaults, suggesting that violence occurring during or immediately after late-night
    hours may be most affected by trading hour restrictions
