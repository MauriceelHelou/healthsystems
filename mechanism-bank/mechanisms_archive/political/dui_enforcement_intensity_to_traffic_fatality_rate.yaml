mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intensified DUI enforcement policies and social control mechanisms implemented
  over 30-year period (1985-2015)'
- 'Step 2: Increased detection, arrest, and prosecution of impaired drivers creates
  deterrent effect and removes intoxicated drivers from roads'
- 'Step 3: After stagnation in first decade of 2000s, renewed decline in DUI rates
  across all sex-by-age groups according to self-reports and traffic fatality data'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving translates to decreased
  alcohol-related traffic fatalities'
