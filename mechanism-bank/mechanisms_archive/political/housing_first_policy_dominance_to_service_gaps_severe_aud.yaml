direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy environments become dominated by a single ''silver bullet'' approach
  (Housing First) to addressing homelessness'
- 'Step 2: Funding, resources, and policy attention concentrate on programs that align
  with all Housing First core principles'
- 'Step 3: Programs that deviate from HF principles (like MAPs) become obscured or
  de-prioritized despite meeting critical needs'
- 'Step 4: Populations who do not fit well with standard HF models fall through service
  gaps, lacking access to appropriate housing and support'
