direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Safety net policy establishes preferential allocation for kidney transplants
  to eligible liver recipients with kidney failure'
- 'Step 2: Policy creates systematic pathway reducing barriers to transplantation
  for clinically appropriate candidates'
- 'Step 3: Increased priority in allocation system leads to more rapid matching and
  transplantation'
- 'Step 4: Kidney transplant rate increases from 30.7 to 87.7 per 100 patient-years
  at risk after policy implementation'
