- 'Step 1: Policy establishes evidence-based design standards including large size,
  text-image combination, and specific health messaging'
- 'Step 2: Standardized design elements ensure labels are visible, attention-grabbing,
  and comprehensible across diverse populations'
- 'Step 3: Consistent implementation creates equitable information environment where
  health warnings reach all consumers regardless of individual information-seeking
  capacity'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced accessibility reduces health literacy barriers and information
  inequities that disproportionately affect marginalized populations'
