direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of zero BAC requirements for drivers under 22 years old
  establishes absolute prohibition on alcohol consumption before driving for this
  age group'
- 'Step 2: Zero tolerance policy increases perceived certainty and severity of legal
  consequences specifically for young drivers'
- 'Step 3: General deterrence effect reduces drinking and driving behavior among young
  driver population'
- 'Step 4: Reduced drinking and driving behavior manifests as fewer drinking and driving
  sanctions received by young drivers relative to non-young drivers'

  strength: strong
  description: Policy specifically targets young drivers (under 22 years old), a previously
    untargeted demographic group. The paper indicates that targeting previously untargeted
    groups enhances deterrence effectiveness.
- name: zero_tolerance_threshold
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Zero BAC requirement provides clear, unambiguous threshold compared
    to numeric BAC limits, potentially enhancing compliance through simplicity and
    perceived certainty of enforcement
