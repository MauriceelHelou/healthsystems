mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative reduction in legal BAC limits from 0.1% to 0.08% for impaired
  driving and 0.05% to 0.03% for driving under influence establishes stricter legal
  standards'
- 'Step 2: Lower legal threshold increases enforcement and penalties for alcohol-impaired
  driving behavior'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced legal deterrence reduces frequency and severity of alcohol-impaired
  driving incidents'
- 'Step 4: Decreased alcohol-impaired driving leads to reduction in traffic collisions
  resulting in injuries'

  description: When accounting for linear time trends, the effect size increased from
    10.5% to 24.8%, suggesting the law's true impact on injuries was stronger than
    crude estimates and counteracted any adverse secular trends
