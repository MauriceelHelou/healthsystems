direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State governments adopt policies mandating alcohol-sensing ignition interlock
  devices for drunk driving offenders'
- 'Step 2: Technology creates physical barrier preventing vehicle operation when driver
  exceeds BAC threshold'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving events lead to fewer fatal crashes'
- 'Step 4: Prevented fatal crashes translate directly to prevented mortality from
  this major cause of preventable death'
