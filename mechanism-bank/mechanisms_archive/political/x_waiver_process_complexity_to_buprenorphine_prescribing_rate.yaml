mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Complex X-waiver regulatory requirements under Drug Addiction Treatment
  Act of 2000 create administrative burden for clinicians'
- 'Step 2: Administrative complexity deters clinicians from completing waiver process
  after training (only 48% obtained waiver)'
- 'Step 3: Among waivered clinicians, perceived complexity continues to impede actual
  prescribing behavior'
- 'Step 4: Reduced clinician participation limits geographic availability and patient
  access to evidence-based opioid use disorder treatment'
