mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Licensing policies requiring multiple visual function tests create screening
  systems that identify drivers with visual impairments'
- 'Step 2: Comprehensive testing (visual acuity, visual field, and additional assessments)
  increases detection of vision-related driving risks beyond single-measure screening'
- 'Step 3: Restriction or remediation of licenses for visually impaired drivers reduces
  on-road exposure of drivers with compromised visual capacity'
- 'Step 4: Lower prevalence of vision-impaired drivers decreases collision rates and
  traffic-related fatalities'
