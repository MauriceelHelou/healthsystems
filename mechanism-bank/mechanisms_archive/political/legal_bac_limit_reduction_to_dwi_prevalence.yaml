direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lowered legal BAC threshold intensifies enforcement and penalties for impaired
  driving'
- 'Step 2: Heightened awareness of legal consequences influences driver decision-making
  about alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption among drivers who
  previously drove at higher BAC levels'
- 'Step 4: Decreased proportion of drivers with severe intoxication (BAC ≥0.05) involved
  in traffic crashes requiring hospitalization'
