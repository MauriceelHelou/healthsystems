direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Annual uprating of alcohol excise duties occurs in April, creating predictable
  price increases'
- 'Step 2: Price increases following tax uprating reduce immediate affordability of
  alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol affordability in April leads to temporal decreases in alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Lower consumption during and following April reduces population-level intoxication
  and violence risk'
- 'Step 5: Violence-related injury rates decline following the April tax uprating,
  creating a measurable ''April effect'' in emergency department attendance data'
