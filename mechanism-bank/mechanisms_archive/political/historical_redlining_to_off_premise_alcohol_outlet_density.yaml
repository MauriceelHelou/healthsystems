direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical redlining policies designated neighborhoods with residents of
  color as ''hazardous'' for investment, leading to systematic disinvestment and property
  devaluation'
- 'Step 2: Disinvestment reduced property values and created economic conditions favoring
  high-turnover, low-capital businesses like liquor stores'
- 'Step 3: Weaker political power in redlined communities resulted in less effective
  opposition to alcohol outlet licensing'
- 'Step 4: State alcohol licensing policies permitted concentrated outlet density
  in areas already experiencing structural disadvantage from redlining'
