- 'Step 1: Federal Medicaid requires states to provide non-emergency medical transportation
  (NEMT) to beneficiaries'
- 'Step 2: State NEMT programs provide rides via public transit passes, taxi vouchers,
  van services, or mileage reimbursement'
- 'Step 3: Transportation assistance removes physical barrier to healthcare appointments
  for eligible beneficiaries'
- 'Step 4: Improved appointment attendance enables preventive care, chronic disease
  management, and medication access'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced healthcare access improves health outcomes and reduces costly
  emergency care reliance'

  interpretation: Medicaid NEMT policy improves healthcare access; policy restrictions
    reduce primary care utilization by 16%. Cost-benefit analysis shows NEMT returns
    $2.40 in avoided costs per dollar spent.

description: Medicaid non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) is a federally mandated
  benefit that improves healthcare access for low-income beneficiaries facing transportation
  barriers. Evidence shows restricting NEMT leads to 16% decline in primary care visits,
  while cost-benefit analysis finds NEMT returns $2.40 in avoided healthcare costs
  for every dollar invested. NEMT addresses structural transportation barriers that
  otherwise prevent healthcare utilization among Medicaid populations.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: policy
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: NEMT is a structural policy intervention that addresses transportation
    barriers created by urban planning, transit disinvestment, and healthcare facility
    siting decisions that disadvantage low-income communities. Expanding and improving
    NEMT programs, including integration with rideshare services, is a policy lever
    to reduce transportation-based healthcare disparities.
assumptions:
- NEMT benefit covers transportation to Medicaid-covered healthcare services
- Program modalities include public transit, taxi, van, rideshare, mileage reimbursement
- Effect operates through removing transportation barriers to appointment attendance
limitations:
- NEMT program quality varies substantially across states
- Administrative barriers may limit effective use of benefit
- Studies of policy restrictions provide stronger causal evidence than observational
  studies
- Limited research on newer rideshare-based NEMT models
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: NEMT program design, quality, and utilization vary substantially
    by state and urban/rural geography.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas face greater transportation barriers but may have limited NEMT options
  - Urban areas have more NEMT options but still face barriers for those with disabilities
  - States with better-funded NEMT programs show improved healthcare access
