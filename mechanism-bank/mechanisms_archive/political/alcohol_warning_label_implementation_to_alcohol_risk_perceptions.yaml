mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regulatory policy requires alcohol warning labels providing health risk
  information on products'
- 'Step 2: Consumers encounter warning messages during purchase and consumption contexts'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to risk messages increases perceived severity and likelihood
  of alcohol-related harms'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced risk perceptions create cognitive basis for protective behavioral
  change'
