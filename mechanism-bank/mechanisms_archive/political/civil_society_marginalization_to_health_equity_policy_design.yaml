direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government partnerships with industry-funded organizations legitimize industry
  stakeholders in health policy processes'
- 'Step 2: Limited policy development resources and political attention are allocated
  to industry partners rather than independent civil society organizations'
- 'Step 3: Independent public health voices, community organizations, and advocacy
  groups are excluded or minimized in policy deliberations'
- 'Step 4: Policy design reflects industry preferences for individual-focused interventions
  rather than structural changes that address root causes and health inequities'
- 'Step 5: Resulting policies fail to address differential exposures and vulnerabilities
  experienced by marginalized populations, perpetuating health inequities'
