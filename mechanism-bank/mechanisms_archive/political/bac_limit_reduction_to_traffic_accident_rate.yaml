mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal BAC limit is reduced from 0.8 to 0.5 mg/100ml through policy change
  in Scotland'
- 'Step 2: The policy change is expected to deter drinking and driving behavior through
  legal consequences'
- 'Step 3: Reduced drinking and driving would theoretically decrease impaired driving
  incidents'
- 'Step 4: However, the study finds no measurable impact on traffic accident rates,
  suggesting the mechanism did not operate as expected'
