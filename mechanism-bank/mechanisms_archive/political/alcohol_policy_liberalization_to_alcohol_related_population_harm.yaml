direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry-influenced policy liberalization reduces restrictions on alcohol
  availability, marketing, and sales'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol availability through expanded retail access and reduced
  price controls'
- 'Step 3: Population-level alcohol consumption increases due to greater physical
  and economic accessibility'
- 'Step 4: Higher consumption rates lead to increased incidence of alcohol-related
  health conditions (liver disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease), injuries, violence,
  and social harms'
- 'Step 5: Public health protections are limited by industry-shaped policies, reducing
  capacity to prevent alcohol-related harms'
