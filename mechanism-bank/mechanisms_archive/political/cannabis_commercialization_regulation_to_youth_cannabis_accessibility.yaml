mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regulatory frameworks governing cannabis commercialization determine age
  restrictions, retail location constraints, and marketing limitations'
- 'Step 2: Strong regulations create structural barriers to youth access through enforcement
  of age verification, limits on retail density near schools, and restrictions on
  youth-appealing marketing'
- 'Step 3: Reduced accessibility limits youth exposure opportunities during critical
  neurodevelopmental periods'
- 'Step 4: Lower exposure rates protect adolescent brain development from cannabis-induced
  neurocognitive impacts'
