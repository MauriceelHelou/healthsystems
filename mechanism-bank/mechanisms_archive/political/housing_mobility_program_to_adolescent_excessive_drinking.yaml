- 'Step 1: Housing voucher policy enables families to leave concentrated poverty in
  public housing and relocate to different neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Relocation changes exposure to neighborhood built environment features
  including alcohol outlet density and configuration'
- 'Step 3: Changes in alcohol retail environment alter structural availability and
  accessibility of alcohol to adolescents'
- 'Step 4: Modified alcohol environment mediates effects on adolescent drinking behaviors,
  with gender-specific pathways'

  description: MTO decreased girls' alcohol use but increased boys' alcohol use, representing
    opposite directional effects by gender that may operate through different social
    and environmental pathways
- name: voucher_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Treatment groups were pooled (low-poverty voucher and any-neighborhood
    voucher) as they were conceptually and statistically similar on primary outcome;
    both involved housing mobility compared to public housing control
- name: neighborhood_outlet_density
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Treatment benefits for girls were 18% greater in high outlet density
    neighborhoods, suggesting outlet density moderates housing mobility effects
