direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry actors (producers, retailers, trade associations, licensees,
  advertising companies) gain formal access to policy consultation processes'
- 'Step 2: Industry submissions introduce commercial interests and profit motivations
  into public health decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Industry lobbying creates political pressure to adopt weaker regulations
  or industry-preferred alternatives'
- 'Step 4: Final policies are diluted, delayed, or incorporate industry-friendly exemptions'
- 'Step 5: Resulting regulations lack sufficient strength to achieve population health
  benefits'
