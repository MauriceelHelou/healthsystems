- 'Step 1: Extended trading hours (temporal aspects) increase time periods during
  which alcohol can be purchased'
- 'Step 2: Late night availability creates opportunities for extended drinking sessions
  and night-time economy activities'
- 'Step 3: Temporal accessibility contributes to social normalization of drinking
  during extended hours'
- 'Step 4: Combined temporal and spatial availability creates more permissive drinking
  environments'
