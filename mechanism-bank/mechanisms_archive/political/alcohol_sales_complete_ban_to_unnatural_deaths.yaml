direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Complete ban on alcohol sales disrupts the alcohol supply chain and eliminates
  legal access to alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability decreases population-level alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption reduces risky behaviors and violence associated
  with intoxication'
- 'Step 4: Decreased alcohol-related violence and accidents result in fewer unnatural
  deaths (homicides, accidents, injuries)'

  description: The reduction in unnatural deaths from complete alcohol bans was statistically
    significant regardless of curfew length, suggesting the alcohol ban effect is
    independent of curfew duration
