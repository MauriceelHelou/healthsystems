direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MLDA laws create legal barriers to alcohol access for individuals below
  the specified age threshold'
- 'Step 2: Legal restrictions have minimal impact on drinking patterns among young
  women, who show less extreme drinking at baseline'
- 'Step 3: Limited behavioral change results in minimal reduction in alcohol-related
  harms among young women'
- 'Step 4: Small or negligible effects on mortality rates among young female populations'

  description: Being female substantially weakens the protective effect of MLDA on
    mortality, indicating that the policy mechanism operates differently or less effectively
    for young women compared to young men
