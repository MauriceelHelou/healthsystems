mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative reduction in legal BAC limits from 0.1% to 0.08% for impaired
  driving and 0.05% to 0.03% for driving under influence creates stricter legal threshold'
- 'Step 2: Lower legal threshold increases enforcement capacity and legal consequences
  for alcohol-impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced deterrence effect reduces prevalence of driving with elevated
  blood alcohol levels'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in alcohol-impaired driving decreases fatal traffic collisions'

  description: When accounting for linear time trends, the effect size decreased from
    28.1% to 20.9%, suggesting some of the observed reduction may be attributable
    to secular trends rather than law alone
