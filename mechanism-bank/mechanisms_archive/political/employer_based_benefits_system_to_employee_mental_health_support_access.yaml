- 'Step 1: U.S. health benefits system ties access to employer-provided benefits,
  with differential thresholds based on employer size (e.g., ACA defines small business
  as 1-50 employees)'
- 'Step 2: Small Business Association and federal programs define small businesses
  variably (from under 100 to over 1000 employees), creating complex regulatory landscape'
- 'Step 3: Smallest employers face regulatory and economic barriers to providing comprehensive
  benefits like Employee Assistance Programs'
- 'Step 4: Workers at small employers (52% of private sector) have structurally reduced
  access to workplace mental health resources compared to large employer workers'
