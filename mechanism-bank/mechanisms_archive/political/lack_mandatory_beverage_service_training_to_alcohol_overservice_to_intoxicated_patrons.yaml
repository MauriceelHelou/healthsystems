direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of mandatory training requirements means servers lack standardized
  education on identifying intoxication and legal obligations'
- 'Step 2: Untrained servers fail to recognize obvious signs of intoxication or are
  unaware of legal prohibitions against overservice'
- 'Step 3: Establishments lack organizational policies and cultures prioritizing service
  refusal to intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 4: Servers continue providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated patrons at
  high rates (79% overservice observed)'
