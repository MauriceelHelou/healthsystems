direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal BAC limit of 0.5 g/L establishes threshold at which driving is permitted
  despite measurable impairment'
- 'Step 2: At this threshold, drivers experience clinically significant road tracking
  impairment (2.5 cm increase in SDLP, exceeding 2.4 cm clinical relevance criterion)'
- 'Step 3: Increased weaving behavior at legal BAC limit reduces safety margins and
  increases probability of lane departures, near-misses, and collisions'
- 'Step 4: Population-level exposure to legally-permitted impaired driving creates
  sustained elevated crash risk'
