direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social restrictions including closure
  of bars, cancellation of social events, restrictions on gatherings, and campus closures'
- 'Step 2: These restrictions reduced access to typical college drinking contexts
  and social environments where alcohol use normally occurs'
- 'Step 3: Reduced opportunities for social drinking led to actual decreases in alcohol
  use frequency, quantity, and heavy episodic drinking among most college students'
- 'Step 4: Simultaneously, students perceived that their peers were also decreasing
  alcohol use, reinforcing downward normative shifts that further supported reduced
  drinking behavior'
