direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP sets a floor price per unit of pure alcohol (e.g., Int$ 0.90/10g),
  preventing sale below this threshold'
- 'Step 2: MUP disproportionately affects cheap, high-strength alcohol products by
  raising their minimum price'
- 'Step 3: Consumers of low-cost, high-volume alcohol face largest price increases
  and reduced affordability'
- 'Step 4: Price increases reduce purchasing and consumption, particularly among price-sensitive
  heavy drinkers who favor cheap alcohol'
