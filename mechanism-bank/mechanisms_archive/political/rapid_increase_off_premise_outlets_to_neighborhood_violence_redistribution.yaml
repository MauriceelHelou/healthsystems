direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy changes permit rapid proliferation of off-premise alcohol outlets
  in a short time period'
- 'Step 2: Large increases in outlet density alter the spatial distribution of alcohol
  availability across neighborhoods'
- 'Step 3: Neighborhoods adjacent to areas with concentrated new outlets experience
  increased alcohol-related activity and consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Violence risk redistributes geographically, with no net city-wide increase
  but localized increases in areas adjacent to outlet clusters'
