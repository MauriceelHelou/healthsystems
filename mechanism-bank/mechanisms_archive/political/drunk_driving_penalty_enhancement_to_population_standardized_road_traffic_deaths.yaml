direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased penalties for drunk driving create stronger economic and social
  disincentives for impaired driving behavior'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced enforcement combined with stricter penalties increases perceived
  risk of consequences among potential drunk drivers'
- 'Step 3: Deterrent effect reduces population-level prevalence of drunk driving incidents
  independent of population growth'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of alcohol-impaired driving per capita result in decreased
  population-standardized road traffic mortality rates'

moderators:
- name: motor_vehicle_density
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: The steady upward trend in motor vehicles during the study period increased
    baseline exposure risk, yet standardized mortality still declined, suggesting
    policy effects persisted despite increased traffic density
- name: enforcement_consistency
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The sustained reduction over 7.7 years suggests consistent enforcement
    of enhanced penalties maintained the deterrent effect throughout the study period
