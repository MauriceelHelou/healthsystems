direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Weak alcohol control policies (pricing, availability, marketing regulations)
  create high baseline population alcohol consumption over time'
- 'Step 2: High baseline consumption results in larger population with alcohol use
  disorders and heavy drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: During pandemic crisis, this larger vulnerable population experiences intensified
  drinking due to stress and isolation'
- 'Step 4: Greater number of people with severe alcohol use patterns leads to higher
  absolute increases in alcohol-attributable mortality during crisis'

  description: More comprehensive alcohol control policies (pricing, availability,
    marketing restrictions) reduce baseline consumption and therefore reduce vulnerable
    population size and crisis-related mortality increases
- name: policy_enforcement_duration
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Longer duration of effective alcohol control policies provides more
    time to reduce population heavy drinking prevalence, creating greater resilience
    to crisis impacts
