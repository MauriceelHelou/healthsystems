direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excise tax levels determine final alcohol prices in retail markets, affecting
  economic accessibility'
- 'Step 2: Lower excise taxation (insufficient relative to health costs) maintains
  alcohol affordability across socioeconomic strata'
- 'Step 3: Higher affordability reduces economic barriers to alcohol purchase and
  consumption at population level'
- 'Step 4: Increased population-level consumption generates alcohol-attributable disease
  burden across multiple cause categories measured through GBD methodology'
- 'Step 5: Disease burden manifests as disability-adjusted life-years with substantial
  societal value loss (6.2 trillion INR)'
