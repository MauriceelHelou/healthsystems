direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restrictive late-night alcohol policies limit venue entry times (after
  1:00-1:30 a.m.) and cease trading at 3:30 a.m., reducing overall hours of alcohol
  availability'
- 'Step 2: Reduced trading hours and entry restrictions modify the drinking environment,
  decreasing opportunities for excessive alcohol consumption during peak late-night
  hours'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption during late-night hours reduces intoxication
  levels among patrons returning to domestic settings'
- 'Step 4: Reduced intoxication levels decrease the likelihood of alcohol-fueled domestic
  violence incidents in the home'

  description: Newcastle had more comprehensive restrictions (1:30 a.m. entry cutoff,
    3:30 a.m. closure, plus other alcohol service restrictions) and showed more robust
    effects compared to Hamilton (1:00 a.m. entry cutoff with alcohol service restrictions
    but no explicit closing time mentioned)

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effectiveness varied between two intervention sites despite similar
    policy approaches, suggesting local context factors (enforcement, compliance,
    local drinking culture) moderate the policy impact
