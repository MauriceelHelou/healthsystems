mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Enforcement of 0.08 g/dL BAC legal limits establishes clear legal threshold
  and consequences for impaired driving'
- 'Step 2: Consistent enforcement creates deterrence through increased certainty of
  legal sanctions for exceeding BAC threshold'
- 'Step 3: Legal standard provides objective basis for arrest and prosecution, reducing
  impaired drivers on roadways'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prevalence of impaired drivers decreases crash risk and associated
  fatalities'
