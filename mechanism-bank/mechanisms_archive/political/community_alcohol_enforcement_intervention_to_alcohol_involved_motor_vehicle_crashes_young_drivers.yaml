direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Enhanced enforcement operations (DUI checkpoints, saturation patrols, undercover
  bar operations) increase perceived risk of detection for alcohol-impaired driving'
- 'Step 2: High visibility component ensures public awareness of enforcement activities,
  creating general deterrence effect in community'
- 'Step 3: Reduced service of alcohol to intoxicated patrons in bars decreases opportunities
  for excessive alcohol consumption before driving'
- 'Step 4: Combined enforcement strategies create normative shift reducing alcohol-impaired
  driving behavior among adolescents and young adults'
- 'Step 5: Decreased alcohol-impaired driving directly reduces single vehicle nighttime
  crashes among targeted age group'

moderators:
- name: intervention_dosage
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Dosage was found to have a statistically significant effect on crashes,
    although not in the expected direction, suggesting potential implementation challenges
    or threshold effects where excessive enforcement may produce unintended consequences
- name: city_population_size
  direction: strengthens
  strength: weak
  description: Cities were selected with populations between 50,000 and 450,000, suggesting
    intervention may be most applicable to mid-sized urban areas with sufficient infrastructure
    for coordinated enforcement
