mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-quality narrative PWLs with clear character, explicit causal connections
  between alcohol and cancer, and contextual setting provide structural elements for
  story construction'
- 'Step 2: These design features enable viewers to mentally simulate health risk scenarios
  without requiring high cognitive effort or health literacy'
- 'Step 3: The narrative structure elicits sympathy for characters and curiosity about
  outcomes, creating emotional pathways for information processing'
- 'Step 4: Unlike graphic warnings that may cause avoidance, narrative PWLs maintain
  attention and facilitate deeper engagement with risk messaging'
