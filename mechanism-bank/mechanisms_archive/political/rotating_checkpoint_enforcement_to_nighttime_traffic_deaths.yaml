  node_name: Nighttime Traffic Deaths
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rotating sobriety checkpoints create unpredictable enforcement patterns
  across geographic area'
- 'Step 2: Sustained deterrent effect reduces drunk driving across multiple routes
  during the learning period'
- 'Step 3: Reduced drunk driving decreases severity and frequency of nighttime traffic
  collisions'
- 'Step 4: Fewer severe collisions result in lower traffic mortality rates'
