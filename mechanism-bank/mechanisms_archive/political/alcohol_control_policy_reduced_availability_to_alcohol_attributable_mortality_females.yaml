direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol control policies restrict the physical and temporal availability
  of alcohol through regulatory measures'
- 'Step 2: Reduced availability decreases population-level alcohol access and consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption reduces acute and chronic alcohol-related health
  conditions in women'
- 'Step 4: Decreased burden of alcohol-related diseases results in lower fully alcohol-attributable
  mortality among females'
