  node_name: Youth Marketing Exposure
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Voluntary industry self-regulation typically sets weak standards based
  on audience composition thresholds (e.g., allowing advertising in media where youth
  comprise <30% of audience) rather than absolute exposure reduction'
- 'Step 2: Self-regulatory codes often lack enforcement mechanisms and penalties,
  allowing continued youth exposure through non-compliance'
- 'Step 3: Industry self-regulation does not restrict emerging marketing channels
  such as digital media, social media, and experiential marketing where youth exposure
  is high'
- 'Step 4: Weak self-regulatory frameworks permit continued high levels of youth exposure
  to alcohol marketing across multiple channels, maintaining the structural determinant
  of marketing exposure'

    may be slightly more effective due to easier coordination, though still less effective
