- 'Step 1: Pre-trial diversion, drug courts, and treatment alternatives to incarceration identify individuals
  with AUD in criminal justice system'
- 'Step 2: Court mandate or incentive structure (charges dropped/reduced) overcomes individual barriers
  to treatment initiation'
- 'Step 3: Diversion programs connect justice-involved individuals to community-based treatment services
  they otherwise wouldn''t access'
- 'Step 4: Supervision and accountability from court or probation supports treatment engagement and completion'
- 'Step 5: Successful treatment completion reduces recidivism, addresses underlying AUD, and interrupts
  cycle of addiction and justice involvement'

description: Criminal justice diversion programs increase treatment access for individuals with alcohol

  description: Diversion access must be equitable; often white defendants access diversion while defendants

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: policy
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: 'Criminal justice diversion represents partial recognition that addiction is health
    issue, not crime—but operates within fundamentally unjust system. Criminalization of addiction itself
    reflects policy choice to punish rather than treat. Diversion programs show racial inequities with
    white defendants accessing treatment while Black and Latino defendants face incarceration for identical
    behaviors. Drug courts can be coercive, punishing relapse as criminal behavior rather than medical
    symptom. The existence of diversion as "alternative" normalizes criminalization as default. Communities
    of color experience both over-policing that funnels people into system AND under-resourcing of voluntary
    treatment alternatives. Diversion is harm reduction within punitive system but inadequate solution.
    True structural competency requires: decriminalization of addiction, investment in voluntary community
    treatment exceeding diversion capacity, elimination of racial disparities in diversion access, and
    challenging premise that criminal justice system should be gateway to healthcare.'
assumptions:
- Diversion programs include drug courts, pre-trial diversion, and deferred prosecution
- Participation involves both treatment mandate and incentive (charge dismissal)
- Mechanism assumes connection to evidence-based community treatment
limitations:
- Coerced treatment may be less effective than voluntary treatment for some individuals
- Diversion often limited to first-time or non-violent offenders, excluding those with greatest need
- Relapse during diversion can result in incarceration, compounding punishment
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Diversion program availability and quality varies dramatically by jurisdiction, with
    systematic racial and geographic inequities
  relevant_geographies:
  - Urban areas more likely to have drug courts and diversion programs than rural jurisdictions
  - States vary widely in diversion availability and eligibility criteria
  - Affluent counties offer more robust diversion options than under-resourced jurisdictions
  - Racial disparities in diversion access documented across jurisdictions with white defendants preferentially
    diverted
