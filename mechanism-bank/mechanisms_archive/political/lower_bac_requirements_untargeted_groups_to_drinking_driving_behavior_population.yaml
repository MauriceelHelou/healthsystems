mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of lower BAC requirements (warn-range 0.05-0.08% and zero
  BAC for young drivers) extends legal sanctions to previously untargeted groups and
  behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Expansion of policy coverage closes legal gaps where drinking and driving
  was de facto permissible, creating new normative expectations'
- 'Step 3: General deterrence operates through increased perceived risk of sanctions
  across broader population segments'
- 'Step 4: Population-wide shifts in drinking and driving behavior reduce overall
  incidence and associated collision injuries and deaths'

  strength: strong
  description: The paper concludes that sanctions targeting previously untargeted
    groups are effective as general deterrents. The novelty of extending coverage
    to new groups or BAC ranges enhances deterrence effectiveness.

  strength: moderate
  description: General deterrence requires public awareness of new policies and perceived
    likelihood of enforcement; visible enforcement activities strengthen the deterrent
    effect
