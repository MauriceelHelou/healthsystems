direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Corporate lobbying expenditures create institutional legitimacy and normalize
  industry influence over regulatory processes'
- 'Step 2: Regulators internalize industry perspectives and priorities, reducing independence
  and enforcement rigor'
- 'Step 3: Weakened enforcement allows unsafe products to remain in commerce longer,
  increasing population exposure to safety hazards'
- 'Step 4: Differential access to information, vehicle quality, and legal recourse
  means safety enforcement failures disproportionately harm economically marginalized
  populations through increased injury, disability, and mortality'
