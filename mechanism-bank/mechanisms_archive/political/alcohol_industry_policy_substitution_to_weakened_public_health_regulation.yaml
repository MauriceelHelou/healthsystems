  public health protections during policy reform debates'
- 'Step 2: Industry frames self-regulation as more flexible and business-friendly
  approach to addressing alcohol-related concerns'
- 'Step 3: Policy-makers substitute mandatory regulatory measures with voluntary industry-led
  initiatives'
- 'Step 4: Self-regulatory mechanisms lack enforcement power and accountability structures
  of government regulation'

  and compliance'
