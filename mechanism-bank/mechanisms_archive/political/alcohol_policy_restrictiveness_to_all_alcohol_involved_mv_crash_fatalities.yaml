mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restrictive state alcohol policies comprehensively reduce alcohol availability,
  accessibility, and marketing through multiple simultaneous policy mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability decreases population-level alcohol consumption
  patterns across the entire distribution of drinking behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption reduces the prevalence of alcohol-impaired driving
  at all BAC levels, both above and below legal thresholds'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving across all BAC levels decreases total
  alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes and fatalities'
