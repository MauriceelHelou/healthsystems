direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal access to alcohol at age 16 creates discontinuous increase in alcohol
  availability for youth'
- 'Step 2: Concurrent timing with driving licensure creates interaction between novice
  driving and potential alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Novice driver effect (inexperience with vehicle operation) becomes primary
  driver of mortality risk rather than alcohol access itself'
- 'Step 4: Increased motor vehicle crashes and traffic-related deaths occur at age
  threshold'
