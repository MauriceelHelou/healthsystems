direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of oral fluid (OF) roadside testing provides law enforcement
  with objective, on-site screening tool for marijuana intoxication'
- 'Step 2: OF testing increases detection accuracy compared to subjective officer
  assessment or reliance on blood testing alone'
- 'Step 3: More accurate screening increases true positive identifications of marijuana-impaired
  drivers'
- 'Step 4: Simultaneously decreases false positive arrests based on incorrect suspicions
  of impairment'
