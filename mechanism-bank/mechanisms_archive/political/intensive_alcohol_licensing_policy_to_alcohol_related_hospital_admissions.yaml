direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Local authorities implement intensive licensing policies including cumulative
  impact zones that restrict the density of alcohol outlets in specific geographic
  areas'
- 'Step 2: Licensing enforcement agencies decline new premises licenses, reducing
  the physical availability of alcohol retail locations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol outlet density decreases population-level access to alcohol
  and modifies the drinking environment'
- 'Step 4: Lower alcohol availability and environmental modifications lead to reduced
  alcohol consumption at the population level'
- 'Step 5: Decreased alcohol consumption results in fewer acute and chronic alcohol-related
  health conditions requiring hospitalization'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: An exposure-response relationship was observed where areas with more
    intense licensing policies (high vs medium vs low vs passive) showed progressively
    stronger reductions in alcohol-related hospital admissions, demonstrating a dose-response
    relationship

  strength: moderate
  description: Population deprivation data were controlled for in analyses, suggesting
    the mechanism may operate differently across socioeconomic contexts
