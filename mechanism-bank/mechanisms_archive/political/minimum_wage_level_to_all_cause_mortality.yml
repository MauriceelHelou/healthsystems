- 'Step 1: Higher minimum wages increase income for low-wage workers, reducing poverty and economic deprivation'
- 'Step 2: Increased income improves access to healthcare, nutrition, housing quality, and other health-promoting resources'
- 'Step 3: Reduced chronic financial stress decreases allostatic load and stress-related disease risk'
- 'Step 4: Better material conditions reduce deaths from conditions associated with low socioeconomic status (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke)'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative improvements in health determinants reduce overall mortality rates at the population level'

description: Higher minimum wages are associated with reduced all-cause mortality and increased life expectancy. Analysis of 24 OECD countries found that a 10 percentage point increase in the minimum wage ratio was associated with significant reductions in overall death rates and a 0.44 year increase in life expectancy. Effects were particularly strong for mortality from conditions more prevalent among low-SES individuals (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke). Additional evidence suggests minimum wage increases reduce suicide rates, particularly during periods of high unemployment.

  equity_implications: Mortality disparities by income reflect structural economic conditions. Minimum wage policy is a macro-level intervention that addresses economic determinants of health. Effects on mortality from diabetes and cardiovascular disease highlight how economic policy shapes chronic disease outcomes for low-wage workers.
assumptions:
- Assumes minimum wage affects material conditions of low-wage workers
- Assumes income operates through multiple pathways (healthcare, nutrition, housing, stress)
- Assumes effects are not offset by employment reductions
limitations:
- Cross-country ecological design limits causal inference
- Country-level heterogeneity in labor markets and health systems
- Minimum wage may interact with other social policies
- Effects may take years to manifest in mortality
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Effects vary by baseline minimum wage, healthcare system, and social safety net
  relevant_geographies:
  - US may show larger effects due to weak safety net and employer-sponsored insurance
  - Nordic countries with strong safety nets may show smaller effects
  - Effects likely larger in countries with high inequality
