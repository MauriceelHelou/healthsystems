  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) Among Older Adults
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: US policy environment differs from global context with potentially greater
  alcohol availability, marketing to older adults, and normalization of alcohol use
  in aging'
- 'Step 2: Lack of targeted public health strategies and screening programs for older
  adults allows undetected and untreated problematic alcohol use to persist and worsen'
- 'Step 3: Limited integration of geriatric-focused addiction services and age-appropriate
  interventions results in progression from problematic use to clinical AUD'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers to addiction treatment (cost, access, stigma) prevent
  older adults from receiving evidence-based care'
