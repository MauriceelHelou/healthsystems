direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural violence and oppression based on gender identity, sexual orientation,
  race, and criminal legal status create chronic stress and marginalization'
- 'Step 2: Systematic exclusion from healthcare, employment, housing, and social support
  systems limits protective resources and coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Marginalized populations face microaggressions, discrimination, and violence
  that accumulate as trauma exposure'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to culturally responsive, affirming mental health and substance
  use services leaves needs unaddressed'
- 'Step 5: Substance use emerges as coping mechanism for structural trauma and becomes
  substance use disorder'
