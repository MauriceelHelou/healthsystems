mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cloud-based IoT system automatically transmits real-time data on driver
  alcohol levels and GPS location to law enforcement agencies when impairment is detected'
- 'Step 2: Automated notification eliminates need for manual detection through traffic
  stops or citizen reports, enabling immediate law enforcement awareness'
- 'Step 3: Pre-identified location data allows targeted and efficient dispatch of
  enforcement resources to specific vehicles/locations'
- 'Step 4: Reduced time spent on random patrol and manual detection allows law enforcement
  to allocate resources more efficiently across other public safety priorities'
