  node_name: Consistency of Program Effectiveness Across Diverse Campuses
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Institutional commitment to implementing evidence-based sexual violence
  prevention programming provides structural support for behavior change interventions'
- 'Step 2: Standardized program delivery across diverse campus contexts ensures consistent
  exposure to intervention content regardless of campus characteristics'
- 'Step 3: Program design that addresses universal aspects of campus sexual violence
  (peer norms, bystander behavior) rather than campus-specific factors enables broad
  applicability'
- 'Step 4: Multi-campus feasibility demonstrated, suggesting programs can be scaled
  across different institutional contexts without significant adaptation'
