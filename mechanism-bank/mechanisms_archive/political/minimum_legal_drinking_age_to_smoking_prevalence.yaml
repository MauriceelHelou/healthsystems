mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Raising minimum legal drinking age could theoretically reduce access to
  social environments where both alcohol and tobacco are consumed'

  for tobacco initiation or use'
- 'Step 3: Cross-substance effects could occur if alcohol and tobacco use are complementary
  behaviors in youth social contexts'
