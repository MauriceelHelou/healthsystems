  (MOUD) such as methadone and buprenorphine'
- 'Step 2: Restrictions create barriers including in-person requirements, limited
  prescriber availability, and regulatory constraints'

  addiction treatment'
- 'Step 4: Untreated or undertreated opioid use disorder increases overdose risk and
  mortality'
