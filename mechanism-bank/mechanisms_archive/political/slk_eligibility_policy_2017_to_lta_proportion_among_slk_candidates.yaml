mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stricter SLK eligibility criteria excluded candidates with kidney dysfunction
  from dual-organ listing'
- 'Step 2: Candidates who previously would have qualified for SLK were redirected
  to liver-alone transplant pathway'
- 'Step 3: Transplant centers proceeded with liver-only transplantation for patients
  with renal impairment who no longer met SLK criteria'
- 'Step 4: Proportion of SLK candidates ultimately receiving LTA increased from 3.0%
  to 7.9%'
