direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Text-only warning labels on alcohol products communicate cancer risk information
  to consumers without triggering strong negative emotions'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to text-only warnings raises awareness of alcohol-related cancer
  risks among consumers'
- 'Step 3: Low emotional arousal (minimal anger/disgust) prevents defensive psychological
  reactions or boomerang effects'
- 'Step 4: Consumers form intentions to reduce alcohol consumption based on risk information
  without emotional interference'
