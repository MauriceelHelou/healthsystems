- 'Step 1: Mass incarceration policies remove working-age adults from communities,
  disrupting families and economic networks'
- 'Step 2: Incarceration concentrates in low-income communities of color due to racially
  disparate policing and sentencing'
- 'Step 3: Community-level social capital, family stability, and economic opportunity
  deteriorate in high-incarceration areas'
- 'Step 4: Returning individuals face employment barriers, housing restrictions,
  and healthcare access challenges'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative community effects manifest as elevated chronic disease rates,
  mental health burden, and reduced life expectancy'

  interpretation: Mass incarceration creates population health burden through both
    individual effects on those incarcerated and community-level effects in high-incarceration
    areas. Racial disparities mean Black communities bear disproportionate health
    consequences.

description: Mass incarceration policy creates population health harm through multiple
  pathways including individual health deterioration during and after incarceration,
  family disruption, community economic damage, and concentrated disadvantage in high-incarceration
  areas. With 2.3 million incarcerated daily and 10+ million annual jail admissions,
  and stark racial disparities (32% lifetime risk for Black men vs. 6% for white men),
  mass incarceration is a structural determinant of health inequities.

  equity_implications: Mass incarceration is a policy-driven structural determinant
    of health that disproportionately harms Black and low-income communities. The
    health consequences reflect decades of racially disparate criminal legal policy
    including the war on drugs, mandatory minimums, and aggressive policing in communities
    of color. Addressing mass incarceration health effects requires decarceration,
    criminal legal reform, and addressing root causes of both incarceration and health
    inequity.
assumptions:
- Mass incarceration defined as historically elevated US incarceration rates since
  1970s
- Community health effects operate through multiple pathways beyond individual incarceration
- Racial disparities reflect systemic racism in criminal legal system
limitations:
- Difficult to isolate incarceration effect from correlated disadvantages
- Community-level effects hard to attribute causally
- Most evidence from US context with unique incarceration patterns
- Selection effects challenge causal inference
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Incarceration rates and community health impacts vary substantially
    by state, county, and neighborhood.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Southern states have highest incarceration rates
  - Urban neighborhoods show concentrated incarceration effects
  - States with reform policies show improved trajectories
