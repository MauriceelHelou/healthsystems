mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Advent of continuous, passive, transdermal devices and portable breath-testing
  devices with cameras provides more efficient monitoring infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Advanced technologies enable more reliable and consistent detection of
  alcohol consumption compared to traditional methods'
- 'Step 3: Improved reliability and efficiency of monitoring increases treatment program
  adherence and reduces opportunities for non-compliance'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced monitoring capability improves overall treatment effectiveness
  and reduces DWI recidivism'
