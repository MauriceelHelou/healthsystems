direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry engages in systematic activities to obstruct public health
  policies that might reduce future alcohol sales'
- 'Step 2: Industry tactics include establishing front organizations, funding ''health
  promotion'' campaigns, and cultivating partnerships with government agencies'
- 'Step 3: These activities create organizational conflicts of interest within government
  health departments and constrain policy options'
- 'Step 4: Policy-makers face pressure to manage perceptions and maintain partnerships,
  leading to self-censorship and compromise on evidence-based interventions'
- 'Step 5: Weakened or blocked public health policies result in continued high levels
  of alcohol availability, consumption, and associated population health harms'
