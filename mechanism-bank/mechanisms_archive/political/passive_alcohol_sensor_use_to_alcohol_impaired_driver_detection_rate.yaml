direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Passive alcohol sensors allow officers to detect alcohol presence without
  requiring driver cooperation or probable cause for testing'
- 'Step 2: Improved detection technology increases the proportion of impaired drivers
  identified during routine traffic stops'
- 'Step 3: Higher detection rates lead to more impaired drivers removed from roads
  and increased perceived apprehension risk in the community'
