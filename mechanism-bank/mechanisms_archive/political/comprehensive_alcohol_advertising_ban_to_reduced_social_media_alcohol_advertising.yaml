direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legislative enactment of total prohibition on alcohol advertising creates
  legal framework with enforcement mechanisms and penalties for violations'
- 'Step 2: Policy explicitly includes social media platforms in the advertising ban,
  closing loopholes that allow digital marketing to circumvent traditional media restrictions'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol companies and influencers modify marketing practices to comply
  with legal requirements, discontinuing paid advertising and branded content on social
  media'
- 'Step 4: Population exposure to alcohol marketing on social media platforms is substantially
  reduced, with only minimal violations (1.4% of posts in study represented infractions)'
