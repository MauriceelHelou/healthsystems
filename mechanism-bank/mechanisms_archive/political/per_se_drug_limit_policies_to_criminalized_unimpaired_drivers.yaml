direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Per-se THC limits are established without scientific basis linking specific
  blood THC levels to actual driving impairment'
- 'Step 2: THC remains detectable in blood long after psychoactive effects have subsided,
  unlike alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Drivers who are not impaired test positive for THC due to recent (but not
  current) marijuana use'
- 'Step 4: Net widening effect criminalizes functionally unimpaired drivers, creating
  legal consequences without public safety benefit'

    THC levels without impairment, increasing the population vulnerable to criminalization

    periods, creating persistent vulnerability to arrest even when driving unimpaired
