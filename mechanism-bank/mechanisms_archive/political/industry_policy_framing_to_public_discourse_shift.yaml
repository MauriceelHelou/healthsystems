  node_name: Shift in Public Discourse on Alcohol Harms
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry trade associations develop strategic framing techniques to shape
  how alcohol-related issues are discussed in policy arenas'
- 'Step 2: Through coordinated messaging, industry actors reframe alcohol as primarily
  an economic good rather than a health risk'
- 'Step 3: Dominant industry narratives shift public and policymaker understanding
  away from population-level health impacts'
- 'Step 4: Altered discourse creates political environment hostile to evidence-based
  alcohol control measures'
