direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher severity of alcohol use patterns results in more frequent drinking
  episodes and higher blood alcohol concentrations'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with severe alcohol use have greater difficulty maintaining
  abstinence or low-level consumption before driving'
- 'Step 3: Increased frequency and intensity of drinking leads to more attempts to
  start vehicle with BAC above interlock threshold (.025)'
- 'Step 4: Higher number of high BAC readings (>.08) relative to clean blows (≤.025)
  results in elevated lockout ratios'
