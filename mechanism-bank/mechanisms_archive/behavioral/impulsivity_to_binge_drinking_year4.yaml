direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with higher impulsivity have reduced capacity for self-regulation
  and delayed gratification'
- 'Step 2: Impulsive individuals are more likely to act on immediate drinking opportunities
  without considering long-term consequences'
- 'Step 3: Impulsivity emerges as predictor specifically in Year 4, potentially when
  drinking patterns have become more established and habitual'
- 'Step 4: Reduced executive control allows environmental cues and social situations
  to more readily trigger binge drinking episodes'
