direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic intermittent alcohol exposure (5 weeks of 20% ethanol access) alters
  stress response systems'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol history modifies behavioral responses to traumatic stress exposure
  (predator odor)'
- 'Step 3: Animals with alcohol drinking history show altered contextual avoidance
  patterns measured 24 hours post-stress'
