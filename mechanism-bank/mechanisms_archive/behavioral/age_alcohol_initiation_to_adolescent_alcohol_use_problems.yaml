direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Earlier age of alcohol initiation increases total years of exposure during
  critical neurodevelopmental periods'
- 'Step 2: Adolescent brain development (prefrontal cortex maturation) is disrupted
  by early alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 3: This disruption impairs executive function, impulse control, and risk assessment'
- 'Step 4: Impaired neurodevelopment increases vulnerability to problematic alcohol
  use patterns and related consequences during the college transition'
