direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Brief in-person episodic future thinking intervention focuses on cognitive
  simulation of future academic goals'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive engagement with future academic outcomes increases salience of
  long-term goals relative to immediate alcohol consumption rewards'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced future orientation modifies reward valuation and decreases alcohol
  demand intensity'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol demand translates to decreased overall alcohol consumption
  among heavy drinking college students'
