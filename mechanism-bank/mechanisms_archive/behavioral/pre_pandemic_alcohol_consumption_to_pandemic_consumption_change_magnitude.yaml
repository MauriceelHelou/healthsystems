direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher pre-pandemic consumption levels reflect established drinking patterns
  and physiological adaptation'
- 'Step 2: Pandemic structural changes disrupt routine drinking contexts and availability'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with higher baseline consumption have greater capacity for
  change in either direction'
- 'Step 4: Both increases and decreases in consumption more common among higher baseline
  consumers, demonstrating polarization'
