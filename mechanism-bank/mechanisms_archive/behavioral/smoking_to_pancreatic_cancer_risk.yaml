direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains multiple carcinogens (nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons) that enter systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Carcinogens are transported to pancreatic tissue where they cause direct
  DNA damage and mutations in tumor suppressor genes (p53, KRAS)'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure promotes oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in
  pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic damage and impaired DNA repair mechanisms increase
  likelihood of malignant cellular transformation'
