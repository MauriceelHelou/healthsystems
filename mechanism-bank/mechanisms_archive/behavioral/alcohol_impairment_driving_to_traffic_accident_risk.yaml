mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol acts as a central nervous system depressant, impairing cognitive
  alertness and muscle coordination'
- 'Step 2: Impaired drivers experience delayed response times in emergency situations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced coordination and delayed responses increase likelihood of collisions
  with obstacles or suddenly appearing objects'
- 'Step 4: Statistical evidence shows alcohol-impaired drivers have seven-fold increased
  accident causation rate'
