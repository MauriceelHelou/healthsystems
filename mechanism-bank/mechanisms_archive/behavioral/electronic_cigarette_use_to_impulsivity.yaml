to_node:
  node_id: impulsivity
  node_name: Impulsivity
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nicotine exposure through electronic cigarette use affects developing prefrontal
  cortex circuits responsible for impulse control during adolescence and young adulthood'
- 'Step 2: Chronic nicotine exposure alters dopamine signaling and reward processing
  pathways, increasing reward sensitivity and reducing behavioral inhibition'
- 'Step 3: Neuroadaptations in prefrontal-striatal circuits compromise top-down cognitive
  control over impulsive urges'
- 'Step 4: Elevated impulsivity may also precede and predict vaping initiation, creating
  a bidirectional relationship'
