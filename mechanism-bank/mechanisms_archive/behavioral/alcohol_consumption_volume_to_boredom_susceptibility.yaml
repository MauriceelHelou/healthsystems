direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular alcohol use provides easy stimulation and reward, potentially reducing
  engagement with other activities'
- 'Step 2: Neurobiological changes from chronic alcohol exposure may affect dopaminergic
  reward pathways, increasing need for stimulation'
- 'Step 3: Time and resources devoted to drinking may reduce opportunities for diverse
  activities that prevent boredom'
- 'Step 4: Social networks centered on drinking may offer fewer varied stimulation
  sources'
