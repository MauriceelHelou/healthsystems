to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher levels of alcohol consumption create repeated exposure to ethanol
  and its metabolites in the brain'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure leads to neuroadaptive changes in reward circuitry, stress
  response systems, and executive function regions'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes increase tolerance, withdrawal symptoms,
  and compulsive use patterns'
- 'Step 4: However, genetic variants mediate this transition such that consumption
  level alone does not fully explain AUD risk, with unique genetic factors influencing
  disorder susceptibility'

  description: The study demonstrates that unique genetic variants influence AUD risk
    independent of consumption, indicating that consumption level is a partial but
    not complete mediator of the relationship between genetic risk and disorder development

  description: Paper notes that consumption and AUD have opposite genetic correlations
    with psychiatric disorders, suggesting psychiatric factors moderate the consumption-to-disorder
