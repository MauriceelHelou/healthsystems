direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early alcohol exposure during adolescence occurs in contexts with less
  adult supervision and regulatory protection'
- 'Step 2: Youth who access alcohol early are disproportionately exposed to risky
  drinking environments and peer networks that normalize harmful behaviors'
- 'Step 3: These early patterns become reinforced through neurobiological changes
  and social learning during critical developmental windows'
- 'Step 4: Risky drinking patterns established in early adolescence persist into young
  adulthood (ages 20-25)'

  description: Similar to other outcomes, the association between early initiation
    and risky/delinquent behavior showed significant interaction with survey year,
    strengthening over time as early drinking became less normative
