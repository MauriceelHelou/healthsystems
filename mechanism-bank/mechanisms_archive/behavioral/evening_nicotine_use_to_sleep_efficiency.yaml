direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nicotine use within 4 hours of bedtime delivers a psychoactive stimulant
  to the central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine''s stimulant properties and its effects on neurotransmitter systems
  disrupt normal sleep-wake regulatory mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: This disruption increases arousal during the sleep period, leading to more
  frequent and/or longer awakenings'
- 'Step 4: The increased wakefulness reduces the percentage of time asleep while in
  bed, lowering sleep efficiency'
