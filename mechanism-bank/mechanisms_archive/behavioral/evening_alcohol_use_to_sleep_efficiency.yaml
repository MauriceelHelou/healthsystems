direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption within 4 hours of bedtime enters the bloodstream and
  affects central nervous system function'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts normal sleep architecture and arousal mechanisms during
  the sleep period'
- 'Step 3: This disruption leads to increased nighttime awakenings and reduced percentage
  of time asleep while in bed'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative effect is measurably lower sleep efficiency on that specific
  night'
