  node_name: Population Alcohol Per Capita Consumption (APC)
to_node:
  node_id: heavy_drinking_prevalence
  node_name: Prevalence of Heavy Drinking
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption in populations displays a fixed distributional shape
  with no clear distinction between heavy drinkers and other drinkers'
- 'Step 2: When mean consumption (APC) increases, the entire consumption distribution
  shifts upward'
- 'Step 3: This shift includes movement of the heavy drinking tail of the distribution,
  increasing the prevalence of heavy drinkers'
- 'Step 4: The close association between mean consumption and heavy drinking prevalence
  is maintained across different population contexts'
