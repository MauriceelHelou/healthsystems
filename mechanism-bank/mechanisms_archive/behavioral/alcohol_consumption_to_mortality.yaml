direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption affects multiple organ systems including liver, cardiovascular
  system, and nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to development of alcohol-attributable diseases
  including cirrhosis, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases'
- 'Step 3: These diseases contribute to premature mortality across populations'
