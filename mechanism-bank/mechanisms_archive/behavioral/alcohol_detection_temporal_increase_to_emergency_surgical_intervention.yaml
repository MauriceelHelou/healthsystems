direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increasing alcohol involvement in violence (10% to 43% positive detection)
  suggests more severe intoxication levels over time'
- 'Step 2: Higher intoxication levels associated with more aggressive violence and
  use of available weapons'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-impaired judgment leads to more severe force application and deeper
  penetrating injuries'
- 'Step 4: Greater injury severity requires immediate surgical intervention rather
  than conservative management'
