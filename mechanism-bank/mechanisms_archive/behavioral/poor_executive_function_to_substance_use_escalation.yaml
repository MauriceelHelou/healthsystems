direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Impaired executive function reduces capacity for self-regulation and future-oriented
  decision making'
- 'Step 2: Deficits in working memory and impulse control limit ability to evaluate
  risks of substance experimentation'
- 'Step 3: Poor executive function predicts initiation with weaker substances (caffeine,
  alcohol sipping)'
- 'Step 4: Continued executive dysfunction facilitates progression over time to use
  of progressively stronger psychotropic substances'
