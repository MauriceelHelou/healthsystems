mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-risk status (determined by sex, impulsivity, and family history) reflects
  underlying neurobiological vulnerability to alcohol reinforcement'
- 'Step 2: These individuals demonstrate similar rates of achieving binge-level blood
  alcohol concentration (≥80 mg%) as heavy drinkers during self-administration sessions'
- 'Step 3: Despite being classified as social drinkers, high-risk individuals display
  consumption patterns comparable to those with established heavy drinking behavior'
