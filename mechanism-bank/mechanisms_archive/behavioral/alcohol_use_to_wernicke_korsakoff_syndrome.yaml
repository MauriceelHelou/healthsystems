direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption interferes with thiamine absorption in the gastrointestinal
  tract and impairs thiamine phosphorylation to its active form'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol use often co-occurs with poor nutritional intake and dietary
  patterns low in thiamine-rich foods'
- 'Step 3: Combined effects of reduced thiamine absorption and inadequate dietary
  intake lead to progressive thiamine deficiency'
- 'Step 4: Thiamine depletion causes neurological damage characteristic of Wernicke-Korsakoff
  Syndrome'
