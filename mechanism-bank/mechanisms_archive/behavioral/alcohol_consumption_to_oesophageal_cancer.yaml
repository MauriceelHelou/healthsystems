to_node:
  node_id: oesophageal_cancer
  node_name: Oesophageal Cancer
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Direct contact of alcohol with oesophageal mucosa causes local tissue damage
  and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde accumulation in oesophageal tissue causes DNA adduct formation
  and mutagenesis'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-induced nutritional deficiencies (folate, vitamins) impair DNA
  methylation and repair'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammation promotes cellular proliferation and carcinogenic progression'
