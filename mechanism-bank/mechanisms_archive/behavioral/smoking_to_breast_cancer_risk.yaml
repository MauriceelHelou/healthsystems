mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains carcinogenic compounds including polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbons and nitrosamines'
- 'Step 2: Carcinogens are absorbed and circulated to breast tissue, causing DNA adduct
  formation'
- 'Step 3: Tobacco-related compounds induce oxidative stress and impair DNA repair
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated genetic damage increases malignant transformation of breast
  cells'

  description: 'Smoking association only statistically significant in 1950s birth
    cohort (HR 1.45 [1.14-1.84]) compared to earlier cohorts (1940s: HR 1.25 [0.99-1.58];
    1930s: HR 1.06 [0.85-1.32]; 1920s: HR 0.86 [0.69-1.08]). Effect size progressively
    increases with younger birth cohorts.'
