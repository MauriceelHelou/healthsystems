  node_name: Prenatal Alcohol Exposure
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inadequate knowledge of specific teratogenic risks of alcohol during pregnancy
  reduces perceived severity of consuming alcohol while pregnant or trying to conceive'
- 'Step 2: Without clear, prominent warnings about pregnancy-specific risks (distinct
  from general ''responsible drinking'' messages), pregnant women may not recognize
  need for complete abstinence'
- 'Step 3: Absence of standardized warnings across all products prevents reinforcement
  of abstinence messaging at repeated purchase and consumption occasions'
- 'Step 4: Lack of information about safe alternatives or timing of risk (all trimesters)
  may lead to unintentional exposure, particularly in early pregnancy before recognition'
