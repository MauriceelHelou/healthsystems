direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated population-level alcohol consumption increases prevalence of heavy
  drinking episodes and chronic high-risk consumption patterns'
- 'Step 2: Higher consumption levels lead to increased incidence of acute harms (injuries,
  violence) and chronic conditions (liver disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease)'
- 'Step 3: Social harms accumulate including family disruption, workplace impacts,
  and broader community effects'
- 'Step 4: Overall burden of alcohol-related mortality, morbidity, and social harm
  increases at population level'
