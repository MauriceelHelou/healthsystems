- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related hookups create contexts of impaired judgment and reduced
  health-protective behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Reduced condom use and other protective measures increase risk of sexually

  follow hookup experiences'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to these risks across adolescence and young adulthood
  leads to multiple negative health outcomes'
