to_node:
  node_id: myocardial_infarction
  node_name: Myocardial Infarction
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption was measured and adjusted for as a covariate in the
  multivariate analysis'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol may affect myocardial infarction risk through multiple pathways
  including cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and metabolic syndrome'
- 'Step 3: The study controlled for alcohol consumption to isolate the independent
  effect of occult gastrointestinal bleeding'
- 'Step 4: The relationship between alcohol and MI may be modified by drinking patterns,
  quantity, and individual susceptibility'
