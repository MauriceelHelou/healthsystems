  node_name: Court-Mandated Intervention Program Dropout Rate
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High alcohol consumption/misuse impairs cognitive functioning including
  emotional decoding abilities'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-related cognitive deficits reduce capacity to engage with and benefit
  from intervention program content'
- 'Step 3: Impaired emotional information processing and behavioral regulation reduce
  treatment adherence'
- 'Step 4: Higher dropout rates occur among perpetrators with alcohol misuse, particularly
  those with concurrent cognitive impairments'
