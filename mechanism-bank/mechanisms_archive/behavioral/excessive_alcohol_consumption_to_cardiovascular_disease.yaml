mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption acts as a modifiable cardiovascular risk
  factor'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure contributes to metabolic dysregulation and cardiovascular
  pathophysiology'
- 'Step 3: These biological changes increase probability of fatal and non-fatal cardiac
  events including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation'

  description: Excessive alcohol consumption operates alongside other modifiable risk
    factors (smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, diet, physical
    inactivity) to collectively increase cardiovascular risk
