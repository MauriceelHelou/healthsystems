direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderation or elimination of alcohol consumption reduces direct vasoconstrictive
  effects and sympathetic nervous system activation'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol intake decreases inflammation and oxidative stress in vascular
  endothelium'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption improves endothelial function and reduces peripheral
  vascular resistance'
- 'Step 4: These physiological changes result in measurable decreases in systolic
  and diastolic blood pressure'
