  experiences'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure to high-intensity drinking contexts reinforces desire
  for varied and novel experiences'

  settings that normalize experience-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Neuroadaptation to alcohol''s effects may increase general novelty-seeking
  to achieve similar stimulation'
