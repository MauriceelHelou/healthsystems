direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher disinhibition predisposes individuals to engage in less restrained
  behaviors including substance use'
- 'Step 2: Reduced behavioral inhibition lowers perceived risk and increases willingness
  to consume alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Social environments that normalize drinking interact with disinhibited
  personalities to increase consumption frequency and volume'
