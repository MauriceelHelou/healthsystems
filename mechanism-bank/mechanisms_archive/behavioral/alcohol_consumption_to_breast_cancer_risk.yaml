direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption increases acetaldehyde exposure and oxidative stress
  in breast tissue'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol modulates estrogen metabolism and increases circulating estrogen
  levels'
- 'Step 3: Elevated estrogen promotes cellular proliferation and DNA damage in breast
  tissue'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative DNA damage and hormonal stimulation increase breast cancer risk'

  description: 'Association only statistically significant in 1950s birth cohort (HR
    1.22 [1.01-1.48]) compared to earlier cohorts (1940s: HR 1.15 [0.96-1.38]; 1930s:
    HR 1.10 [0.90-1.33]; 1920s: HR 1.07 [0.91-1.26]). Younger cohorts show stronger
    alcohol-cancer associations.'
