- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption impairs cognitive function, reaction time, and motor
  coordination'
- 'Step 2: Impaired drivers have reduced ability to perceive hazards and respond appropriately
  to traffic conditions'
- 'Step 3: Delayed reactions and poor decision-making lead to increased crash risk'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related crashes result in injuries and fatalities'
