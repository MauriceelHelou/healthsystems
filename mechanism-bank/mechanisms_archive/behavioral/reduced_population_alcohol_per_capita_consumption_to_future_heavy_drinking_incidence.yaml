  node_id: future_heavy_drinking_incidence
  node_name: Future Incidence of Heavy Drinking
direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower population mean consumption creates a drinking environment with reduced
  social normalization of heavy drinking'
- 'Step 2: Reduced overall availability and consumption reduces opportunities for
  individuals to escalate drinking patterns over time'
- 'Step 3: Lower population consumption prevents the development of very heavy drinking
  trajectories by reducing exposure during critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 4: Fewer individuals progress to become very heavy drinkers who cause severe
  health and social problems'
