direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use in early adolescence (ages 9-12) occurs during critical neurodevelopmental
  period affecting prefrontal cortex maturation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure disrupts neural circuits involved in impulse control,
  emotion regulation, and decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Impaired cognitive and emotional regulation systems reduce capacity to
  cope with stressors and negative emotions'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-related disinhibition combined with dysregulated emotional processing
  increases risk for suicidal ideation and attempts'
