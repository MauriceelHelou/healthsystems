mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression disrupts emotional regulation circuits in the prefrontal cortex
  and limbic system'
- 'Step 2: Impaired emotional regulation reduces ability to manage negative emotions
  without external coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Food consumption, particularly palatable foods, becomes a maladaptive strategy
  to regulate negative emotional states'
- 'Step 4: Repeated use of food for emotional regulation establishes emotional eating
  patterns independent of physiological hunger'
