mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IFN-γ treatment enhances stem cell adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation
  capacity and proliferative ability'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced stem cells reduce Schwann cell apoptosis and neuroinflammation
  in diabetic nerve tissue'
- 'Step 3: Reduced apoptosis and inflammation lead to decreased pathological nerve
  fiber damage as visualized by H&E staining'
- 'Step 4: Preserved nerve fiber structure improves tactile and thermal pain sensation'
