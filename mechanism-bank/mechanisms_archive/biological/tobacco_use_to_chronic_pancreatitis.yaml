direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic tobacco exposure causes sustained oxidative stress and inflammation
  in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine and tobacco toxins promote pancreatic stellate cell activation
  and fibrogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Repeated inflammatory insults lead to progressive pancreatic fibrosis and
  structural damage'
- 'Step 4: Tobacco may accelerate progression from acute to chronic pancreatitis'
- 'Step 5: Males experience disproportionately higher rates due to greater cumulative
  tobacco exposure over time'
