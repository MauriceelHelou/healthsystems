category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of alcohol problems may reflect genetic or environmental
  transmission of risk factors for impulsivity-related behaviors'
- 'Step 2: These risk factors could theoretically influence neurodevelopmental pathways
  related to reward processing and temporal decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Altered reward processing could manifest as steeper delay discounting (preference
  for immediate over delayed rewards)'
- 'Step 4: However, empirical evidence from this study found no association between
  family history of alcohol problems and delay discounting behavior in children'

  description: Sociodemographic factors played a larger role in predicting delay discounting
    behavior than family history of psychopathology, suggesting that structural determinants
    may override familial risk factors
