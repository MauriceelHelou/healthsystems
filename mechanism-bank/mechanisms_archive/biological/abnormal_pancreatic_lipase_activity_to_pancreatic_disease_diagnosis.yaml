direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pancreatic pathology (from gallstones, alcohol, or other causes) disrupts
  normal pancreatic lipase enzyme production and secretion'
- 'Step 2: Abnormal lipase activity levels serve as biomarker of pancreatic disease
  severity and progression'
- 'Step 3: Novel fluorescent probe LPP detects pancreatic lipase activity with high
  specificity (detection limit 0.012 U/mL) within 10 minutes'
- 'Step 4: Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) enables real-time monitoring of dynamic
  changes in lipase activity'
- 'Step 5: Early detection of abnormal lipase activity enables timely diagnosis and
  monitoring of severe acute pancreatitis'
