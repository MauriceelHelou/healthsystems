direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure causes permanent structural changes in
  developing fetal brain regions responsible for sleep regulation'
- 'Step 2: These neurological alterations result in chronic dysregulation of sleep-wake
  cycles that cannot be fully compensated for developmentally'
- 'Step 3: Sleep problems persist continuously from toddlerhood through middle childhood
  rather than resolving with typical development'
- 'Step 4: Probability of persistent sleep problems across the 2-9 year age range
  increases substantially for heavily exposed children'
