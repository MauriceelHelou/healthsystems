direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood maltreatment leads to reduced prefrontal-paralimbic gray matter
  volume through stress-related neurodevelopmental disruption'
- 'Step 2: Reduced gray matter volume in prefrontal regions impairs executive function,
  emotional regulation, and impulse control'
- 'Step 3: Lower insula GMV specifically associates with increased substance use as
  a maladaptive coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Structural brain changes create neurobiological vulnerability to developing
  substance use patterns and disorders'
