direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of alcohol use disorder indicates inherited genetic variants
  affecting limbic system development'
- 'Step 2: These genetic factors specifically influence amygdala structure and development
  during neurodevelopmental periods'
- 'Step 3: Smaller amygdala volumes result in individuals with positive family history,
  potentially affecting emotional regulation and stress response'
- 'Step 4: These structural differences may increase vulnerability to alcohol use
  disorder through altered reward sensitivity and stress reactivity'
