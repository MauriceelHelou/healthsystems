  node_id: cns_neurocognitive_impairment

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis compounds (cannabinoids) interact with the developing adolescent
  brain during critical maturation processes involving white matter density increases
  and gray matter pruning'
- 'Step 2: Cannabinoid exposure disrupts normal neurodevelopmental trajectories in
  the central nervous system'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted brain maturation leads to alterations in neural structure and
  function affecting cognitive processing and sensory systems'
- 'Step 4: Structural and functional CNS changes manifest as impairments in cognitive
  function and sensory processing'
