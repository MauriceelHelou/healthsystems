direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Continued alcohol consumption in patients with advanced ALD (cirrhosis
  or acute alcoholic hepatitis) perpetuates hepatotoxic insult'
- 'Step 2: Ongoing liver inflammation and cellular injury accelerates progression
  of fibrosis and hepatic decompensation'
- 'Step 3: Increased risk of complications including variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy,
  hepatorenal syndrome, and liver failure'
- 'Step 4: These complications directly increase mortality risk among patients with
  advanced liver disease'

  description: The relationship between ongoing alcohol use and mortality is particularly
    strong in patients with cirrhosis or acute alcoholic hepatitis, making total abstinence
    critically important in advanced disease
