to_node:
  node_id: axonal_atrophy
  node_name: Axonal Atrophy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dysregulated Schwann cell plasticity impairs their ability to provide trophic
  support to axons'
- 'Step 2: Loss of Schwann cell-mediated neuronal support compromises axonal maintenance
  and metabolism'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate glial support, axons undergo progressive structural deterioration
  and atrophy'
