direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during neurodevelopment disrupts the formation and refinement
  of functional brain modules'
- 'Step 2: Neurotoxic effects of alcohol interfere with the organization of brain
  regions into distinct communities with specialized functions'
- 'Step 3: Reduced modularity reflects breakdown of optimal network organization where
  regions within modules show less coordinated structural development'
- 'Step 4: Loss of modular structure indicates decreased specialization and efficiency
  of brain network organization'
