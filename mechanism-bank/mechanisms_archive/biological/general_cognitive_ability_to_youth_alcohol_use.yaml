direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher general cognitive ability at ages 9-10 years reflects enhanced overall
  neurocognitive functioning'
- 'Step 2: Youth with higher cognitive abilities may process social contexts differently,
  recognizing alcohol''s social acceptability and normative status in US culture'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced cognitive processing of social norms may lead to formation of
  more positive expectancies for alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Positive expectancies increase likelihood of alcohol experimentation by
  ages 13-14 years'
