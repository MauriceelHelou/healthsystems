direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-compromised immune cell function reduces capacity to recognize
  and respond to pathogens'
- 'Step 2: Impaired immune surveillance and response mechanisms fail to adequately
  control microbial threats'
- 'Step 3: Increased susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections occurs
  across multiple pathogen types'
- 'Step 4: Higher infection rates manifest in populations with hazardous alcohol use'
