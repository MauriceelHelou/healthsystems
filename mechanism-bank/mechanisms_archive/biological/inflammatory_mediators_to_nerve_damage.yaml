direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic ethanol intake and other exposures trigger release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and mediators'
- 'Step 2: Inflammatory mediators activate immune responses in peripheral nerve tissues'
- 'Step 3: Sustained inflammation damages nerve axons, myelin sheaths, and supporting
  Schwann cells'
- 'Step 4: Progressive inflammatory damage leads to sensory and motor nerve dysfunction
  characteristic of peripheral neuropathy'
