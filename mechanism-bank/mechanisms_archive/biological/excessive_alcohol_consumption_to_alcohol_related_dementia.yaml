  node_name: Alcohol-Related Dementia (ARD)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption exceeding recommended limits causes direct
  neurotoxic effects on brain tissue'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure induces progressive cognitive disruption beyond
  transient, recoverable impairment'
- 'Step 3: Continued heavy drinking without abstinence leads to development of alcohol-related
  dementia'
- 'Step 4: ARD remains poorly diagnosed and addressed despite being a relatively non-progressive
  or partially reversible condition in abstinent ex-drinkers'
