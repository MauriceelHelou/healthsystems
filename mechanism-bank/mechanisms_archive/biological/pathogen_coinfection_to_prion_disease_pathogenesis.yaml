- 'Step 1: Co-infection with other pathogens modulates immune system function and
  activation'
- 'Step 2: Altered immune responses affect the targeting of peripherally-acquired
  prions to lymphoid organs'
- 'Step 3: Changes in immune cell populations influence prion replication and transmission
  efficiency'
- 'Step 4: Modified immune environment affects prion disease progression and severity'
