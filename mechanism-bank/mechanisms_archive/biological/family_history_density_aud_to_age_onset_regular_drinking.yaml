  node_name: Age of Onset of Regular Drinking
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher family history density of AUD indicates greater genetic vulnerability
  and familial environmental exposure to alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Genetic factors influence neurodevelopmental trajectories affecting impulse
  control and reward sensitivity during adolescence'
- 'Step 3: Combined with household alcohol availability and modeling, this accelerates
  initiation of regular drinking patterns'
- 'Step 4: Earlier age of onset of regular drinking results from convergence of genetic
  susceptibility and familial environment'
