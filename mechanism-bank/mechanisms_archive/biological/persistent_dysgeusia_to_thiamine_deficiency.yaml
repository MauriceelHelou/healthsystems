to_node:
  node_id: thiamine_deficiency
  node_name: Thiamine Deficiency
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persistent dysgeusia impairs appetite and alters food preferences, reducing
  overall nutritional intake'
- 'Step 2: Decreased consumption of thiamine-rich foods (whole grains, legumes, meat)
  leads to inadequate dietary thiamine'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged inadequate intake depletes body thiamine stores, resulting in
  clinical thiamine deficiency'
