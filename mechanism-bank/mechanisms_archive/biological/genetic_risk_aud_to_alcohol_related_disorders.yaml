to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_related_disorders
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Disorders
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants specifically associated with AUD diagnosis (distinct from
  consumption variants) influence disorder susceptibility'
- 'Step 2: Polygenic risk scores for AUD capture genetic liability for clinical disorder
  independent of consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: AUD-specific genetic architecture operates through distinct biological
  pathways including stress response and reward processing'
- 'Step 4: Higher AUD genetic risk increases probability of developing clinical alcohol-related
  disorders through mechanisms beyond heavy drinking alone'
