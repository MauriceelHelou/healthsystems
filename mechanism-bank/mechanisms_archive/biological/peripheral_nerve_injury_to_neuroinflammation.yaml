direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peripheral nerve damage triggers inflammatory cascade activation'
- 'Step 2: Mast cell activation occurs at injury site releasing inflammatory mediators'
- 'Step 3: NF-κB pathway activation leads to increased cytokine release'
- 'Step 4: Sustained neuroinflammation impairs nerve repair and regeneration processes'
