direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic pancreatitis causes destruction of pancreatic exocrine tissue and
  reduced enzyme secretion'
- 'Step 2: Pancreatic insufficiency leads to fat malabsorption and steatorrhea'
- 'Step 3: Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (D and K) impairs calcium homeostasis
  and bone formation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic nutritional deficiencies and inflammation promote progressive bone
  loss leading to osteoporosis'
