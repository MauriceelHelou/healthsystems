mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Corticosteroids reduce inflammation in peripheral nerve tissues that contributes
  to pain signaling'
- 'Step 2: Anti-inflammatory effects decrease sensitization of pain receptors and
  pathways'
- 'Step 3: Nerve block effects provide direct pain relief at the site of peripheral
  nerve pathology'
