  node_id: all_cause_mortality
  node_name: All-Cause Mortality
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Occult gastrointestinal bleeding indicates underlying gastrointestinal
  or systemic pathology'
- 'Step 2: Chronic blood loss leads to anemia, reduced functional capacity, and systemic
  physiological stress'
- 'Step 3: Occult bleeding may reflect broader vascular disease, inflammation, or
  multiple comorbidities'
- 'Step 4: Combined cardiovascular risk elevation and potential undiagnosed conditions
  increase overall mortality risk'
