direction: 'null'
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants associated with glucocorticoid use served as instrumental
  variables to assess causal relationship with chronic pancreatitis'
- 'Step 2: Mendelian randomization analysis tested whether genetically predicted glucocorticoid
  use affects chronic pancreatitis development'
- 'Step 3: Multiple MR approaches (IVW, MR-Egger, weighted median) consistently demonstrated
  no causal effect'
- 'Step 4: Findings replicated across European ancestry, East Asian, and Finnish populations
  with adjustment for alcohol and other confounders'
