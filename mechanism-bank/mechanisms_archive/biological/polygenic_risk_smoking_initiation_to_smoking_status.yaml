direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants associated with smoking initiation aggregate into a polygenic
  risk score that reflects inherited biological predisposition'
- 'Step 2: These genetic variants influence neurobiological pathways including nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors and dopaminergic reward systems'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with higher PRS have increased biological susceptibility to
  initiate and maintain smoking behavior'
- 'Step 4: The polygenic risk translates into observable smoking status differences
  in the population'
