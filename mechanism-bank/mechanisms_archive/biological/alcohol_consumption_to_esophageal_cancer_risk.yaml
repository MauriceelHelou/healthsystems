direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Direct contact of alcohol with esophageal mucosa causes cellular damage
  and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde accumulation in esophageal tissue creates sustained carcinogenic
  exposure'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol depletes protective antioxidants and impairs mucosal barrier function'
- 'Step 4: Repeated exposure leads to cellular dysplasia and increased risk of esophageal
  adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma'
