- 'Step 1: Repeated application of cerulein or cerulein plus NOD1 ligand causes recurrent
  pancreatic injury'
- 'Step 2: Multiple episodes prevent complete tissue healing and recovery'
- 'Step 3: Persistent inflammation leads to progressive fibrosis and structural changes'
- 'Step 4: Permanent damage results in endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
  characteristic of chronic pancreatitis'
