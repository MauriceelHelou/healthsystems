direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predisposition to affective disorders may involve shared genetic
  variants affecting both metabolic and mood regulation'
- 'Step 2: Pleiotropic genes influence both metabolic pathways (insulin signaling,
  adiposity) and neurobiological systems (neurotransmitter function)'
- 'Step 3: Genetic risk manifests as increased vulnerability to metabolic dysregulation
  even before affective disorder onset'
- 'Step 4: High-risk individuals show elevated MetS prevalence (15%) compared to low-risk
  individuals (2.5%), independent of manifest psychiatric illness'

    but these lifestyle factors were controlled as potential confounders, suggesting
    environmental triggers interact with genetic risk
