mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal Western-style diet alters maternal gut microbiota composition'
- 'Step 2: Components of maternal microbiota are transferred from mothers to offspring
  during pregnancy and birth'
- 'Step 3: Transferred microbiota influences development of neonatal innate and adaptive
  immune systems'
- 'Step 4: Altered microbial exposure during critical developmental windows programs
  abnormal immune cell development in bone marrow and fetal liver'
