  node_id: pea_administration
  node_name: Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) Administration
to_node:
  node_id: regulatory_t_cell_differentiation
  node_name: Regulatory T Cell Differentiation
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PEA is administered in experimental conditions'
- 'Step 2: PEA selectively targets pathogenic T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17)'
- 'Step 3: PEA does not affect regulatory T cell differentiation pathways or transcription
  factors'
- 'Step 4: Regulatory T cells, which prevent autoimmune disease onset, remain functionally
  intact'
