direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic pancreatitis involves repeated episodes of inflammation and tissue
  injury over time'
- 'Step 2: Progressive fibrosis and destruction of pancreatic parenchyma accumulates
  with longer disease duration'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative tissue loss results in measurable reduction in pancreatic dimensions
  (atrophy) that worsens over time'
