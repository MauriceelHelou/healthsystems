direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Blockade or absence of β2-AR prevents noradrenaline-mediated immune modulation'
- 'Step 2: Without β2-AR signaling, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells maintain enhanced cytokine
  production capacity'
- 'Step 3: Increased interferon-gamma production by T cells enhances cellular immune
  response'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced immune response leads to lower pathogen burden and reduced infection
  severity'
