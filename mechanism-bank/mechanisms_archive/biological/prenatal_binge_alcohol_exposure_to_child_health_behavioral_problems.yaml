direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women who binge-drink during pregnancy expose the developing fetus to teratogenic
  effects of alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts normal fetal brain development and physiological systems
  through multiple biological mechanisms including epigenetic changes'
- 'Step 3: These developmental disruptions result in increased likelihood of health
  problems and behavioral difficulties in offspring'
- 'Step 4: Effects may be mediated through altered DNA methylation patterns that persist
  from birth through childhood development'

  description: Female offspring may be more susceptible to epigenetic changes from
    prenatal alcohol exposure, potentially leading to differential health and behavioral
    outcomes by sex

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Effects may vary depending on which trimester(s) exposure occurred,
    as measured across all three trimesters in the study
