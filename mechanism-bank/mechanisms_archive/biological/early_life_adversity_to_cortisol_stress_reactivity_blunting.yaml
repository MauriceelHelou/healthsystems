direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to adverse events during critical developmental periods (by age
  15) affects stress response system maturation'
- 'Step 2: Progressive blunting of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function
  occurs with increasing levels of adversity exposure'
- 'Step 3: Blunted cortisol reactivity emerges as a neurobiological adaptation to
  chronic early stress exposure'
- 'Step 4: This effect is moderated by family history of alcoholism, with FH+ individuals
  showing vulnerability while FH- individuals demonstrate resilience'
