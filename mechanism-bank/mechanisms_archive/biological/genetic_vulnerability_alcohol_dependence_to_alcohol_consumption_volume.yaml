direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predisposition to alcohol dependence alters reward processing and
  reinforcement sensitivity in neural circuits'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with genetic liability (modeled by P rats) show heightened
  reinforcing effects of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced reinforcement drives increased volume of alcohol consumed during
  drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: Greater consumption further reinforces drinking behavior through neuroadaptive
  changes in reward circuitry'
