direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol misuse creates ''at-risk'' status for thiamine deficiency through
  nutritional and metabolic effects'
- 'Step 2: Asymptomatic at-risk patients have depleted thiamine reserves without overt
  neurological symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Additional stressors or continued alcohol use can precipitate acute Wernicke''s
  encephalopathy'
- 'Step 4: Study 1 examined prevention strategies for 393 asymptomatic but at-risk
  alcohol misuse patients'
