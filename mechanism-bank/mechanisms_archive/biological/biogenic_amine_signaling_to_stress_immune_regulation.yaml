- 'Step 1: Environmental stressors trigger release and signaling of biogenic amines
  including tyramine'
- 'Step 2: Biogenic amines act as neuromodulators regulating stress response pathways'
- 'Step 3: Stress response signaling modulates immune system activation and regulation'
- 'Step 4: Coordinated stress and immune responses determine capacity to resist environmental
  challenges and infections'
