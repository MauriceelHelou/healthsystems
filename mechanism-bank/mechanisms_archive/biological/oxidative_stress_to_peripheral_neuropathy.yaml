direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Oxidative stress from NOX-4 overexpression damages peripheral nerve cells'
- 'Step 2: Nerve damage impairs sensory function and nerve conduction velocity'
- 'Step 3: Impaired nerve function manifests as mechanical hyperalgesia, allodynia,
  and reduced response latency'
- 'Step 4: Progressive nerve damage results in clinical diabetic peripheral neuropathy'
