direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of metabolic traits indicates genetic predisposition to
  metabolic dysfunction including insulin resistance, lipid dysregulation, and inflammatory
  pathways'
- 'Step 2: Inherited genetic variants affect hepatic metabolism of alcohol and cellular
  responses to oxidative stress even before clinical manifestation of metabolic disease'
- 'Step 3: Genetic susceptibility combined with alcohol exposure creates heightened
  vulnerability to hepatotoxic effects through impaired detoxification and increased
  inflammatory responses'
- 'Step 4: Earlier and more severe liver damage occurs in individuals with inherited
  metabolic susceptibility even with smaller alcohol quantities and shorter exposure
  duration'
