direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol acts as a teratogen crossing the placental barrier during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure disrupts fetal neurodevelopment and cellular processes
  throughout gestation'
- 'Step 3: Teratogenic effects result in neurocognitive impairment, structural defects,
  and growth restriction'
- 'Step 4: These developmental disruptions manifest as Fetal Alcohol Syndrome with
  lifelong consequences'
