  node_name: Declining Housing Trajectory After Initial Stability
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorders initially may not prevent housing acquisition when
  Housing First removes sobriety requirements'
- 'Step 2: Over time, physiological effects of alcohol dependence and withdrawal cycles
  may interfere with maintaining housing-related responsibilities'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol use may exacerbate social isolation or conflict with neighbors,
  increasing housing instability risk'
- 'Step 4: Without adequate treatment intensity or harm reduction supports for alcohol
  use disorders, individuals experience housing decline despite initial stability'
