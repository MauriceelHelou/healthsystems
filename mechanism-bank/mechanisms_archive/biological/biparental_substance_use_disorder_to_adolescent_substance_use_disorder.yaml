mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dual parental SUD creates compounded genetic vulnerability from both maternal
  and paternal inheritance of addiction susceptibility genes'
- 'Step 2: Household environment with both parents having SUD creates severe disruptions
  to family stability, supervision, and protective factors'
- 'Step 3: Children experience heightened exposure to substance use normalization,
  trauma, and adverse childhood experiences'
- 'Step 4: Synergistic effects of genetic loading and severely compromised home environment
  substantially elevate adolescent SUD risk'
