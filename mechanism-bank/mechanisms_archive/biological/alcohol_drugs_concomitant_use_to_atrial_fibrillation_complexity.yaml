direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol and drug use contributes to elevated HAS-BLED bleeding risk scores'
- 'Step 2: Higher HAS-BLED scores (which include drugs/alcohol as component) associated
  with increased clinical complexity and comorbidity burden'
- 'Step 3: Clinicians preferentially select ICE-guided procedures for patients with
  elevated risk profiles including alcohol/drug use'
