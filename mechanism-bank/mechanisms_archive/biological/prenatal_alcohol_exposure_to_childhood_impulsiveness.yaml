to_node:
  node_id: childhood_impulsiveness
  node_name: Childhood Impulsiveness
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fetal alcohol exposure disrupts development of prefrontal cortex and impulse
  control circuits'
- 'Step 2: Structural brain alterations occur in regions governing behavioral inhibition'
- 'Step 3: Changes in brain volume and structure affect impulse regulation capacity'
- 'Step 4: Brain structure differences partially mediate increased impulsive behaviors
  in childhood'
