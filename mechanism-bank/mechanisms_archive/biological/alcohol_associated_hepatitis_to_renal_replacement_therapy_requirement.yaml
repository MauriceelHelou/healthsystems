direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-associated hepatitis causes more severe hepatic dysfunction and
  systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Greater inflammation and hemodynamic instability lead to more severe acute
  kidney injury'
- 'Step 3: Severe AKI progresses to need for renal support beyond medical management'
- 'Step 4: Higher proportion of patients require renal replacement therapy compared
  to non-AH cirrhosis with AKI'
