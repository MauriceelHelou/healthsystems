direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression alters neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, dopamine) that regulate
  mood and reward pathways'
- 'Step 2: Dysregulated reward pathways increase seeking of palatable foods as a coping
  mechanism for negative affect'
- 'Step 3: Repeated consumption of large quantities of food in response to depressive
  symptoms establishes binge eating patterns'
- 'Step 4: Binge eating may temporarily alleviate negative mood states through dopamine
  release, reinforcing the behavior'
