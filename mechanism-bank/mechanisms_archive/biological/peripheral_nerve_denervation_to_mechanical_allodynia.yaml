direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Loss of peripheral sensory nerve fibers alters pain signaling pathways'
- 'Step 2: Denervation triggers microglial hyperactivation in spinal dorsal horn'
- 'Step 3: Central sensitization occurs through increased astrocyte expression and
  glial cell activation'
- 'Step 4: Altered central processing results in mechanical allodynia despite peripheral
  nerve loss'
