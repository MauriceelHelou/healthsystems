  node_name: Mesocorticolimbic Brain Activity During Reward Anticipation
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic and familial risk factors for alcohol dependence are inherited
  through first-degree relatives'
- 'Step 2: First-degree relatives of alcohol-dependent individuals show altered neural
  processing patterns that may represent predisposing vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: During loss anticipation, at-risk individuals (first-degree relatives)
  demonstrate intermediate neural activity patterns in mesocorticolimbic regions between
  alcohol-dependent patients and healthy controls'
- 'Step 4: These altered neural reward processing patterns may increase vulnerability
  to developing alcohol dependence when exposed to environmental stressors or alcohol
  availability'
