  node_id: neuroinflammation_myoinositol
  node_name: Neuroinflammation (Elevated Myo-Inositol)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal HIV infection during pregnancy exposes fetus to inflammatory environment
  and potential effects of antiretroviral medications'
- 'Step 2: Prenatal exposure triggers persistent glial cell activation and reactivity
  in developing brain'
- 'Step 3: Glial reactivity manifests as elevated myo-inositol levels, particularly
  in white matter regions sensitive to inflammatory processes'
- 'Step 4: Neuroinflammatory processes continue postnatally, detectable at 2-3 years
  of age through elevated myo-inositol ratios'
