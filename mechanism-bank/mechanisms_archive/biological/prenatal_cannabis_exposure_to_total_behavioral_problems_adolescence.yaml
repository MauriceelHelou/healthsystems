direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal cannabis exposure affects multiple neurodevelopmental systems
  during critical periods of fetal brain formation'
- 'Step 2: Widespread neurodevelopmental alterations impact multiple behavioral domains
  including attention, emotional regulation, and behavioral control'
- 'Step 3: Effects persist across childhood and manifest as elevated overall behavioral
  problems by early adolescence'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral problems occur across multiple domains measured by CBCL total
  problems scale, independent of detectable changes in neurocognitive performance'
