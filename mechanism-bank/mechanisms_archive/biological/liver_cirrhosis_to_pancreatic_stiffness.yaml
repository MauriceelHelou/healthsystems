  node_id: pancreatic_stiffness
  node_name: Pancreatic Stiffness
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Liver cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension due to increased hepatic vascular
  resistance'
- 'Step 2: Portal hypertension causes splanchnic venous congestion affecting multiple
  organs including the pancreas'
- 'Step 3: Venous congestion and altered hemodynamics in pancreatic tissue increase
  tissue stiffness'
- 'Step 4: Elevated pancreatic stiffness measured by SWV reflects hemodynamic changes
  rather than intrinsic pancreatic disease'
