  node_id: pr_positive_breast_cancer
  node_name: Progesterone Receptor Positive (PR+) Breast Cancer
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PFOS acts as endocrine disruptor affecting progesterone signaling pathways'
- 'Step 2: Persistent chemical exposure accumulates through environmental contamination
  in water, soil, and food supply'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted progesterone receptor function alters breast tissue cell proliferation
  and differentiation'
- 'Step 4: Chronic endocrine disruption increases susceptibility to PR+ tumor development'
