  node_id: thiamine_deficiency

to_node:
  node_id: neurotransmitter_system_dysfunction
  node_name: Neurotransmitter System Dysfunction
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine deficiency impairs thiamine-dependent enzymes critical for neurotransmitter
  synthesis'
- 'Step 2: Disrupted glucose metabolism reduces ATP availability for neurotransmitter
  production and release'
- 'Step 3: Multiple neurotransmitter systems (acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA) are
  dysregulated'
- 'Step 4: Widespread neurotransmitter dysfunction contributes to neuropsychiatric
  symptoms and cognitive impairment'
