- 'Step 1: Severe alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens) causes extreme sympathetic hyperactivity with
  catecholamine surge'
- 'Step 2: Autonomic instability produces tachycardia (>140 bpm), severe hypertension, hyperthermia (>104°F),
  and diaphoresis'
- 'Step 3: Seizure activity occurs in 5-15% of severe withdrawal, with risk of status epilepticus and
  aspiration'
- 'Step 4: Cardiovascular strain can precipitate myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or stroke in vulnerable
  individuals'
- 'Step 5: Untreated or inadequately treated DT has 15-20% mortality from cardiovascular collapse, aspiration,
  or metabolic derangements'

structural_competency:

  equity_implications: Deaths from alcohol withdrawal are largely preventable with appropriate medical
    care, making mortality rates a measure of healthcare system failure. Individuals experiencing homelessness,
    incarceration, or lacking insurance face forced unmonitored withdrawal with inadequate benzodiazepine
    access. Correctional facilities often fail to recognize or treat withdrawal, leading to preventable
    deaths. Rural hospitals may lack protocols and ICU capacity. High withdrawal mortality in marginalized
    populations reflects structural violence through denial of evidence-based medical care to people with
    addiction.
assumptions:
- Assumes inadequate or no benzodiazepine treatment
- Mortality risk highest in first 48-72 hours after cessation
- Complications reflect untreated physiologic withdrawal, not all patients with severe withdrawal
limitations:
- With appropriate treatment, mortality is <1-2%, mechanism describes untreated or undertreated cases
- Individual physiologic reserve affects complication risk
- Does not capture deaths from aspiration pneumonia or trauma during withdrawal
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Withdrawal mortality varies by healthcare access, hospital protocols, and medical detoxification
    facility availability
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas lack ICU capacity and addiction medicine expertise
  - Correctional facilities show elevated mortality due to inadequate medical monitoring
  - States without Medicaid-funded detoxification rely on ED-based care with variable quality
  - Hospitals without standardized CIWA protocols show higher complication rates
