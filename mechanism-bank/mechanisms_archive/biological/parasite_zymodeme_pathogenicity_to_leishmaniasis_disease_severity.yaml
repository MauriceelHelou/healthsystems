- 'Step 1: Different Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis zymodemes (genetic subpopulations)
  exhibit varying pathogenicity characteristics independent of drug resistance'
- 'Step 2: Sb-resistant zymodeme 2.3 strains produce larger lesions in experimental
  models compared to Sb-sensitive zymodeme 2.2 strains'
- 'Step 3: Zymodeme 2.3 strains generate higher parasite burdens in host tissues'
- 'Step 4: Greater parasite burden and tissue damage result in more severe clinical
  disease presentation and outcomes'
