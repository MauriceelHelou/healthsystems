direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Presence of any family history of AUD (dichotomous measure) indicates genetic
  and familial environmental risk'
- 'Step 2: Simple presence/absence of family history captures threshold risk but misses
  gradient of familial loading'
- 'Step 3: Genetic and shared environmental factors contribute to increased AUD susceptibility'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with positive family history show elevated risk of AUD diagnosis,
  though with weaker associations than density measures'

  description: Density measures (vs. dichotomous) had greater diagnostic accuracy
    at classifying AUD diagnosis, with dichotomous measures presenting diagnostic
    accuracy closer to random chance
