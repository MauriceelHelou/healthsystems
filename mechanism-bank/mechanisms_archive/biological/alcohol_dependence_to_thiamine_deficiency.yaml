  node_id: thiamine_deficiency
  node_name: Thiamine Deficiency
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol dependence disrupts thiamine absorption and metabolism through
  direct gastrointestinal effects'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol consumption increases thiamine requirements while decreasing
  dietary intake'
- 'Step 3: Reduced thiamine storage and increased excretion further depletes thiamine
  reserves'
- 'Step 4: Severe thiamine deficiency develops in patients with sustained alcohol
  misuse'
