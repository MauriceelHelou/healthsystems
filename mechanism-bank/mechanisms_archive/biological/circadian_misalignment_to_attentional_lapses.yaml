  node_id: attentional_lapses
  node_name: Attentional Lapses (≥3 lapses)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: When difference between DLMO (circadian phase marker) and sleep onset is
  less than 2 hours, individuals experience severe circadian misalignment'
- 'Step 2: Severe circadian misalignment combined with sleep restriction creates double
  vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Circadian system not properly aligned with sleep-wake timing leads to impaired
  alertness systems'
- 'Step 4: Individuals are significantly more likely to have at least three attentional
  lapses the following morning'
