mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Compensated cirrhosis maintains adequate hepatic function despite architectural
  distortion'
- 'Step 2: Continued alcohol exposure, infections, or other insults exceed hepatic
  reserve capacity'
- 'Step 3: Portal hypertension develops with complications including ascites, variceal

- 'Step 4: Decompensation events occur with clinical manifestations of liver failure'
