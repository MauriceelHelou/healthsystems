direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic periodontal infection creates sustained inflammatory state with
  elevated cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP)'
- 'Step 2: Pathogenic oral bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans)
  translocate to vascular tissues'
- 'Step 3: Bacterial components and inflammatory mediators accelerate coronary atherosclerosis
  and plaque instability'
- 'Step 4: Atherosclerotic narrowing and plaque rupture lead to angina and myocardial
  infarction'
