  node_name: Thiamine Deficiency (Low TPP Levels)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption interferes with thiamine absorption in the
  gastrointestinal tract'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism increases thiamine utilization and depletion of body
  stores'
- 'Step 3: Reduced dietary intake common in AUD further depletes thiamine reserves'
- 'Step 4: Peripheral blood thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) levels decrease below normal
  range'
