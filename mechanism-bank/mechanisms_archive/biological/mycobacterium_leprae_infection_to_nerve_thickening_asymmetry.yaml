direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mycobacterium leprae bacteria preferentially invade peripheral nerve Schwann
  cells causing granulomatous inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation leads to nerve edema, fibrosis, and structural enlargement
  detectable as increased cross-sectional area on ultrasound'
- 'Step 3: Asymmetric nerve involvement develops as bacteria affect nerves in focal,
  patchy distribution rather than symmetrically'
- 'Step 4: Progressive thickening creates multiple mononeuropathy pattern with at
  least 20% of evaluated nerves showing abnormalities in household contacts'
