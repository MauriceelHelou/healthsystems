direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated BMI (average 35.4 ± 8.3 in NAFLD database; 22.70% obese in NHANES)
  leads to excess adipose tissue accumulation'
- 'Step 2: Adipose tissue dysfunction promotes insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and
  systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Metabolic dysfunction drives hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis,
  meeting MASLD diagnostic criteria (95% met MASLD criteria based on BMI alone)'

  description: 52% of NAFLD database patients and 7.28% of NHANES participants had
    type 2 diabetes, compounding metabolic dysfunction

  strength: moderate
  description: Average waist circumference of 112 ± 17 cm indicates central adiposity,
    which is more strongly associated with metabolic liver disease than peripheral
    obesity
