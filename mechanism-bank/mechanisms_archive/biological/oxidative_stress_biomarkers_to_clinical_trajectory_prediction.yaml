mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lipid peroxidation biomarkers (thiobarbituric acid products, diene conjugates,
  8-isoprostane) reflect intensity of oxidative damage'
- 'Step 2: Antioxidant-pro-oxidant status indicators quantify redox imbalance severity'
- 'Step 3: These biochemical markers can predict pathology trajectory in chronic alcoholism
  patients'
- 'Step 4: Biomarker monitoring enables assessment of treatment effectiveness and
  guides clinical decision-making'
