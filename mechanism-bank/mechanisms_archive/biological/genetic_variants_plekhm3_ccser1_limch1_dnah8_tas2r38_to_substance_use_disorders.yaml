direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inherited genetic variants in genes previously associated with SUDs (PLEKHM3,
  CCSER1, LIMCH1, DNAH8, TAS2R38) present in individuals with family history of addiction'
- 'Step 2: These variants include disruptive protein mutations that may alter neurobiological
  pathways involved in reward processing, impulse control, and substance metabolism'
- 'Step 3: TAS2R38 variants specifically affect bitter taste perception, potentially
  influencing alcohol palatability and consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative genetic burden interacts with environmental, cultural, and social
  factors to increase vulnerability to developing severe addiction profiles and polysubstance
  use'
