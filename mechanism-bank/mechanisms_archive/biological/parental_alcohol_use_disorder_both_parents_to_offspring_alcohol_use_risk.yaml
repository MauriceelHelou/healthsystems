  node_name: Risk for Alcohol Use in Offspring
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Two biological parents with alcohol use disorders create heightened familial
  risk through combined genetic liability and family environmental factors'
- 'Step 2: This dual-parent exposure leads to altered reward processing in offspring,
  specifically blunted nucleus accumbens response to reward anticipation'
- 'Step 3: Reduced reward sensitivity may create compensatory seeking of more intense
  or novel reward stimuli'
- 'Step 4: This neurobiological vulnerability increases susceptibility to alcohol
  use as a mechanism to modulate reward system functioning'
