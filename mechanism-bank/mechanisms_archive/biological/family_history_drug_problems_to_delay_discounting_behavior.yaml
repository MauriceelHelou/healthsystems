direction: 'null'
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of drug problems may indicate genetic vulnerability or household
  environmental exposures related to substance use'
- 'Step 2: These factors could theoretically affect developing neural circuits involved
  in impulse control and reward valuation'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted impulse control mechanisms could manifest as steeper delay discounting
  in offspring'
- 'Step 4: Empirical findings showed no association, with correlations between family
  history of drug problems and delay discounting ranging from ρ = -0.02 to 0.04'
