direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Abstinence from alcohol eliminates continued hepatotoxic exposure that
  drives liver inflammation and fibrosis'
- 'Step 2: Cessation of alcohol allows hepatocyte regeneration and reduction in inflammatory
  cytokines'
- 'Step 3: Liver fibrosis progression halts and may partially reverse with sustained
  abstinence'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of progression to decompensated cirrhosis and liver failure
  reduces mortality and morbidity'

  description: The benefit of abstinence is particularly pronounced at advanced fibrosis
    stages (stage 3 or beyond), where intervention has greatest impact on preventing
    progression to end-stage liver disease

  description: Sustained abstinence over time periods (1-2 years analyzed) is necessary
    for biological benefits to liver tissue
