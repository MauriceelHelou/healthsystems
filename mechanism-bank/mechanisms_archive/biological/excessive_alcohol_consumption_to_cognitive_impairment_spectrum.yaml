  node_id: cognitive_impairment_spectrum
  node_name: Alcohol-Related Cognitive Impairment Spectrum
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption causes cognitive disruption that varies by quantity,
  frequency, and duration of use'
- 'Step 2: Limited and occasional consumption produces transient and recoverable cognitive
  effects'
- 'Step 3: Heavy chronic consumption progresses through spectrum from reversible impairment
  to permanent damage'
- 'Step 4: Spectrum includes alcohol-related dementia, Wernicke encephalopathy, and
  Korsakoff syndrome as distinct but related conditions'
- 'Step 5: Common neural pathways and biochemical basis underlie these different manifestations
  of alcohol-related brain damage'
