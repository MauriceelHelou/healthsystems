  neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 2: Central nervous system becomes dependent on presence of alcohol to maintain
  homeostasis'
- 'Step 3: When alcohol consumption is reduced or stopped, neurochemical imbalance
  occurs'
- 'Step 4: Withdrawal syndrome manifests with symptoms ranging from tremors to life-threatening
