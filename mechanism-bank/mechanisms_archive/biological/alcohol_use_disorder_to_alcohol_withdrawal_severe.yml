category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic heavy alcohol use causes neuroadaptation with downregulated GABA-A receptors and upregulated
  NMDA receptors'
- 'Step 2: Abrupt cessation or reduction removes alcohol''s GABAergic inhibition while excitatory systems
  remain upregulated'
- 'Step 3: Glutamate-mediated hyperexcitability produces autonomic instability, tremor, agitation, and
  seizure risk within 6-24 hours'
- 'Step 4: In 5-10% of cases, withdrawal progresses to delirium tremens (DT) with hallucinations, disorientation,
  and severe autonomic dysfunction'
- 'Step 5: Severe DT manifests as hyperthermia, tachycardia >120, profound confusion, and can be fatal
  without benzodiazepine treatment'

  equity_implications: Severe alcohol withdrawal disproportionately affects individuals without stable
    housing, healthcare access, or social support who cannot safely detoxify. People experiencing homelessness
    cycle through untreated withdrawal in emergency departments and jails rather than receiving appropriate
    medical detoxification. The high rate of severe withdrawal in marginalized populations reflects systematic
    failures to provide accessible addiction treatment and social services, not individual choices. Policies
    that criminalize addiction and defund treatment programs directly increase severe withdrawal and associated
    mortality.
assumptions:
- Assumes abrupt cessation after sustained heavy use (>8 drinks/day for weeks to months)
- Withdrawal timeline varies by individual drinking history and metabolism
- Risk stratification assumes no prophylactic benzodiazepine treatment
limitations:
- Only 5-10% of alcohol withdrawal progresses to severe DT
- Mechanism does not account for protective effect of medical supervision and benzodiazepine protocols
- Genetic factors influencing GABA/NMDA receptor regulation create individual variability
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Severe withdrawal rates vary by access to medical detoxification facilities, harm reduction
    services, and hospital protocols
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural areas lack detoxification facilities forcing ED-based management
  - Urban safety-net hospitals concentrate uninsured severe withdrawal cases
  - States with Medicaid-funded residential detox show lower severe withdrawal mortality
  - Correctional facilities show high rates due to abrupt forced cessation without adequate medical monitoring
