direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Biofilm structure provides physical and chemical protection from environmental
  threats'
- 'Step 2: Biofilm matrix shields microorganisms from host immune system recognition
  and response'
- 'Step 3: Biofilm prevents antimicrobial agents from penetrating and reaching bacterial
  cells at therapeutic concentrations'
- 'Step 4: Protected environment allows for horizontal gene transfer and selection
  of resistance mechanisms'
- 'Step 5: Persistent biofilm communities lead to increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant
  (MDR) strains'
