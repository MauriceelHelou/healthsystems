  node_id: acoustic_startle_response

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to traumatic stress (predator odor) activates threat detection
  systems'
- 'Step 2: Stress exposure triggers heightened physiological arousal and threat sensitivity'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced acoustic startle response emerges as a marker of traumatic stress
  reactivity at day 2 post-stress'
