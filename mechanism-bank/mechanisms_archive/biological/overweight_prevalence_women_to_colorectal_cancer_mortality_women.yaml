  node_name: Colorectal Cancer Mortality (Women)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Overweight status in women increases adipose tissue which produces pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and hormones'
- 'Step 2: Excess adiposity alters estrogen metabolism and insulin signaling pathways'
- 'Step 3: Hormonal and metabolic dysregulation promotes cellular proliferation and
  inhibits apoptosis in colorectal tissue'
- 'Step 4: Chronic inflammatory state increases oxidative damage and DNA mutations
  in colon cells'
- 'Step 5: Development and progression of colorectal cancer leads to increased mortality'
