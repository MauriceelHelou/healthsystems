  node_id: wernicke_encephalopathy
  node_name: Wernicke Encephalopathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential cofactor for enzymes in glucose metabolism
  and ATP production in brain cells'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency impairs cellular energy metabolism, particularly affecting
  high-metabolic brain regions (thalamus, mammillary bodies, periaqueductal gray)'
- 'Step 3: Neuronal dysfunction and damage in these regions produces classic triad
  of confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia characteristic of Wernicke encephalopathy'
- 'Step 4: Without treatment, neuronal damage becomes irreversible leading to Korsakoff
  syndrome with persistent cognitive impairment'
