direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic insomnia combined with objectively measured short sleep duration
  (<6 hours on polysomnography) creates a biological phenotype of severe sleep disruption'
- 'Step 2: Persistent short sleep duration triggers physiological stress responses
  and metabolic dysregulation, including cardiovascular system strain'
- 'Step 3: Prolonged cardiovascular and metabolic stress increases risk for cardiometabolic
  outcomes (hypertension, diabetes)'
- 'Step 4: Accumulation of cardiovascular damage over 9+ years manifests as incident
  heart disease and/or stroke'

    identifies the biological phenotype associated with disease risk, while subjective
    self-reported sleep duration shows no association with incident CBVD
