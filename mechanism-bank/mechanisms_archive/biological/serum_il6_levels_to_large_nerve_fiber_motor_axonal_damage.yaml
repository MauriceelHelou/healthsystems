category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated serum IL-6 levels indicate systemic inflammatory state in type
  2 diabetes mellitus patients'
- 'Step 2: IL-6 induces inflammatory signaling in peripheral motor neurons'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation leads to disruption of axonal transport mechanisms
  and energy metabolism'
- 'Step 4: Motor axons undergo degeneration, resulting in reduced motor nerve conduction
  velocities and amplitudes'
