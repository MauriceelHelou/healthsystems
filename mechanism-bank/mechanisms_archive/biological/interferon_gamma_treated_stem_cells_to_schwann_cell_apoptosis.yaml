direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IFN-γ treatment enhances stem cell differentiation capacity and proliferative
  potential'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced stem cells reduce expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (caspase-3
  and Bax) in Schwann cells'
- 'Step 3: Stem cells increase expression of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2
  (BCL-2)'
- 'Step 4: Reduced apoptotic signaling leads to decreased Schwann cell death as measured
  by TUNEL staining'
