direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Paternal alcohol consumption before conception alters epigenetic programming
  in sperm cells'
- 'Step 2: Epigenetically modified sperm transmit altered developmental instructions
  to embryo at fertilization'
- 'Step 3: Modified epigenetic information disrupts normal growth regulation pathways
  throughout fetal development'
- 'Step 4: Offspring exhibit growth restriction both prenatally and postnatally, proportional
  to magnitude of paternal exposure'
