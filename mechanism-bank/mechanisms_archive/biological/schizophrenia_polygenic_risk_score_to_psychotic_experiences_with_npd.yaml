direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher schizophrenia polygenic risk score (PRS-Sz) increases genetic vulnerability
  to psychosis'
- 'Step 2: PRS-Sz is differentially associated with psychotic experiences that co-occur
  with non-psychotic disorders (PE+NPD)'
- 'Step 3: This genetic vulnerability interacts with environmental risks and NPD presence
  to create clinically significant risk states'
- 'Step 4: PE+NPD represents a more severe phenotype than PE-only, characterized by
  poor functioning and increased service use'
