direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homeostatic M2-polarized macrophages become depleted or dysfunctional'
- 'Step 2: Loss of macrophage-mediated pregnancy maintenance and fetal development
  support'
- 'Step 3: Breakdown of maternal-fetal homeostasis and increased susceptibility to
  inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Inflammatory cascade or homeostatic failure triggers preterm labor'
