mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Activated neutrophils accumulate in metastatic lung tissues'
- 'Step 2: Neutrophils release factors that modify the tumor microenvironment'
- 'Step 3: Neutrophil-derived mediators promote cancer cell survival, adhesion, and
  invasion'
- 'Step 4: The altered microenvironment facilitates establishment and growth of metastatic
  lesions'
