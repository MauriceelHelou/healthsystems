direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: 28.3% of Black adults taking antihypertensive medication have apparent
  treatment-resistant hypertension (blood pressure above goal on ≥3 medication classes
  or ≥4 classes regardless of BP)'
- 'Step 2: Treatment-resistant hypertension represents persistent elevation of blood
  pressure despite pharmacological intervention'
- 'Step 3: Sustained elevated blood pressure causes vascular damage, left ventricular
  hypertrophy, and end-organ damage'
- 'Step 4: These pathophysiological changes substantially increase cardiovascular
  disease risk including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure'
