direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to alcohol-related cues triggers viscero-afferent signals from
  the body, reflected in 0.1 Hz heart rate variability patterns'
- 'Step 2: These physiological signals are transmitted via vagal afferent pathways
  to brain regions involved in interoception and memory processing'
- 'Step 3: The coordinated brain-body interaction during cue exposure enhances the
  salience and emotional valence of alcohol-related information'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced physiological arousal during encoding strengthens memory consolidation
  specifically for alcohol cues compared to neutral or emotional stimuli'
- 'Step 5: Stronger memory traces for alcohol cues facilitate later retrieval (free
  recall) and contribute to automatic attentional biases'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The positive relationship between 0.1 Hz HRV and free recall was specific
    to participants with positive family history of AUD, suggesting genetic/familial
    vulnerability amplifies this brain-body mechanism
- name: cue_type_specificity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The effect was specific to alcohol cues rather than neutral or emotional
    cues, demonstrating specificity of the interoceptive mechanism to addiction-relevant
    stimuli
