  node_name: Response Inhibition Capacity
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes neurotoxic effects on prefrontal cortex
  and inhibitory control networks'
- 'Step 2: Alterations in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission impair executive
  function'
- 'Step 3: Reduced capacity to suppress prepotent responses and maintain behavioral
  control'
- 'Step 4: Measured as poor performance on response inhibition neuropsychological
  tasks'
