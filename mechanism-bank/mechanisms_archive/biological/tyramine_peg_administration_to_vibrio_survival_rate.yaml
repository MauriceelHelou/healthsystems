  node_id: vibrio_survival_rate

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tyramine-PEG treatment produces prolonged elevation of multiple immune
  parameters (hemocyte count, phenoloxidase, phagocytosis)'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced and extended immune activation provides sustained defense capabilities
  against bacterial pathogens'
- 'Step 3: Upon Vibrio alginolyticus challenge, shrimp with prolonged immune enhancement
  demonstrate superior pathogen clearance'
- 'Step 4: Improved pathogen clearance translates to significantly higher survival
  rates in disease susceptibility tests'
