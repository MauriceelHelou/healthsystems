- 'Step 1: Family history of alcoholism indicates genetic predisposition and/or early
  environmental exposure to alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 2: Genetic factors influence neurobiological reward pathways and vulnerability
  to alcohol-related reinforcement'

  to classification as high-risk for developing alcohol use disorder'
