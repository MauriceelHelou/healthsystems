  node_id: microcephaly_birth
  node_name: Microcephaly at Birth
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher paternal alcohol consumption before pregnancy may indicate shared
  household/family characteristics including socioeconomic factors, health behaviors,
  or genetic predispositions'
- 'Step 2: Paternal alcohol intake could potentially serve as a marker for unmeasured
  confounding factors affecting fetal development rather than direct biological effect'
- 'Step 3: The unexpected finding of stronger paternal than maternal associations
  suggests non-causal confounding rather than direct biological mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Alternative hypothesis: paternal alcohol may affect sperm quality through
  epigenetic mechanisms, though this requires replication'
