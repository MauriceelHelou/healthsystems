  node_name: Impaired Mobility and Judgment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption causes direct neurological impairment affecting
  motor control centers in cerebellum and frontal cortex'
- 'Step 2: Blood alcohol concentration above 0.08 disrupts neurotransmitter systems
  (GABA, glutamate) affecting coordination and decision-making'
- 'Step 3: Observable changes in gait patterns detected through smartphone accelerometer
  and gyroscope sensors reflect underlying neuromotor impairment'
