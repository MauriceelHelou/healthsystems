  node_name: Anterior Insula Activity During Loss Anticipation
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use alters mesocorticolimbic brain circuitry and neural
  reward processing systems'
- 'Step 2: Abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals show reduced left anterior insula
  activity during loss anticipation compared to healthy controls'
- 'Step 3: The anterior insula plays a critical role in interoceptive awareness, risk
  processing, and decision-making related to potential losses'
- 'Step 4: Reduced insula activity during loss anticipation may represent neurobiological
  changes from chronic alcohol exposure or pre-existing vulnerability factors'
