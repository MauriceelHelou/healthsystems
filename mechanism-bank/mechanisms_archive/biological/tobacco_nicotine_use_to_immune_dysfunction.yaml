  node_id: immune_dysfunction
  node_name: Immune Dysfunction
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco/nicotine use impairs immune system function through inflammatory
  and oxidative stress pathways'
- 'Step 2: Veterans and people living with HIV experience higher rates of tobacco/nicotine
  use than comparison populations'
- 'Step 3: Variable awareness of tobacco''s impacts on immune system limits protective
  action despite high awareness of smoking-related cancer risks'
