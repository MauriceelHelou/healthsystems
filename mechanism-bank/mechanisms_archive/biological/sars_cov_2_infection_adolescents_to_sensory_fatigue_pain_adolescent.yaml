direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection in adolescents aged 12-17 years triggers distinct
  pathophysiological responses affecting sensory pathways, energy metabolism, and
  pain processing systems'
- 'Step 2: Viral-induced changes to olfactory and gustatory neural pathways result
  in persistent alterations in smell and taste perception'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation manifests as chronic
  fatigue and malaise'
- 'Step 4: Multi-system pain syndromes emerge as prominent features distinguishing
  adolescent PASC presentation from younger children'

- name: age_group_specificity
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The PASC research index for adolescents specifically emphasizes change
    or loss in smell/taste, pain, and fatigue/malaise-related symptoms, distinguishing
    this age group from school-age children whose index emphasizes neurocognitive
    and gastrointestinal symptoms
- name: symptom_phenotype_clustering
  direction: modifies_presentation
  strength: moderate
  description: Adolescents showed 3 distinct PASC symptom phenotypes compared to 4
    in school-age children, with different clustering patterns reflecting age-specific
    pathophysiology
