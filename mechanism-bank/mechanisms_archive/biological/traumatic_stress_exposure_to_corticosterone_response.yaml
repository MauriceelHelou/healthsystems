to_node:
  node_id: corticosterone_response
  node_name: Corticosterone Stress Response
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Predator odor exposure activates hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
  stress response'
- 'Step 2: HPA activation triggers release of corticosterone (stress hormone)'
- 'Step 3: Elevated plasma corticosterone levels persist from immediately post-exposure
  through 60 minutes post-stress'
