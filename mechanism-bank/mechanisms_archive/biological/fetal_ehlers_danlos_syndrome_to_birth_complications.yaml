direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fetal EDS status affects multiple fetal tissue systems including connective
  tissue in vessels, membranes, and structural components'
- 'Step 2: Compromised tissue integrity increases vulnerability during labor and delivery
  processes'
- 'Step 3: Multiple pathways converge including increased PPROM, preterm birth, and
  tissue fragility during delivery'
- 'Step 4: Overall rate of birth complications differs significantly by infant EDS
  status'
