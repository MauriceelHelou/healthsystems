to_node:
  node_id: chronic_fatigue

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High variability in sleep timing and duration prevents stable recovery
  patterns and consistent restorative sleep'
- 'Step 2: Irregular sleep disrupts metabolic and neuroendocrine recovery processes
  that require consistent timing'
- 'Step 3: Unpredictable sleep creates sustained physiological stress response and
  incomplete daily energy restoration'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effects of inconsistent recovery lead to persistent fatigue
  measured by Chalder Fatigue Scale'
