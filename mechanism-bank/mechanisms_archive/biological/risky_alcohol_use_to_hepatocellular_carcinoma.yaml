- 'Step 1: Combined alcohol and HCV exposure creates chronic hepatic inflammation
  and cirrhotic environment'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced oxidative stress generates DNA damage and promotes mutagenesis
  in hepatocytes'
- 'Step 3: Cirrhotic liver provides pro-carcinogenic milieu with altered growth factor
  signaling'
- 'Step 4: Dysplastic nodules undergo malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma'
