direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher learning and memory ability at ages 9-10 years reflects enhanced
  capacity to encode and retrieve information'
- 'Step 2: Female youth with stronger learning/memory may more readily encode social
  messages about alcohol acceptability from media, peers, and family'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced memory consolidation of positive alcohol-related social cues and
  expectancies occurs'
- 'Step 4: Stored positive expectancies increase likelihood of alcohol experimentation
  by ages 13-14 years'
