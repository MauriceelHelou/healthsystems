direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-existing metabolic traits (diabetes, hypertension, obesity) create
  baseline metabolic dysfunction and inflammatory state in the liver'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure in metabolically compromised individuals produces synergistic
  hepatotoxic effects through increased oxidative stress and impaired hepatic regeneration'
- 'Step 3: Combined metabolic and alcohol-induced stress leads to earlier onset and
  more severe liver damage even with smaller quantities and shorter duration of alcohol
  exposure'
- 'Step 4: Progressive liver injury occurs more rapidly due to compounded metabolic
  and toxic insults'
