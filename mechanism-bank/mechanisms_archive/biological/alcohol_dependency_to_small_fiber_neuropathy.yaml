  node_id: small_fiber_neuropathy
  node_name: Small Fiber Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes preferential damage to unmyelinated C-fibers
  and thinly myelinated A-delta fibers'
- 'Step 2: Toxic alcohol metabolites induce mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
  stress in small nerve fibers'
- 'Step 3: Small nerve fiber degeneration occurs in skin and peripheral tissues, reducing
  intraepidermal nerve fiber density'
- 'Step 4: Loss of small nerve fibers results in impaired pain and temperature sensation
  detectable by quantitative sensory testing'
