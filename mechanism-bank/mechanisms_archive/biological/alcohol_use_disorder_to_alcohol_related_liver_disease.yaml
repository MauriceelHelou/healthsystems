direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder results in chronic, dose-dependent alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes progressive liver damage from simple steatosis
  to more severe manifestations'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol consumption leads to development of alcoholic hepatitis
  and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 4: Dose-dependent relationship results in varying severity of liver disease
  outcomes'
