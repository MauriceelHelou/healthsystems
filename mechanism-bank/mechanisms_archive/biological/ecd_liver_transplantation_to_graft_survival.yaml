direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ECD livers (despite age >60, HCV+, prolonged ischemia, or steatosis) provide
  functional hepatic tissue replacement'
- 'Step 2: Although ECD grafts show higher maximal transaminases and early allograft
  dysfunction rates, these represent transient physiologic stress'
- 'Step 3: Grafts recover sufficient function to maintain long-term viability without
  significant differences in rejection rates'
- 'Step 4: Comparable graft survival achieved between ECD and standard liver recipients
  over 5-year follow-up period'
