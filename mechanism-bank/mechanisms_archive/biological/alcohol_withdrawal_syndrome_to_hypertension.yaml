direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol use leads to neuroadaptive changes in the autonomic nervous
  system and neurotransmitter regulation'
- 'Step 2: Abrupt cessation of alcohol results in sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity
  and catecholamine surge'
- 'Step 3: Increased sympathetic tone and catecholamine release cause peripheral vasoconstriction
  and increased cardiac output'
- 'Step 4: These physiological changes manifest as elevated blood pressure during
  the withdrawal period'
