direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes multifactorial damage to brain structures
  through direct neurotoxicity, thiamine deficiency, and vascular effects'
- 'Step 2: Brain damage affects multiple cognitive domains including IQ, frontal-executive
  function, and timed visuo-spatial abilities'
- 'Step 3: Widespread cognitive impairment develops that is distinct from the specific
  memory deficits of Korsakoff syndrome'
- 'Step 4: The combined effects result in ''alcohol-related brain damage'' encompassing
  diverse cognitive deficits beyond memory'
