  node_name: Chronic Pancreatitis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes direct toxic effects on pancreatic acinar
  cells'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol metabolism produces acetaldehyde and oxidative stress, leading
  to cellular damage and inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Repeated inflammatory episodes result in morphological changes in pancreatic
  tissue'
- 'Step 4: Progressive fibrosis and structural changes develop into chronic pancreatitis
  requiring endoscopic interventions'
