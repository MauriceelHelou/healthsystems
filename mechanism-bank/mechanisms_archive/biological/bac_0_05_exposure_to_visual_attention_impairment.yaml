  node_id: visual_attention_impairment
  node_name: Forward Roadway Visual Attention
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol affects neural processing and executive function at 0.05% BAC'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive resources for divided attention and visual scanning are reduced'
- 'Step 3: At 0.10% BAC, percentage of time focused on forward roadway decreases compared
  to placebo'
- 'Step 4: Reduced forward roadway attention impairs hazard detection and response
  time in urban driving'

  description: Forward roadway attention impairment became significant at 0.10% BAC
    but not at 0.05% BAC, suggesting a threshold effect for visual attention deficits

  strength: moderate
  description: Urban driving environments require more divided attention and visual
    scanning, potentially amplifying attention impairment effects
