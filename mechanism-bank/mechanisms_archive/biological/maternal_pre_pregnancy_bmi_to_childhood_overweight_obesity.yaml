  node_name: Childhood Overweight or Obesity (Ages 1-18)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity alters intrauterine environment affecting
  fetal development'
- 'Step 2: Epigenetic modifications occur in cord blood DNA at specific CpG sites
  (14 sites show significant mediation)'
- 'Step 3: These epigenetic changes mediate between 3.99% to 25.21% of the maternal
  BMI effect on child obesity'
- 'Step 4: Modified genes affect metabolic programming, leading to increased childhood
  obesity risk across ages 1-18'
