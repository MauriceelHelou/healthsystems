  node_name: Failure of Neural Compensatory Mechanisms
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Adolescent brain initially activates compensatory neuronal mechanisms to
  maintain normal executive function performance despite alcohol-induced neurotoxicity'
- 'Step 2: Continued binge drinking over multiple years places sustained demand on
  these compensatory neural pathways'
- 'Step 3: Compensatory mechanisms lose efficacy over time with ongoing alcohol exposure,
  potentially due to neuronal exhaustion or depletion of protective reserves'
- 'Step 4: As compensation fails, observable deficits in executive function emerge,
  manifesting in older adolescents with longer drinking histories'
