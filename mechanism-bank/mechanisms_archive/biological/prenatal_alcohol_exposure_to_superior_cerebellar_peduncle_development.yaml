direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts cellular organization and myelination
  in the superior cerebellar peduncle during critical developmental windows'
- 'Step 2: Altered fractional anisotropy trajectories indicate disrupted white matter
  microstructure in this tract connecting cerebellum to midbrain and thalamus'
- 'Step 3: Abnormal maturation patterns in SCP affect motor regulation and coordination
  pathways'
- 'Step 4: These structural changes contribute to motor and learning difficulties
  characteristic of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'
