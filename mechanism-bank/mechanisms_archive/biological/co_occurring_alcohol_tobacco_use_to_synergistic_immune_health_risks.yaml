direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Concurrent alcohol and tobacco/nicotine use creates multiplicative rather
  than additive immune and cancer risks'
- 'Step 2: Low awareness of synergistic risks among users prevents understanding of
  compounded health impacts'
- 'Step 3: For people living with HIV, synergistic substance use effects compound
  existing immune dysfunction, creating heightened vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Inadequate public health messaging about co-occurring use risks perpetuates
  knowledge gaps across populations'
