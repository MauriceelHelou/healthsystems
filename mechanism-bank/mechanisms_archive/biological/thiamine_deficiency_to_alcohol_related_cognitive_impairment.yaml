direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption disrupts thiamine absorption in the gastrointestinal
  tract'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency impairs glucose metabolism in neurons, causing cellular
  energy crisis'
- 'Step 3: Neurons in memory-critical brain regions (hippocampus, mammillary bodies,
  thalamus) are particularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency'
- 'Step 4: Progressive neuronal damage manifests as cognitive impairment and dementia
  symptoms'
