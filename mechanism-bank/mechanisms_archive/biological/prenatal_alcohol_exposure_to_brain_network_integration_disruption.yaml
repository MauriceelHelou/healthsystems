direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure damages developing axonal pathways and white
  matter tracts during fetal brain development'
- 'Step 2: Impaired long-range connectivity results in less efficient communication
  pathways between distant brain regions'
- 'Step 3: Network signals must traverse more intermediate connections (longer paths)
  to reach distant brain areas'
- 'Step 4: Increased characteristic path length in adolescence/young adulthood reflects
  this inefficient global brain network integration'
