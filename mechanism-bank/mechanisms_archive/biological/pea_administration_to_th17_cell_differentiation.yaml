  node_name: Th17 Cell Differentiation
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PEA lipid mediator is administered as a therapeutic intervention'
- 'Step 2: PEA inhibits expression of master transcription factors required for Th17
  cell differentiation'
- 'Step 3: Reduced transcription factor expression prevents Th17 cell development'
- 'Step 4: Decreased Th17 cells reduces pathogenic T cell responses that cause autoimmune
  diseases'
