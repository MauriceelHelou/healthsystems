- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during critical neurodevelopmental periods in adolescence
  affects brain tissue structure'
- 'Step 2: Machine learning analysis identifies pattern of eight specific brain regions
  showing structural alterations associated with drinking history'
- 'Step 3: These morphometric patterns include both macrostructural MRI changes and
  microstructural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) alterations'
- 'Step 4: The identified neuromorphometric pattern is specific to adolescents with
  alcohol misuse history and distinguishes them from non-drinking peers'
