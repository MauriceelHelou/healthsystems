- 'Step 1: Chlorantraniliprole exposure reduces expression of key genes in the Toll
  immune pathway'
- 'Step 2: Exposure reduces expression of key genes in the IMD (Immune Deficiency)
  pathway'
- 'Step 3: Exposure reduces expression of key genes in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway'
- 'Step 4: Downregulation of these three major immune pathways leads to decreased
  production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)'
