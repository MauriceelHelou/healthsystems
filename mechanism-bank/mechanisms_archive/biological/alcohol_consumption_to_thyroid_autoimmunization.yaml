  node_name: Thyroid Autoimmunization (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption acts as an environmental trigger against background
  of genetic predispositions'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure contributes to accumulation of macrophages, dendritic
  cells, and plasma cells in thyroid tissue'
- 'Step 3: Immune dysregulation leads to decreased CD8+ T cells relative to CD4+ T
  cells'
- 'Step 4: Shift in T cell balance intensifies synthesis of pro-inflammatory Th1,
  Th17, Tfh, and Tc lymphocytes while reducing regulatory T cells (Treg)'
- 'Step 5: Pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-2, IL-12, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22,
  IFN-γ, TNF-α) increases while anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-2) decrease,
  triggering thyroid cell damage through pyroptosis and apoptosis'
