mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recurrent acute pancreatitis episodes cause repeated pancreatic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Repeated inflammatory insults lead to progressive fibrosis and structural
  damage to pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative damage results in chronic pancreatitis with permanent structural
  and functional changes'
