direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Post-release access to healthcare and HIV treatment increases medication
  adherence and viral suppression rates'
- 'Step 2: Viral suppression (HIV VL <200 copies/mL) reduces viral load in bodily
  fluids'
- 'Step 3: Lower viral loads significantly decrease the probability of HIV transmission
  during sexual contact (treatment as prevention)'
- 'Step 4: Among those engaging in unprotected sex, viral suppression provides biological
  protection against transmission'
