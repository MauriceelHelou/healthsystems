category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis parasites exhibit natural resistance to
  meglumine antimoniate (SbV), with resistance varying by zymodeme (genetic subpopulation)'
- 'Step 2: Sb-resistant parasites demonstrate higher survival rates in macrophages
  when exposed to SbV at therapeutic plasma concentrations (32 μg/mL)'
- 'Step 3: Resistant zymodeme 2.3 strains produce larger lesions and higher parasite
  burdens in host tissues compared to sensitive zymodeme 2.2 strains'
- 'Step 4: Higher parasite survival rates during treatment result in persistent infection
  and clinical treatment failure'
