direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes widespread damage to developing neural
  networks and connectivity patterns'
- 'Step 2: Disrupted axonal growth and synaptic formation reduce the efficiency of
  information transfer across the brain'
- 'Step 3: Decreased global efficiency reflects the brain''s reduced capacity to rapidly
  integrate information across functional networks'
- 'Step 4: This reduced efficiency persists into adolescence and young adulthood,
  affecting complex cognitive processing'
