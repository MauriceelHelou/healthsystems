direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy exposes the developing fetus
  to ethanol and its metabolites'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and disrupts cellular development
  in the fetal brain and other organs'
- 'Step 3: Teratogenic effects result in neurodevelopmental impairments, physical
  malformations, and behavioral deficits'
- 'Step 4: Children manifest clinical features including cognitive impairments, facial
  dysmorphology, and growth deficits characteristic of FASD'
