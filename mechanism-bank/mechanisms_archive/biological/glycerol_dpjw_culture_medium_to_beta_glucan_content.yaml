- 'Step 1: Specific carbon (glycerol) and nitrogen (DPJW) sources alter yeast metabolic
  pathways during Candida utilis cultivation'
- 'Step 2: Altered metabolic conditions promote increased synthesis and accumulation
  of β-(1,3/1,6)-glucan in cell walls'
- 'Step 3: Higher β-(1,3/1,6)-glucan content results in greater availability of immunomodulatory
  polysaccharides in yeast biomass'
