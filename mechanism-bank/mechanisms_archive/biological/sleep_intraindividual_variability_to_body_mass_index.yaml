mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Variable sleep patterns disrupt circadian regulation of metabolic hormones
  including leptin, ghrelin, and cortisol'
- 'Step 2: Irregular sleep timing alters glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity
  through disrupted circadian metabolic processes'
- 'Step 3: Sleep variability impacts appetite regulation and eating patterns through
  hormonal dysregulation'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative metabolic disruption from inconsistent sleep-wake cycles contributes
  to weight gain and higher BMI'
