direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with underlying alcohol-related liver disease continue high alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 2: Continued alcohol exposure on damaged liver tissue triggers acute-on-chronic
  inflammatory cascade'
- 'Step 3: Severe hepatic inflammation develops as alcohol-related hepatitis'
- 'Step 4: This represents a life-threatening condition with high short-term mortality
  rate'
