direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe hypercalcemia causes cardiac arrhythmias, neurological dysfunction,
  and acute kidney injury'
- 'Step 2: Acute pancreatitis triggers systemic inflammatory response with potential
  for multi-organ failure'
- 'Step 3: Underlying malignancy contributes to immunosuppression and poor physiologic
  reserve'
- 'Step 4: Combined metabolic crisis, pancreatic complications (necrosis, infection),
  and cancer burden lead to death'
