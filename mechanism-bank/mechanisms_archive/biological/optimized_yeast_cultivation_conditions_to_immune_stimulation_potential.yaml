mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Appropriate cultivation conditions (specific carbon and nitrogen sources)
  optimize β-(1,3/1,6)-glucan content and epitope exposure'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced β-glucan surface accessibility allows recognition by immune system
  pattern recognition receptors'
- 'Step 3: Immune system activation through β-glucan recognition triggers innate immune
  responses'
- 'Step 4: Strengthened immune function reduces susceptibility to infections and need
  for antibiotic therapy'
