to_node:
  node_id: poor_impulse_control
  node_name: Poor Impulse Control
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Blunted physiological stress responses (cortisol and heart rate) reflect
  altered central nervous system regulation'
- 'Step 2: Dysregulated stress response systems affect prefrontal cortex function
  and executive control'
- 'Step 3: Reduced stress reactivity impairs behavioral self-regulation mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Poor impulse control emerges as behavioral manifestation of stress system
  dysregulation'
