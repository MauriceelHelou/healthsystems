direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-risk alcohol use causes direct neurotoxic effects on peripheral and
  central nervous systems'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure alters neurological, endocrinological, and pain
  processing systems'
- 'Step 3: Neurological damage and dysregulation of pain pathways lead to development
  of chronic pain conditions'
- 'Step 4: Similar patterns between alcohol dependence and chronic pain suggest shared
  neurobiological mechanisms'
