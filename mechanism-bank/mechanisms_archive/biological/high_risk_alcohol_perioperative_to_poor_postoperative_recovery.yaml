direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-risk alcohol consumption in weeks before surgery impairs immune function
  and wound healing capacity'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol affects coagulation, cardiovascular stability, and metabolic processes
  during surgical stress'
- 'Step 3: Perioperative alcohol use increases risk of complications including infections,
  bleeding, and delayed healing'
- 'Step 4: Continued postoperative alcohol consumption compounds recovery risks and
  prolongs rehabilitation period'
