  node_id: neurodevelopmental_impairment_risk
  node_name: Neurodevelopmental Impairment Risk
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated myo-inositol indicates ongoing glial reactivity and neuroinflammatory
  processes in developing brain'
- 'Step 2: Neuroinflammation disrupts normal white matter maturation and myelination
  processes critical for cognitive development'
- 'Step 3: White matter alterations impair neural connectivity and information processing
  speed'
- 'Step 4: Disrupted brain development manifests as impaired neurodevelopment during
  first years of life'
