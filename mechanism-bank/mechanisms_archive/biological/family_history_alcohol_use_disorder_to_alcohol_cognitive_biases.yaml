  node_name: Alcohol Cognitive Biases (Enhanced Memory for Alcohol Cues)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with positive family history of AUD (FHP) have inherited genetic
  and neurobiological vulnerabilities that alter interoceptive signaling systems'
- 'Step 2: When exposed to alcohol, these individuals show increased viscero-afferent
  reactivity (measured as 0.1 Hz heart rate variability) specifically to alcohol-related
  cues'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced interoceptive signals from the body during alcohol exposure become
  mapped onto cognitive processing systems in the brain'
- 'Step 4: This brain-body coordination strengthens memory encoding and retrieval
  for alcohol cues, as evidenced by improved free recall performance'
- 'Step 5: The strengthened cognitive bias for alcohol cues increases incentive salience
  and vulnerability to alcohol use disorder development'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The relationship between interoceptive signals (0.1 Hz HRV) and memory
    for alcohol cues was only observed in FHP participants who received actual alcohol
    beverage, not placebo or control conditions
- name: subjective_intoxication
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Increased ratings of subjective intoxication dampened the relationship
    between physiological responses and cognitive biases, suggesting that conscious
    perception of bodily states may modulate the automatic incentive salience processes
