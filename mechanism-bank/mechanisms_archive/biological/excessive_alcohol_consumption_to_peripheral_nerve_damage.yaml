  node_id: peripheral_nerve_damage
  node_name: Peripheral Nerve Damage
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption causes direct neurotoxic effects on peripheral
  nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure leads to microstructural changes in nerve tissue detectable
  by increased T2-relaxation times and proton spin density'
- 'Step 3: These microstructural alterations manifest as measurable increases in nerve
  cross-sectional area and T2-weighted signal intensity'
- 'Step 4: Progressive nerve damage follows a proximal-to-distal gradient along peripheral
  nerves from thigh to tibiotalar joint'
