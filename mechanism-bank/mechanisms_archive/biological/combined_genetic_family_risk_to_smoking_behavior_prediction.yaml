direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Polygenic risk scores capture molecular genetic liability through direct
  DNA variation'
- 'Step 2: Family history captures both shared genetic factors and environmental exposures
  within families'
- 'Step 3: The partial overlap indicates common genetic transmission while distinct
  components reflect environmental factors not captured by current PRS'
- 'Step 4: Combining both measures provides more comprehensive assessment of total
  risk from genetic and familial environmental sources'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced prediction allows better identification of high-risk populations
  for targeted prevention'
