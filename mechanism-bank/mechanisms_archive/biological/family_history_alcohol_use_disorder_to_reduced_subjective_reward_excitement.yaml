direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic and familial risk for AUD creates neurobiological alterations in
  reward processing systems'
- 'Step 2: These neural alterations manifest in both objective brain activation patterns
  and subjective emotional experiences'
- 'Step 3: Family history-positive individuals report significantly less excitement
  when anticipating monetary rewards ($5 gain vs $0 gain)'
- 'Step 4: Diminished subjective reward response parallels neural findings and may
  contribute to seeking more intense rewarding stimuli like alcohol'
