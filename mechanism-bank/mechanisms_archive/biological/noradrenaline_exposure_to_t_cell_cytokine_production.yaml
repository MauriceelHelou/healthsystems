direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stress-induced noradrenaline is released and circulates systemically'
- 'Step 2: Noradrenaline binds to β2-AR on CD4+ T cells'
- 'Step 3: β2-AR activation alters intracellular signaling pathways in T cells'
- 'Step 4: Altered signaling modifies cytokine production profile, impairing anti-chlamydial
  immune response'
