to_node:

direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoking exposure induces specific methylation changes at CpG site
  cg17823346 in the ZMIZ1 gene region'
- 'Step 2: Increased methylation at this site modulates ZMIZ1 gene expression and
  associated regulatory pathways'
- 'Step 3: ZMIZ1-mediated biological processes provide protective cellular functions
  against carcinogenic transformation'
- 'Step 4: Genetically predicted higher methylation at this site reduces colorectal
  cancer susceptibility'
