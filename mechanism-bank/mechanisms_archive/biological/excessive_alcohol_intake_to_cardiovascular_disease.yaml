direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Excessive alcohol consumption leads to increased blood pressure through
  activation of sympathetic nervous system and disruption of vascular regulation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol intake causes direct myocardial toxicity and cardiomyopathy'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol consumption promotes dyslipidemia and metabolic dysregulation'
- 'Step 4: These biological changes accumulate to increase risk of coronary heart
  disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions'

  description: Adults with vision impairment have both higher prevalence of excessive
    alcohol intake (aPR=1.29) and higher prevalence of CVD (aPR=1.65), suggesting
    compounding vulnerabilities in this population
