category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute ischemic stroke causes neurological damage through cerebral infarction
  and disruption of neural circuits'
- 'Step 2: Damage to specific brain regions (prefrontal cortex, limbic system, basal
  ganglia) disrupts neurotransmitter systems and emotional regulation pathways'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological disruption manifests as clinical psychiatric symptoms including
  mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders'
- 'Step 4: Early post-stroke period (first week) represents acute phase of neuropsychiatric
  manifestation'
