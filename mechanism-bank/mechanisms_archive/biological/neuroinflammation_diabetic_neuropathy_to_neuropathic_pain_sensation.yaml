  node_id: neuropathic_pain_sensation
  node_name: Impaired Tactile and Thermal Pain Sensation
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and chemokines (CXCL1,
  CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10) promote nerve tissue inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation triggers Schwann cell apoptosis and nerve fiber degeneration'
- 'Step 3: Damaged nerve fibers result in impaired sensory signal transmission'
- 'Step 4: Loss of nerve function manifests as reduced tactile sensation (measured
  by Von Frey) and thermal pain sensation (measured by hot disc tester)'
