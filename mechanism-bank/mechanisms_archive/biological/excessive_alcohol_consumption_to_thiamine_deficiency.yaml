  node_id: thiamine_deficiency
  node_name: Thiamine Deficiency
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption creates strong reinforcing conditions that deplete
  thiamine levels in the body'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficit becomes the main biochemical determinant factor affecting
  brain metabolism'
- 'Step 3: Severe thiamine deficiency initiates cascade of irreversible brain damaging
  events'
- 'Step 4: Nutritional deficiency combines with direct alcohol neurotoxicity to compound
  brain damage'
