direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption during first trimester directly exposes the
  developing fetus to alcohol through placental transfer'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure during critical periods of brain development could potentially
  affect neurological growth'
- 'Step 3: However, no consistent pattern of association was found with continuous
  head circumference measures in this study'
