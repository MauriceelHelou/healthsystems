  node_id: head_neck_cancer_risk
  node_name: Head and Neck Cancer Risk
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol makes direct contact with oral and pharyngeal mucosa, causing chronic
  irritation and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde produced by oral microbiota and salivary glands reaches high
  concentrations in oral cavity'
- 'Step 3: DNA adducts form in epithelial cells of mouth, throat, and larynx, leading
  to mutations'
- 'Step 4: Sustained carcinogenic exposure and impaired immune surveillance increase
  risk of squamous cell carcinoma in head and neck region'
