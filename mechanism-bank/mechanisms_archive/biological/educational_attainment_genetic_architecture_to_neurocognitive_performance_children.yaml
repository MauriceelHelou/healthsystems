direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Polygenic scores derived from genome-wide association studies (1.1 million
  individuals for educational attainment) capture genetic variants associated with
  cognitive and educational trajectories'
- 'Step 2: These genetic architectures influence neurodevelopmental processes that
  support cognitive performance during childhood and adolescence'
- 'Step 3: In the context of environmental opportunities, these genetic propensities
  manifest as measurable differences in neurocognitive performance'
- 'Step 4: The predictive power is stronger for crystallized measures, indicating
  gene-environment interplay where environmental factors mediate genetic potential'
