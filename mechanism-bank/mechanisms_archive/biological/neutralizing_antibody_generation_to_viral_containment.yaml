direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children develop adaptive immune responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection
  or vaccination'
- 'Step 2: B cells produce neutralizing antibodies specific to viral spike proteins'
- 'Step 3: Neutralizing antibodies bind to virus and prevent cellular entry'
- 'Step 4: Viral replication is controlled, reducing disease severity and transmission'
