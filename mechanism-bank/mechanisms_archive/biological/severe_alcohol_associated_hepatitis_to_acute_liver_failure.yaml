category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis causes extensive hepatocyte injury
  and necrosis'
- 'Step 2: Progressive liver dysfunction develops with declining synthetic function'
- 'Step 3: Rapid deterioration leads to acute-on-chronic liver failure'
- 'Step 4: Without transplantation or clinical trial intervention, mortality risk
  increases substantially'
