to_node:
  node_id: mesocorticolimbic_reward_processing
  node_name: Mesocorticolimbic Reward Processing
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic factors transmitted through families create neurobiological vulnerabilities
  in reward processing systems'
- 'Step 2: First-degree relatives inherit genetic variants that may alter dopaminergic
  signaling and mesocorticolimbic function'
- 'Step 3: These inherited neural processing differences affect how individuals respond
  to rewards, losses, and potentially substance-related cues'
- 'Step 4: Altered reward processing may increase susceptibility to alcohol dependence
  when combined with environmental risk factors (availability, stress, trauma)'
