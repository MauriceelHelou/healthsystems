direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Persistent severe vomiting for extended period (1 month) prevents oral
  nutrition intake and absorption'
- 'Step 2: Inability to consume and retain food depletes thiamine stores (body stores
  only support 18 days without intake)'
- 'Step 3: Pregnancy increases metabolic demands and thiamine requirements for fetal
  development'
- 'Step 4: Combined effect of increased demand and zero intake creates severe thiamine
  deficiency state'
