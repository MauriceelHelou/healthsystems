direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure causes structural brain alterations including
  increased cerebral and regional volume'
- 'Step 2: Atypical brain structure affects neural circuitry function and information
  processing'
- 'Step 3: Altered neural function manifests as psychological and behavioral symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Brain structure differences partially mediate relationships between prenatal
  exposure and outcomes at baseline and 1-year follow-up'
