direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early liver transplant with shorter abstinence period (<6 months) results
  in higher rates of post-transplant alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Return to alcohol consumption causes progressive hepatocellular injury
  and inflammation in transplanted liver'
- 'Step 3: Continued harmful alcohol use leads to development of steatosis, hepatitis,
  and fibrosis in graft'
- 'Step 4: Advanced alcohol-related graft injury progresses to decompensated cirrhosis
  with ascites, variceal bleeding, or hepatic encephalopathy'
