  node_name: Hormone Receptor Negative Breast Cancer (ER-/PR-)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: PFOA disrupts cellular pathways independent of classical hormone receptor
  signaling'
- 'Step 2: Widespread environmental contamination from industrial sources leads to
  population-level exposure through water and food'
- 'Step 3: PFOA may affect oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage pathways'
- 'Step 4: Non-hormonal carcinogenic mechanisms promote hormone receptor-negative
  tumor development'

  description: PFOA showed positive associations specifically with ER-, PR-, ER+/PR-,
    and ER-/PR- tumors in upper quartiles, suggesting distinct mechanism from PFOS
    that operates independent of hormone receptor pathways
