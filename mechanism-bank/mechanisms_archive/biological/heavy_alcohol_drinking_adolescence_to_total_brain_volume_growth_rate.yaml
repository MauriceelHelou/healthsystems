direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure during critical neurodevelopmental period (late
  adolescence to young adulthood, 3.5-7.5 years in macaque model, equivalent to human
  adolescence)'
- 'Step 2: Daily ethanol consumption (22 hours/day access) creates sustained neurotoxic
  environment during active brain remodeling phase'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-induced neurotoxicity disrupts normal developmental processes of
  brain growth and maturation'
- 'Step 4: Dose-dependent reduction in rate of brain volume expansion compared to
  age-matched controls'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative attenuation of brain growth results in reduced overall brain
  volume trajectory over 12-month exposure period'
