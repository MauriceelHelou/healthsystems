  node_id: sensory_impairment
  node_name: Sensory Impairment
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-induced peripheral nerve damage disrupts sensory signal transmission
  from periphery to central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Loss of both large fibers (affecting vibration, proprioception) and small
  fibers (affecting pain, temperature) impairs multiple sensory modalities'
- 'Step 3: Reduced nerve fiber function results in elevated sensory detection thresholds'
- 'Step 4: Quantitative sensory testing reveals statistically significant deficits
  in sensory perception compared to healthy controls'
