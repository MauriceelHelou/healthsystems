  node_name: Integral Redox State Imbalance
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Polytrauma independently generates pronounced oxidative stress through
  tissue injury, hypoxia, and inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome adds reactive oxygen species generation and
  antioxidant depletion'
- 'Step 3: Combined pathology creates more pronounced violations of integral redox
  state than either condition alone'
- 'Step 4: Synergistic oxidative damage affects multiple organ systems requiring intensive
  management'

    redox imbalance, though effects persist through day 7
