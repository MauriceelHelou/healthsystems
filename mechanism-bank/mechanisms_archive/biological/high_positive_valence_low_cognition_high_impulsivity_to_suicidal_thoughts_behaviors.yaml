  node_name: High Positive Valence with Low Cognition (High Impulsivity)
to_node:
  node_id: suicidal_thoughts_behaviors
  node_name: Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High reward responsivity in positive valence systems at ages 9-10 creates
  heightened sensitivity to reward and emotional stimuli'
- 'Step 2: Low cognitive functioning reduces capacity for emotion regulation, impulse
  control, and adaptive coping'
- 'Step 3: High impulsivity combined with low cognitive control increases vulnerability
  to dysregulated responses to stress and negative experiences'
- 'Step 4: By ages 11-12, this neural profile predicts increased risk for suicidal
  ideation and suicide attempts'
