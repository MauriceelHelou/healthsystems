direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Light to moderate alcohol consumption (approximately 1-2 drinks/day) in
  women produces vasodilatory effects'
- 'Step 2: Moderate alcohol may improve endothelial function and reduce vascular resistance'
- 'Step 3: These physiological changes reduce blood pressure development risk'
- 'Step 4: J-shaped relationship observed where moderate consumption is protective
  against hypertension development'
