direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cold-induced stress activates the sympathetic nervous system, increasing
  noradrenaline release'
- 'Step 2: Noradrenaline binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors (β2-AR) on immune cells'
- 'Step 3: β2-AR signaling modulates immune response, altering cytokine production
  and T cell function'
- 'Step 4: Impaired immune function increases susceptibility to C. muridarum genital
  infection and higher pathogen load'
