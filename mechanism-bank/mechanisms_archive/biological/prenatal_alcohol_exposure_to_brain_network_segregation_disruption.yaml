direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure during critical periods of fetal brain development
  disrupts neuronal migration and organization'
- 'Step 2: These early disruptions alter the formation of local functional brain networks
  and connections between neighboring brain regions'
- 'Step 3: Altered network formation leads to decreased clustering coefficient, indicating
  reduced functional segregation of brain networks'
- 'Step 4: Reduced segregation persists into adolescence and young adulthood, affecting
  specialized information processing in local brain regions'
