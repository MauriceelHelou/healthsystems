- 'Step 1: Environmental allergen exposure (often housing-related) triggers upper airway inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Rhinitis represents systemic allergic response affecting entire respiratory tract'
- 'Step 3: Upper and lower airway inflammation are interconnected through shared immune pathways'
- 'Step 4: Chronic upper airway inflammation sensitizes lower airways to additional triggers'
- 'Step 5: Progression from rhinitis to asthma through unified airway inflammatory cascade'

description: Rhinitis presence is associated with increased asthma prevalence, representing interconnected
  respiratory tract inflammatory responses to environmental exposures, often originating from housing
  conditions.
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: While rhinitis appears as a biological mechanism, its root causes often trace to
    structural environmental exposures including housing quality, occupational hazards, and neighborhood
    air quality. The 'unified airway' concept links upper and lower respiratory inflammation, suggesting
    that structural factors creating rhinitis also contribute to asthma through shared pathways. Environmental
    justice concerns arise when certain populations face disproportionate allergen exposures.
