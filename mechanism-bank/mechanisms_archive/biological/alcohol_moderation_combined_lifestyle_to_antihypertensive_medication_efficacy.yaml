direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol moderation combined with other lifestyle modifications (weight
  loss, sodium reduction, physical activity) creates additive physiological effects
  on blood pressure regulation'
- 'Step 2: These lifestyle changes improve insulin sensitivity, reduce sympathetic
  nervous system activity, and enhance endothelial function'
- 'Step 3: Improved baseline vascular function allows antihypertensive medications
  to work more effectively through their target mechanisms (diuresis, ACE inhibition,
  calcium channel blockade)'
- 'Step 4: Synergistic effects between lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy
  result in greater BP reductions than either intervention alone'
