  node_id: withdrawal_syndrome
  node_name: GHB Withdrawal Syndrome
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular GHB use creates neuroadaptation in central nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Abrupt discontinuation disrupts adapted neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 3: Withdrawal syndrome manifests with patterns similar to alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 4: Clinical presentation may be difficult to distinguish from other withdrawal
  syndromes, especially when toxicological testing is unavailable or negative'
