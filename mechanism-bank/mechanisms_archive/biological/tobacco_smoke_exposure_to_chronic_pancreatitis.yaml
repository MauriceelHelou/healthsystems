to_node:
  node_id: chronic_pancreatitis
  node_name: Chronic Pancreatitis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains multiple toxic compounds that enter systemic circulation
  and reach pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Tobacco toxins directly damage pancreatic cells and promote oxidative stress
  and inflammation'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure leads to progressive pancreatic fibrosis and loss of function'
- 'Step 4: Tobacco exposure may interact synergistically with other risk factors including
  alcohol and genetic susceptibilities'
