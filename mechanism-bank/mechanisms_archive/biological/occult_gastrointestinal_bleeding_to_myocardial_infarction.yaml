to_node:
  node_id: myocardial_infarction
  node_name: Myocardial Infarction
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Occult gastrointestinal bleeding reflects ongoing microscopic blood loss
  into the digestive tract'
- 'Step 2: Chronic blood loss causes iron deficiency, reducing hemoglobin levels and
  oxygen delivery to cardiac tissue'
- 'Step 3: Occult bleeding may indicate systemic vascular inflammation, endothelial
  dysfunction, or shared atherosclerotic processes'
- 'Step 4: These pathophysiological changes increase myocardial oxygen demand-supply
  mismatch and thrombotic tendency, raising myocardial infarction risk'
