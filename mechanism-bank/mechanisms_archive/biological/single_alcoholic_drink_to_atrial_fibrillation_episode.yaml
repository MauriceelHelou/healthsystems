to_node:
  node_id: atrial_fibrillation_episode
  node_name: Atrial Fibrillation Episode
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Consumption of one alcoholic drink leads to measurable blood alcohol levels
  within hours'
- 'Step 2: Even moderate alcohol exposure affects cardiac autonomic tone and electrophysiology'
- 'Step 3: Acute changes in sympathetic/parasympathetic balance alter atrial refractoriness'
- 'Step 4: These transient electrophysiological changes trigger AF episode in susceptible
  individuals'
