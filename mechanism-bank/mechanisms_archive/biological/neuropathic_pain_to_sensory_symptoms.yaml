direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peripheral or central nervous system damage alters pain processing pathways'
- 'Step 2: Nerve injury sensitizes pain receptors and neural circuits'
- 'Step 3: Thermal allodynia develops (pain from normally non-painful temperature
  stimuli)'
- 'Step 4: Mechanical hyperalgesia develops (exaggerated pain response to pressure)'
