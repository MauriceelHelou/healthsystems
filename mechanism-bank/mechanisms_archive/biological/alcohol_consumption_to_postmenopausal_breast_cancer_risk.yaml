to_node:
  node_id: postmenopausal_breast_cancer_risk
  node_name: Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Risk
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption increases circulating estrogen levels through enhanced
  aromatization of androgens'
- 'Step 2: Acetaldehyde, a carcinogenic metabolite of alcohol, causes DNA damage and
  impairs DNA repair mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-induced oxidative stress and inflammation promote cellular proliferation
  in breast tissue'
- 'Step 4: These biological processes accumulate over time, increasing risk of malignant
  transformation in postmenopausal breast tissue'
