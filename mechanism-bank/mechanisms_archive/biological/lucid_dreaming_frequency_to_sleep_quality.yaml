direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lucid dreaming frequency is associated with increased nightmare frequency'
- 'Step 2: Nightmares disrupt sleep architecture and continuity through arousal responses'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted sleep patterns lead to poor overall sleep quality'
- 'Step 4: The apparent direct effect of lucid dreaming on sleep quality is fully
  mediated by nightmare frequency'
