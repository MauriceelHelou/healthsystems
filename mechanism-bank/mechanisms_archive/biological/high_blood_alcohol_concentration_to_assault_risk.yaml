- 'Step 1: Elevated blood alcohol concentration impairs cognitive function, judgment,
  and impulse control'
- 'Step 2: Late-night drinking produces strongly increased mean estimated BAC levels'

  and victimization risk'
- 'Step 4: Assault peaks at 3-5am coincide with highest BAC levels and late-night
  public congregation'
