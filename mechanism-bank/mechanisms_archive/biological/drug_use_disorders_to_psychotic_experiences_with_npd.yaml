direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Drug use disorders represent a non-psychotic disorder (NPD) context in
  which psychotic experiences emerge'
- 'Step 2: Drug use disorders co-occur with attenuated psychotic symptoms creating
  a PE+NPD state'
- 'Step 3: This combination state (PE+NPD) is characterized by poor functioning and
  increased health service use'
- 'Step 4: PE+NPD represents approximately one-third of total yearly incidence of
  psychotic experiences'
