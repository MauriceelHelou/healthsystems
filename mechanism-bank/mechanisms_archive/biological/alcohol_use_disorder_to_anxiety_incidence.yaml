  node_id: anxiety_incidence
  node_name: Anxiety Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption disrupts GABA and glutamate neurotransmitter
  systems that regulate anxiety and stress response'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol withdrawal states create hyperarousal and anxiety symptoms due
  to central nervous system adaptations'
- 'Step 3: Type 2 diabetes diagnosis introduces additional health-related stress and
  uncertainty for individuals with AUD'
- 'Step 4: Combined disease burden, neurobiological vulnerability, and pre-existing
  mental health conditions increase risk of anxiety disorders'

    from 2.08 to 1.48, showing that pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities partially
    mediate the AUD-anxiety relationship
