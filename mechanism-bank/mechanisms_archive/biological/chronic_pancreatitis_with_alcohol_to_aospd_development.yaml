direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic pancreatitis causes structural changes including pancreatic duct
  dilation and stone formation, creating mechanical obstruction'
- 'Step 2: Pancreatic duct obstruction leads to stasis of pancreatic secretions behind
  the blockage'
- 'Step 3: Stagnant pancreatic juice provides ideal environment for bacterial colonization
  and infection'
- 'Step 4: Bacterial infection in obstructed pancreatic ducts produces suppurative
  inflammation, resulting in AOSPD with characteristic fever, elevated inflammatory
  markers, and positive pancreatic juice cultures'

  description: History of pancreaticobiliary intervention was more prevalent in AOSPD
    with CP patients, potentially introducing bacterial contamination or causing additional
    duct trauma
- name: smoking
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Smoking history was more prevalent in AOSPD with CP patients, potentially
    through immunosuppressive effects or synergistic pancreatic damage with alcohol
- name: pancreatic_stones
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Presence of pancreatic stones creates mechanical obstruction necessary
    for development of suppurative infection
