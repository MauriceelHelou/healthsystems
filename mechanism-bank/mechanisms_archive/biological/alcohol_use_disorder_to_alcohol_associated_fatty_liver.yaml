  node_id: alcohol_associated_fatty_liver
  node_name: Alcohol-Associated Fatty Liver
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption in AUD populations disrupts hepatic lipid metabolism
  through increased NADH/NAD+ ratio'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced fatty acid synthesis and decreased fatty acid oxidation lead to
  triglyceride accumulation'
- 'Step 3: Hepatic steatosis develops as the earliest manifestation of alcohol-associated
  liver disease'
- 'Step 4: High prevalence of fatty liver observed in AUD populations represents initial
  stage of alcohol-related hepatic injury'
