- 'Step 1: Weekly outpatient support groups provide structured social environment
  for individuals in recovery following rehabilitation discharge'
- 'Step 2: Regular group meetings create accountability structures and peer support
  networks that reinforce abstinence and recovery behaviors'

  connection to therapeutic resources during vulnerable post-rehabilitation period'
- 'Step 4: Social support from peers with shared recovery experiences reduces isolation
  and provides modeling of successful recovery strategies'
