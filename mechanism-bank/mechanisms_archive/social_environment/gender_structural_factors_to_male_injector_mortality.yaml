mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gender norms and structural factors shape patterns of drug use, risk-taking
  behaviors, and help-seeking among men who inject drugs'
- 'Step 2: Men may face barriers to accessing treatment services due to masculinity
  norms that discourage help-seeking or vulnerability'
- 'Step 3: Gendered pathways into homelessness and unstable housing may differ, with
  men representing majority of visible street homelessness'
- 'Step 4: Drug use environments and social networks may be differently structured
  by gender, affecting overdose risk and bystander intervention capacity'
