direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Television alcohol advertisements reach young adolescents through unrestricted
  commercial media channels, creating repeated exposure to alcohol marketing messages'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to alcohol advertising normalizes drinking behavior and creates
  positive associations with alcohol consumption among youth who have not yet initiated
  drinking'
- 'Step 3: Marketing messages increase perceived social acceptability and desirability
  of alcohol use in early adolescence'
- 'Step 4: Youth without prior drinking experience are particularly vulnerable to
  initiating alcohol use following advertising exposure due to lack of established
  resistance or negative associations'

  description: Television advertising primarily affects drinking initiation among
    those without prior childhood drinking experience. The mechanism operates differently
    for youth who have already initiated alcohol use.
