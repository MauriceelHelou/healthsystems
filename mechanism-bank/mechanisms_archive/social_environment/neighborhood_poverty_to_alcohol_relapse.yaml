direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhood poverty concentrates social and economic stressors that limit
  recovery resources'
- 'Step 2: Poverty-affected neighborhoods have fewer treatment facilities, recovery
  support services, and prosocial activities'
- 'Step 3: Economic strain and limited opportunities increase psychological distress
  and undermine motivation for sustained sobriety'
- 'Step 4: These combined structural disadvantages increase likelihood of relapse
  trajectory versus stable recovery'
