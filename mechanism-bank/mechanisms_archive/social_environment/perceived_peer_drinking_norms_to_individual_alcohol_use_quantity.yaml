mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students form beliefs about how much their peers typically drink'
- 'Step 2: Perceived quantity norms create social expectations and standards for acceptable
  drinking amounts'
- 'Step 3: Students calibrate their own drinking quantity to match perceived peer
  standards'
- 'Step 4: Higher perceived peer drinking quantity norms lead to increased individual
  alcohol consumption quantity'
