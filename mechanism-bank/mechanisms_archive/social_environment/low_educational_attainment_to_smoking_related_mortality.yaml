direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower educational attainment is associated with higher smoking initiation
  rates due to targeted marketing in disadvantaged communities and limited access
  to smoking cessation resources'
- 'Step 2: Educational inequality creates differential stress exposure and coping
  mechanisms, with smoking used as a stress response to structural disadvantage'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to healthcare and smoking cessation programs among lower
  educated groups reduces quit rates and increases long-term exposure'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged tobacco exposure leads to increased risk of smoking-related diseases
  and mortality'
