- 'Step 1: College students identify their closest, most proximal peers within their
  immediate social network'
- 'Step 2: Students observe and form perceptions about the drinking behaviors of these
  personally identified peers'
- 'Step 3: These peer perceptions create social norms within the egocentric network
  that normalize specific levels of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Students adjust their own drinking behavior to align with perceived drinking
  patterns of their closest social contacts'
