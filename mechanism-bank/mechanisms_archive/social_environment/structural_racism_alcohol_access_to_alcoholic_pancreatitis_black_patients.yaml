direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Targeted alcohol marketing and higher density of alcohol outlets in predominantly
  Black neighborhoods increases alcohol exposure and availability'
- 'Step 2: Historical policies including redlining and ongoing economic marginalization
  concentrate poverty and limit economic alternatives in Black communities'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from racial discrimination and economic precarity increases
  risk for alcohol use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of chronic heavy alcohol consumption lead to increased incidence
  of alcoholic acute pancreatitis requiring hospitalization in Black populations'
