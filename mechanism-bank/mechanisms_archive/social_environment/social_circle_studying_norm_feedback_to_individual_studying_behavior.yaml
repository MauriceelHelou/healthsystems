  node_id: individual_studying_behavior

direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students receive specific feedback about the actual distribution of studying
  time within their clearly defined social circle'
- 'Step 2: This feedback reveals that peers study more than students had estimated,
  creating awareness of higher-than-expected academic norms'
- 'Step 3: Students increase their own studying time in response to this feedback,
  possibly through normative pressure or modeling'
- 'Step 4: Notably, this behavioral change occurred without clear effects on estimation
  accuracy, suggesting the feedback operated through mechanisms other than cognitive
  correction'
