direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social, situational, and location contexts shift throughout evening hours
  as adolescents move between settings'
- 'Step 2: These dynamic changes create varying levels of alcohol availability, supervision,
  and peer influence across time points'
- 'Step 3: Temporal variation in contextual risk factors produces both concurrent
  and lagged effects on drinking likelihood at different evening time points'
