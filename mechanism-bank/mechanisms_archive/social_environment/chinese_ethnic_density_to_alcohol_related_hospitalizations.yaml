direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher concentrations of co-ethnic residents create stronger social networks
  and cultural norms that discourage excessive alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Ethnic density provides social cohesion and informal social control mechanisms
  that regulate alcohol use behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Cultural institutions and community support systems in ethnically dense
  areas reinforce protective cultural values regarding alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Reduced social isolation and enhanced community belonging decrease stress-related
  alcohol use as coping mechanism'
