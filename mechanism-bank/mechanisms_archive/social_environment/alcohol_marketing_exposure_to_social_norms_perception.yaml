  node_name: Perceptions of Social Norms Around Alcohol
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol marketing saturates youth environments with images depicting alcohol
  use as normative and desirable'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure shapes youth perceptions of others'' behaviors and attitudes
  toward alcohol (descriptive and injunctive norms)'
- 'Step 3: Youth develop inflated estimates of peer drinking prevalence and acceptability
  based on marketing portrayals'
- 'Step 4: These altered social norm perceptions drive drinking initiation and maintenance
  to conform to perceived peer standards'
