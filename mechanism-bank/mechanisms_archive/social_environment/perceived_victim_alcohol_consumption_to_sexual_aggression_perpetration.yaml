direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social norms and rape myths associate women''s alcohol consumption with
  sexual availability and reduced credibility'
- 'Step 2: Perception that a woman is drinking activates cognitive scripts that minimize
  perceived harm and accountability for aggression'
- 'Step 3: Among intoxicated men with high MGRS, perception of victim intoxication
  provides justification and perceived opportunity for sexual aggression'
- 'Step 4: Drinking concordance creates a social context where aggression is seen
  as more acceptable or less punishable'
