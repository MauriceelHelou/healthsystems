direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus environment lacks integrated programming addressing negative affect
  management and eating behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Female college students experience negative emotions without institutional
  support for adaptive coping'
- 'Step 3: Students with high negative urgency use eating behaviors (binge eating
  or food restriction) as maladaptive coping mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Absence of early intervention programs allows disordered eating patterns
  to develop and persist'

    and restrictive eating; students with this trait are most vulnerable to institutional
    gaps in coping support
