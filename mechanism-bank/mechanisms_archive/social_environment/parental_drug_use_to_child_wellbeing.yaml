mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parental drug use creates particularly severe disruptions to family system
  functioning, often involving legal consequences, criminalization, and social marginalization'
- 'Step 2: Drug use may involve more chaotic patterns of availability, housing instability,
  and involvement with criminal justice systems that further destabilize family environment'
- 'Step 3: Children experience compounded adversity from both direct effects of impaired
  parenting and indirect effects of drug-related social and legal consequences'
- 'Step 4: Multiple, intersecting sources of family instability produce stronger longitudinal
  effects on child developmental outcomes'
