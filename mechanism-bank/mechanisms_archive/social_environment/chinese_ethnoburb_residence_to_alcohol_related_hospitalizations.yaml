direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Suburban spatial design disperses population across wider geographic areas,
  reducing frequency of face-to-face community interactions and informal social monitoring'
- 'Step 2: Greater socioeconomic advantage and English fluency in ethnoburbs facilitates
  acculturation to mainstream American drinking cultures and increased exposure to
  alcohol marketing'
- 'Step 3: Car-dependent suburban infrastructure reduces walkability and community
  cohesion, weakening social ties that provide protective norms'
- 'Step 4: Socioeconomic mobility and integration may disrupt traditional cultural
  norms and reduce participation in ethnic community institutions that reinforce alcohol
  protective values'

  description: Despite lower poverty rates in ethnoburbs (p<0.001), residents experience
    more alcohol-related problems than enclave residents, suggesting socioeconomic
    advantage paradoxically reduces protective effects

  description: Suburban built environment with lower density, car-dependency, and
    dispersed settlement patterns weakens community cohesion that protects against
    alcohol harm
