mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social stigma creates fear of judgment and social consequences for pregnant
  women with substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Fear of stigma acts as a barrier preventing women from disclosing substance
  use to healthcare providers'
- 'Step 3: Non-disclosure and avoidance of healthcare settings reduces access to substance
  use disorder treatment'
- 'Step 4: Lack of treatment access results in continued maternal exposure and increased
  risk of adverse neonatal effects'
