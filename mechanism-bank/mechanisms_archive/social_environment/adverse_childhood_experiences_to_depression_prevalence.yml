mechanism_pathway:
  - "Step 1: ACEs (abuse, neglect, household dysfunction) create toxic stress during critical developmental periods"
  - "Step 2: Toxic stress alters brain development including prefrontal cortex and limbic system"
  - "Step 3: HPA axis programming leads to dysregulated cortisol response and chronic stress reactivity"
  - "Step 4: Epigenetic changes affect gene expression related to stress response and mood regulation"
  - "Step 5: Disrupted attachment patterns impair emotional regulation and interpersonal relationships"
  - "Step 6: Cognitive schemas developed in adversity (helplessness, negative self-view) persist into adulthood"
  - "Step 7: Cumulative biological and psychological vulnerability manifests as adult depressive disorders"

  sample_size: 500000
  interpretation: "Adults with 1+ ACE have 2.75-fold increased odds of depression compared to those without ACEs. Umbrella reviews confirm 2-fold risk (OR 2.01). Strong dose-response relationship exists - risk increases with each additional ACE. Specific ACE types show varying effects: physical/sexual abuse strongest (OR 5.66), domestic violence exposure also high (OR 4.13)."

description: "Adverse childhood experiences strongly predict adult depression with dose-response relationship. Meta-analysis of 62 prospective longitudinal studies from 15 countries shows 2.75-fold increased depression odds. Specific ACE types including abuse and domestic violence exposure show particularly strong effects. Multiple pathways including neurobiological, psychological, and social mechanisms link childhood adversity to adult depression."

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: institutional
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: "ACEs are not randomly distributed but concentrated in communities facing poverty, racism, and historical trauma. Child abuse and neglect reflect failures of social safety nets, inadequate family support services, and intergenerational trauma from structural violence. Prevention requires addressing root causes: economic security, housing stability, substance use treatment access, and community-based family support. Individual therapy alone cannot address structural determinants of childhood adversity."
assumptions:
  - "ACEs measured retrospectively via validated questionnaires (CDC-Kaiser or similar)"
  - "Depression measured via validated diagnostic instruments"
  - "Prospective studies establish temporal ordering despite retrospective ACE measurement"
limitations:
  - "Retrospective ACE measurement subject to recall bias"
  - "Potential for reverse causation (current depression affecting ACE recall)"
  - "Difficult to isolate specific ACE types due to co-occurrence"
  - "Majority of studies from high-income countries (US, Europe)"
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: "Studies from 15 countries show consistent effects. ACE prevalence varies by community based on poverty, social services, and historical factors. Effects may vary by cultural context and available mental health services."
  relevant_geographies:
    - "US (original ACE study and most replications)"
    - "Effects consistent across high-income countries"
    - "Limited data from low/middle-income countries"
