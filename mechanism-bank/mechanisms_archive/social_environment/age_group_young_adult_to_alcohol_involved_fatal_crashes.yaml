category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults (21-30 years) face structural conditions including social
  norms around alcohol consumption, nightlife culture, and peer influence'
- 'Step 2: This age group has developmental characteristics including higher risk-taking
  behavior and incomplete frontal lobe maturation affecting judgment'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to alternative transportation infrastructure (public transit,
  ride-sharing subsidies) particularly affects younger adults with lower incomes'
- 'Step 4: Combination of alcohol consumption patterns and driving exposure in this
  age group increases crash risk'
- 'Step 5: Young adults show statistically significant overrepresentation among inebriated
  fatally injured drivers'
