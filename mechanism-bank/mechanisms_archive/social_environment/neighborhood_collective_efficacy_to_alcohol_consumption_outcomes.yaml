- 'Step 2: Higher collective efficacy hypothesized to provide informal social control
  and community resources'

  description: In Puerto Rico's cultural context, collective efficacy did not mediate
    neighborhood disadvantage effects on alcohol outcomes, suggesting family cohesion
    or social support may be more salient than neighborhood-level collective efficacy
