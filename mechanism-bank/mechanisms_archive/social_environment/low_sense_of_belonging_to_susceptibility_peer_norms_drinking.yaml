direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students with lower sense of belonging experience unmet needs for social
  connection and acceptance within the college environment'
- 'Step 2: These students become more motivated to gain social approval and avoid
  social exclusion to establish belonging'
- 'Step 3: Students pay greater attention to and are more influenced by perceived
  peer norms as signals for how to gain acceptance'
- 'Step 4: This heightened susceptibility leads to stronger conformity to perceived
  drinking norms as a strategy to achieve social integration'
