direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal and institutional stigma portrays agonist medications (buprenorphine,
  methadone) as ''replacing one drug with another'''
- 'Step 2: Court personnel hold more negative attitudes toward agonist medications
  compared to antagonist medications (naltrexone)'
- 'Step 3: Stigma-based attitudes influence judicial decisions to restrict or deny
  agonist MAT referrals'
- 'Step 4: Reduced agonist MAT prescribing limits access to most effective OUD pharmacotherapy,
  worsening treatment outcomes'
