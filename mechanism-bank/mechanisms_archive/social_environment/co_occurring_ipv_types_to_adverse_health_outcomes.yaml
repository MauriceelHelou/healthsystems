direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple types of IPV (physical, psychological, sexual) create cumulative
  trauma exposure across different domains of victimization'
- 'Step 2: Co-occurrence of IPV types compounds physiological stress response systems
  and depletes psychological coping resources'
- 'Step 3: Poly-victimization overwhelms natural resilience factors and support systems,
  creating chronic allostatic load'
- 'Step 4: Sustained exposure to multiple violence types manifests in both mental
  health problems (PTSD, depression) and physical health sequelae through neuroendocrine
  and immune dysregulation'
