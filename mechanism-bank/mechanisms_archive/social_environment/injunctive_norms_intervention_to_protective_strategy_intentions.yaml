direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Injunctive norms intervention conveys information about peer approval for
  using protective strategies during drinking games'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to intervention increases perceived injunctive norms (perceptions
  of peer approval for protective strategy use)'
- 'Step 3: Heightened perceptions of peer approval mediate the relationship, creating
  stronger intentions to use protective strategies'
- 'Step 4: Increased intentions may translate to actual protective behaviors that
  reduce alcohol consumption and negative consequences'
