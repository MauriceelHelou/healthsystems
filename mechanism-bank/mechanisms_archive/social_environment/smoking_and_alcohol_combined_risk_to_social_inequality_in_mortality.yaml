  node_name: Social Inequality in Mortality
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic stratification creates differential exposure to modifiable
  risk factors through neighborhood conditions, workplace hazards, and commercial
  targeting'
- 'Step 2: Smoking and harmful alcohol consumption cluster among disadvantaged groups
  due to shared structural determinants including chronic stress, limited resources,
  and reduced access to cessation/treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Synergistic effects of tobacco and alcohol increase disease risk beyond
  individual effects, with both representing embodied consequences of structural inequality'
- 'Step 4: Mortality inequality widens as health-promoting policies and interventions
  are more accessible to higher socioeconomic groups, creating inverse equity effects'
