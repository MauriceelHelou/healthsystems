mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Phencyclidine availability in Houston increases between 2014 and 2018'
- 'Step 2: PCP detection in DWI/DUID cases rises from fifth-most common drug in 2014
  to second-most common in 2018'
- 'Step 3: By 2018, PCP is detected in 20% of cases requiring drug analysis'
- 'Step 4: Increased PCP-impaired driving contributes to traffic safety threat and
  potential for severe crashes given drug''s dissociative effects'
