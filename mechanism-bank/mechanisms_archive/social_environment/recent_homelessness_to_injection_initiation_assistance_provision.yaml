direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates unstable living conditions and lack of private space,
  increasing exposure to public drug use networks and social contexts where injection
  occurs'
- 'Step 2: Housing instability increases social marginalization and embeds individuals
  more deeply within street-based drug using communities where initiation assistance
  is more likely to occur'
- 'Step 3: Homeless individuals may congregate in locations where drug use occurs
  openly, increasing opportunities for newer users to seek initiation assistance from
  experienced injectors'
- 'Step 4: Economic and social vulnerabilities associated with homelessness may create
  social dynamics where experienced users are positioned to assist others in initiation'

  description: The relationship between homelessness and injection initiation assistance
    provision was stronger in Tijuana (66% increased odds) compared to Vancouver (47%
    increased odds), suggesting that local contextual factors such as housing policy,
    drug policy enforcement, and harm reduction infrastructure may modify this relationship
