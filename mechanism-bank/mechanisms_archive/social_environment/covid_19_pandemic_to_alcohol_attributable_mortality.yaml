direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates crisis conditions including social isolation,
  economic stress, and disrupted routine services'
- 'Step 2: Crisis conditions lead to polarization in drinking patterns - heaviest
  drinkers increase consumption despite overall population decrease'
- 'Step 3: Increased heavy drinking among high-risk drinkers leads to more severe
  alcohol-related health consequences'
- 'Step 4: Elevated rates of alcohol-related organ damage, alcohol poisoning, and
  other fully attributable conditions result in increased mortality'
