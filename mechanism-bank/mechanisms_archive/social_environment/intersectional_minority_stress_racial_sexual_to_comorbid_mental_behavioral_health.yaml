mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black and Latino sexual minority men face structural discrimination from
  both racism and heterosexism'
- 'Step 2: Intersecting forms of structural stigma create compounded minority stress
  exposure'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure to multiple forms of discrimination increases allostatic
  load and stress-related pathology'
- 'Step 4: Elevated minority stress manifests as higher rates of depression, anxiety,
  substance use, and HIV risk behaviors'
- 'Step 5: This creates greater baseline comorbidity burden in racially/ethnically
  minoritized sexual minority populations'

  description: Treatment specifically targeting minority stress processes is particularly
    effective for those experiencing intersectional minority stress. The moderation
    coefficient (B=-3.23) indicates that racial/ethnic minority identification strongly
    predicts differential treatment response.
