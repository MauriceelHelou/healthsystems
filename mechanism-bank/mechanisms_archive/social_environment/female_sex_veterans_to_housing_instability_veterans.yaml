direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Women veterans may have different social support networks or family structures
  that provide housing stability'
- 'Step 2: Gender-specific barriers to accessing veteran services or military culture
  may reduce women''s identification as veterans and thus screening positive'
- 'Step 3: Women veterans may experience different forms of housing precarity that
  are less likely to be captured by standard screening tools'
- 'Step 4: Potential measurement bias where women veterans underreport housing instability
  due to stigma or safety concerns'
