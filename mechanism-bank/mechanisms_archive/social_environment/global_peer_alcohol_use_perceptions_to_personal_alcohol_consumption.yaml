direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students form generalized perceptions about alcohol use by the
  ''typical student'' on campus'
- 'Step 2: These global perceptions create broad social norms about acceptable drinking
  behavior in the college environment'
- 'Step 3: Students reference these generalized norms when making decisions about
  their own alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: However, these global perceptions have weaker influence than egocentric
  network perceptions because they are less proximal to actual social interactions'
