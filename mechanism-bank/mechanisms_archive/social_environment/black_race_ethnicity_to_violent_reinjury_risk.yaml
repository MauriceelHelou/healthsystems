mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism and residential segregation concentrate Black populations
  in neighborhoods with limited economic opportunities and resources'
- 'Step 2: These communities experience disproportionate exposure to violence and
  chronic stressors due to disinvestment, policing practices, and lack of social services'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to violence intervention programs, mental health services,
  and trauma-informed care following initial injury'
- 'Step 4: Elevated risk of re-exposure to violent situations in the same communities
  where structural factors maintain cycles of violence'
