category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students occupy different positions within peer network structures based
  on peer nominations (indegree centrality)'
- 'Step 2: Students with lower indegree centrality have fewer peer connections and
  less secure social standing'
- 'Step 3: Lower centrality creates vulnerability and motivation to conform to group
  norms to improve social position'
- 'Step 4: At timepoints when students have relatively lower indegree centrality,
  they more closely adhere to perceived team drinking norms'
- 'Step 5: Higher centrality students have more secure positions and are less susceptible
  to normative pressures'
