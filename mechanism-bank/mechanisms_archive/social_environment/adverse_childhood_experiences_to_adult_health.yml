- 'Step 4: ACE-related trauma often leads to health risk behaviors (smoking, substance use, poor diet)'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative biological and behavioral effects manifest as chronic disease, disability, and premature
  mortality'

description: Adverse childhood experiences are strongly associated with adult health conditions including
  anxiety, depression, arthritis, asthma, cancer, COPD, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke.
  An estimated 63% of US adults have at least one ACE, with 22% having 4+ ACEs. The economic burden of
  ACE-associated health conditions is $14.1 trillion annually, or $88,000 per affected adult.

  equity_implications: ACE prevalence varies 2-3 fold across communities and is concentrated in populations
    facing poverty, racism, and historical trauma. ACEs are not random individual events but reflect structural
    violence, inadequate social safety nets, and intergenerational trauma. Prevention requires addressing
    root causes including economic security, housing stability, and community resources.
assumptions:
- ACEs measured using CDC-Kaiser ACE questionnaire or similar validated tool
- Health conditions include both physical and mental health outcomes
- Lifetime per-person burden based on value of statistical life methodology
limitations:
- Retrospective ACE measurement subject to recall bias
- Difficult to establish causation vs. shared underlying factors
- Does not account for positive childhood experiences that may buffer effects
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: ACE prevalence and associated health burden vary substantially by state and community,
    driven by poverty concentration and social determinants.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Lifetime economic burden per affected adult ranges from $1.3M (North Dakota) to $4.3M (Arkansas)
  - Communities with high poverty show elevated ACE prevalence
  - States with stronger social safety nets show lower ACE rates
