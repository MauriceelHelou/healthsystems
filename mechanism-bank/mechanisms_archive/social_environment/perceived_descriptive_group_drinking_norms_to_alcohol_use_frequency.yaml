direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students form perceptions about how much their proximal peer group (club
  sport team members) drinks alcohol'
- 'Step 2: These descriptive norms (perceived typical drinking behaviors) are strongly
  associated with individual drinking patterns at the between-person level, showing
  stable trait-like associations'
- 'Step 3: Within-person analysis reveals strong contemporaneous associations at each
  timepoint, indicating that changes in perceived descriptive norms co-occur with
  changes in drinking frequency'
- 'Step 4: No prospective within-person associations were found, suggesting that descriptive
  norms do not predict future drinking behavior through conformity mechanisms when
  disentangling within- and between-person effects'

  description: Proximal social groups (club sport teams) provide a distinct context
    where peer norms may be particularly salient due to team cohesion and frequent
    interaction

  direction: strengthens

  description: Strong contemporaneous associations at each timepoint suggest that
    descriptive norms and drinking co-vary together rather than operating through
    temporal conformity processes
