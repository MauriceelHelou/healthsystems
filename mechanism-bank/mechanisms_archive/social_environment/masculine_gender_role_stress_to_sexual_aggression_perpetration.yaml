direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal norms and expectations around masculine gender roles create psychological
  stress when men perceive threats to their masculine identity'
- 'Step 2: Higher masculine gender role stress increases vulnerability to engaging
  in aggressive behaviors when social contexts provide perceived justification or
  opportunity'
- 'Step 3: When combined with acute alcohol intoxication, cognitive inhibition is
  reduced and adherence to rigid masculine scripts intensifies'
- 'Step 4: In drinking contexts where both perpetrator and victim are intoxicated,
  men with high MGRS perceive reduced accountability and increased opportunity for
  sexual aggression'
