direction: 'null'
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Attitudes toward mental illness measured by MICA scale capture both personal
  stigma and professional attitudes about mental health conditions'
- 'Step 2: Theoretical expectation is that higher stigma would create barriers to
  help-seeking through internalized shame and fear of judgment'
- 'Step 3: However, in this study, total MICA score was not significantly associated
  with help-seeking from mental health professionals'
- 'Step 4: This suggests that structural barriers (symptom severity, substance use
  history, professional consequences) may override individual attitudes in determining
  help-seeking behavior'
