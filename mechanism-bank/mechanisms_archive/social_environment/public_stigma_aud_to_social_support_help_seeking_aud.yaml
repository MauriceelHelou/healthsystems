direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public stigma creates negative attitudes and beliefs about individuals
  with alcohol use disorder in the general population'
- 'Step 2: Higher stigma reduces willingness of community members to provide active
  support to those with AUD seeking treatment'
- 'Step 3: Reduced social support from others creates barriers to treatment-seeking
  behavior'
- 'Step 4: Lower treatment-seeking rates result in untreated AUD and poorer health
  outcomes'
