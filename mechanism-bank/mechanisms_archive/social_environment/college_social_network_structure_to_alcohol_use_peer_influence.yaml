category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College institutional structures (residential arrangements, Greek life,
  academic programs) organize students into specific social network configurations'
- 'Step 2: These network structures determine which peers have proximal contact with
  individual students'
- 'Step 3: Network composition creates differential exposure to alcohol use norms
  based on the drinking behaviors of network members'
- 'Step 4: Egocentric network structure mediates the strength of peer influence on
  individual alcohol consumption patterns'
