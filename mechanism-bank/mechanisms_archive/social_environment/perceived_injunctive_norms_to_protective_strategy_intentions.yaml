direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students form perceptions about whether peers approve of using
  protective strategies during drinking games'
- 'Step 2: Higher perceived peer approval creates social permission and reduces perceived
  social costs of using protective behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Reduced perceived social barriers and increased normative alignment strengthen
  intentions to engage in protective behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Stronger intentions may lead to actual protective strategy use, reducing
  alcohol-related harm'
