direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhood poverty concentration creates differential social environments
  and exposure pathways for adolescent boys and girls'
- 'Step 2: High-poverty neighborhoods may have structural features (alcohol outlet
  density, social disorder, limited supervision) that affect adolescent substance
  use risks'
- 'Step 3: Gender-specific social roles, peer networks, and mobility patterns within
  neighborhoods create differential vulnerability or protection from substance use
  risks'
- 'Step 4: Relocation from high to low-poverty neighborhoods alters these gendered
  exposures in opposite directions for boys versus girls'

  strength: strong
  description: Gender fundamentally moderates the relationship between neighborhood
    poverty and adolescent binge drinking, with treatment-gender interaction P=0.002.
    The effect of moving to low-poverty neighborhoods is protective for girls (OR=0.48)
    but harmful for boys (OR=2.37), demonstrating opposite directional effects.
- name: treatment_compliance
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Instrumental variable analysis adjusting for treatment compliance showed
    results comparable to intention-to-treat but with larger effect sizes, suggesting
    actual neighborhood mobility strengthens the gender-differentiated effects beyond
    simple treatment assignment.
