mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol intoxication affects cognitive assessment and judgment in social
  drinking contexts'
- 'Step 2: Impaired judgment reduces ability to accurately assess risk and danger
  in observed interactions'
- 'Step 3: Decreased risk perception leads to lower recognition of need for intervention
  in potentially harmful situations'
- 'Step 4: Reduced perceived need for intervention decreases likelihood of taking
  personal responsibility for action'
