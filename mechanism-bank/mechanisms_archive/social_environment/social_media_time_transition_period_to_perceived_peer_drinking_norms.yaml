direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: During the transition to college, students lack established peer networks
  and rely more heavily on social media for information about peer behavior'
- 'Step 2: Social media platforms disproportionately showcase alcohol-related content
  due to its salience and shareability in college culture'
- 'Step 3: Limited real-world reference points during transition period make social
  media portrayals more influential in shaping normative beliefs'
- 'Step 4: Students develop inflated perceptions of how much and how often same-sex
  peers drink based on biased social media exposure'
