mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Availability of unrecorded alcohol provides access to cheaper alcoholic
  beverages outside regulated channels'
- 'Step 2: Lower cost per unit enables consumption of larger quantities without increased
  financial burden'
- 'Step 3: Unrecorded alcohol often has uncertain alcohol content and fewer quality
  controls, facilitating unpredictable consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Increased availability enables and sustains high-risk drinking behaviors,
  particularly among those already engaged in risky consumption'

  description: High-risk drinkers show 24.2% unrecorded alcohol use compared to 6.5%
    among low-risk and 13.6% among medium-risk drinkers, suggesting availability disproportionately
    affects those with existing risky patterns
