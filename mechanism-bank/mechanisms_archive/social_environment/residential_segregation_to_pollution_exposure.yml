  segregated residential patterns'
- 'Step 2: Segregated neighborhoods of color were disproportionately zoned for industrial
  use and highway placement'
- 'Step 3: Lower property values and political power in segregated areas enabled
  continued polluting facility siting'
- 'Step 4: Residents of segregated neighborhoods face elevated exposure to air pollution,
  traffic emissions, and industrial toxics'
- 'Step 5: Pollution exposure disparities persist across generations as housing patterns
  remain segregated'

    description: Isolation and dissimilarity indices predict pollution exposure at

  interpretation: Residential segregation creates persistent pollution exposure disparities,
    with Black and Latino populations exposed to over 50% more PM2.5 than they generate
    while white populations are exposed to 17% less

description: Residential racial segregation creates systematic disparities in environmental
  pollution exposure. Black and Latino Americans are exposed to 56% more PM2.5 pollution
  than they generate through consumption, while white Americans are exposed to 17%
  less. This disparity persists despite overall air quality improvements and reflects
  historical patterns of discriminatory zoning, redlining, and industrial facility
  siting in segregated communities of color.

structural_competency:
  root_cause_level: systemic_racism
  avoids_victim_blaming: true
  equity_implications: Pollution exposure disparities are a direct consequence of
    structural racism in housing, zoning, and land use policy. Solutions require
    addressing root causes including residential integration, environmental justice
    enforcement, pollution reduction at source, and reparative investment in overburdened
    communities rather than expecting individuals to move or filter their air.
assumptions:
- Segregation measured via residential isolation and dissimilarity indices
- Pollution exposure from EPA monitoring and modeling data
- Consumption-based attribution assigns pollution to end consumers of goods
limitations:
- Aggregate data may mask within-group variation
- Causality difficult to establish from cross-sectional patterns
- Some disparity may reflect income/wealth rather than race directly
- Historical context cannot be fully captured in contemporary data
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Segregation and pollution patterns vary by metro area, region,
    and historical development patterns.
  relevant_geographies:
  - Industrial Midwest cities show strong segregation-pollution links
  - California shows cumulative environmental burden disparities
  - Southern cities show historical redlining-pollution correlations
