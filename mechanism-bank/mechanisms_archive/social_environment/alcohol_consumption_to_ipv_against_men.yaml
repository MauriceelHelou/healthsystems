direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption impairs cognitive function and reduces inhibition in
  the perpetrator'
- 'Step 2: Reduced inhibition lowers threshold for expressing anger and frustration
  within intimate relationships'
- 'Step 3: Economic stress from alcohol expenditure creates additional relationship
  conflict'
- 'Step 4: Disinhibited state combined with relationship tension triggers physical,
  emotional, or verbal violence against male partners'
