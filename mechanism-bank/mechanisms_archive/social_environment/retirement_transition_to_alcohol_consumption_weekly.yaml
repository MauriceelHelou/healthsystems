direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Retirement removes work-based constraints and natural inhibitors of alcohol
  consumption (work schedules, professional obligations, workplace norms)'
- 'Step 2: Changes to everyday routines, roles, and habits create temporal and social
  space for increased drinking'
- 'Step 3: Removal of structured work environment eliminates regular monitoring and
  accountability structures that previously moderated alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Increased leisure time and reduced role obligations provide more opportunities
  for alcohol consumption'
