direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black college students perceive drinking behaviors of other Black students
  at their university as normative reference for their own behavior'
- 'Step 2: These race-concordant descriptive norms provide stronger social modeling
  effects than general college student norms for Black students'
- 'Step 3: Perception of higher drinking among same-race peers at same institution
  creates social acceptance and expectation of drinking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Students adjust their own alcohol consumption upward to align with perceived
  norms of their racial peer group at their specific university'
