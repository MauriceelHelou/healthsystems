description: Tobacco smoking during adolescence in future fathers creates epigenetic modifications in
  germline cells that increase asthma risk in their future offspring through intergenerational transmission
  of environmental damage.

  equity_implications: 'This mechanism reflects how structural tobacco accessibility (policy failures
    in youth tobacco control, marketing targeting) creates intergenerational health inequities. Youth
    tobacco use is shaped by availability, pricing, and social determinants, not individual choice. Equity
    implication: Communities with greater tobacco industry targeting experience higher rates of youth
    smoking and subsequent intergenerational respiratory health burdens.'
