direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: GHB becomes increasingly popular in specific subpopulations including clubbers
  and men who have sex with men (MSM)'
- 'Step 2: Recreational use in these social contexts increases risk of repeated exposure
  and escalating use patterns'
- 'Step 3: Regular GHB use leads to neuroadaptation and physiological dependence'
- 'Step 4: Dependence manifests as severe withdrawal syndrome including hallucinations
  and delirium upon cessation'
