mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Children with FASD experience neurocognitive delays affecting attention,
  executive function, memory, and learning capacity'
- 'Step 2: These cognitive impairments create challenges in meeting standard academic
  expectations and classroom behavioral norms'
- 'Step 3: Without appropriate identification and accommodation, children struggle
  to participate successfully in school activities'
- 'Step 4: Lack of educator knowledge and resources to support FASD students leads
  to misunderstanding, inappropriate discipline, and inadequate support'
- 'Step 5: This results in disrupted school experiences including academic failure,
  behavioral problems, and potential exclusion from education'
