direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth engage in multiple forms of internet alcohol marketing (seeing ads,
  visiting brand websites, becoming online fans, recalling brand imagery), indicating
  high receptivity'
- 'Step 2: Multiple touchpoints with alcohol marketing create stronger brand loyalty,
  deeper normalization of drinking, and more positive alcohol expectancies'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced engagement with marketing content strengthens intentions to consume
  alcohol and reduces perceived harm'
- 'Step 4: High receptivity translates into initiation of binge drinking behavior
  at rates higher than those with lower receptivity'
