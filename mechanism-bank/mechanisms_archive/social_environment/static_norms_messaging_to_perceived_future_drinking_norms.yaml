mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Static norms messaging presents current drinking levels without trajectory
  information'
- 'Step 2: In the absence of information about changing norms, students default to
  expectation that current patterns will continue or increase'
- 'Step 3: Students extrapolate from stable current norms to anticipate higher or
  unchanged future drinking levels'
- 'Step 4: Perceived future drinking norms increase or remain elevated compared to
  dynamic norms condition'
