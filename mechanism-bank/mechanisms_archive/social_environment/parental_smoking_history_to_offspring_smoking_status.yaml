to_node:

  node_name: Offspring Smoking Status
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Parental smoking creates household exposure to tobacco use through both
  environmental tobacco smoke and social modeling'
- 'Step 2: Children in smoking households experience normalized smoking behavior and
  reduced perception of health risks'
- 'Step 3: Parental smoking may indicate lower socioeconomic status and higher neighborhood
  tobacco outlet density due to targeted marketing'
- 'Step 4: These combined environmental exposures increase likelihood of offspring
  smoking initiation and maintenance'
- 'Step 5: Family history effects operate partially independently from genetic transmission,
  indicating distinct environmental pathways'

  description: PRS and family history show partial overlap but also distinct additive
    effects, suggesting both genetic and environmental transmission operate simultaneously
    and may interact
