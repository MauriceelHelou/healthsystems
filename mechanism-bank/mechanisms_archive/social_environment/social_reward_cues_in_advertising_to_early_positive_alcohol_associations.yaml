  emphasize social and reward cues'
- 'Step 2: Adolescent brains are developmentally primed to be particularly responsive
  to social and reward stimuli'
- 'Step 3: Exposure to these targeted cues during adolescence promotes the formation
  of positive associations with alcohol early in life'
- 'Step 4: These early positive associations motivate social drinking behaviors and
  establish alcohol as a socially rewarding substance'
