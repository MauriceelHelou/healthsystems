category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic creates conditions of home confinement and social isolation
  for older adults'
- 'Step 2: Increased time in home environments elevates exposure to multiple simultaneous
  injury mechanisms (falls down stairs, falls combined with assault)'
- 'Step 3: Social isolation reduces immediate assistance availability, potentially
  worsening injury severity when incidents occur'
- 'Step 4: Higher proportion of trauma cases involve multiple injury sites or mechanisms
  requiring emergency department care'
