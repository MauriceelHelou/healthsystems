mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transition from high school to college represents a major life course restructuring
  of social environments and institutional contexts'
- 'Step 2: This transition disrupts existing peer networks and creates opportunities
  for new peer network formation'
- 'Step 3: College environments typically have different alcohol availability, social
  norms, and regulatory contexts than high school settings'
- 'Step 4: These structural changes produce shifts in perceived peer drinking norms,
  with some students experiencing increasing norms, others declining norms, and others
  maintaining stable norms'
