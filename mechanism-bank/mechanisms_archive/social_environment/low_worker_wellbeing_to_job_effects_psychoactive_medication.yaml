category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low worker well-being reflects exposure to workplace stressors, poor working
  conditions, job insecurity, or inadequate mental health support'
- 'Step 2: Workers with low well-being are more likely to use psychoactive medications
  (potentially including non-medical use) to manage distress and maintain functioning'
- 'Step 3: Medication effects (sedation, cognitive impairment, or inappropriate use
  patterns) interfere with job performance, leading to adverse workplace consequences'
