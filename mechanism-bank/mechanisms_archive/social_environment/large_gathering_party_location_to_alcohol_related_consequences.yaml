direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Large gathering/party settings create high-density social environments
  with reduced supervision and monitoring compared to commercial establishments'
- 'Step 2: These settings establish social contexts where heavy drinking is normalized
  and expected through peer modeling and social pressure'
- 'Step 3: Students perceive higher descriptive norms (peers experience more consequences)
  and injunctive norms (peers approve of consequences) in these locations'
- 'Step 4: The combination of normative perceptions, reduced environmental controls,
  and social expectations leads to increased alcohol consumption and associated negative
  consequences'
