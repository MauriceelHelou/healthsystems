- 'Step 1: Structural inequities create conditions of poverty, housing instability,
  unemployment, and social marginalization'
- 'Step 2: Limited economic opportunities and social exclusion increase exposure to
  drug markets and substances as coping mechanisms'

  high structural inequities'
- 'Step 4: Untreated substance use disorders lead to behaviors resulting in criminal
  justice involvement and incarceration'
