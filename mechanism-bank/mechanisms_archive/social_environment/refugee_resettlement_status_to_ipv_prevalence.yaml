direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Refugee status entails forced migration with associated trauma, loss of
  social networks, and disruption of protective community structures'
- 'Step 2: Post-migration context creates multiple structural challenges including
  economic instability, language barriers, social isolation, and uncertain legal status'
- 'Step 3: These compounded structural vulnerabilities increase risk factors for IPV
  including economic dependency, limited access to support systems, and reduced capacity
  for help-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers intersect with cultural contexts and power imbalances
  in resettlement, elevating IPV risk to approximately one-third of refugee women'
