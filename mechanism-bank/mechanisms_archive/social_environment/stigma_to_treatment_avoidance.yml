mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal stigma frames addiction as moral failing and character weakness rather than medical
  condition'
- 'Step 2: Internalized stigma and shame create reluctance to disclose drinking problems or seek help'
- 'Step 3: Fear of social consequences (job loss, child custody, criminal justice involvement) delays
  treatment seeking'
- 'Step 4: Stigma in healthcare settings produces judgmental provider interactions and punitive rather
  than therapeutic approaches'
- 'Step 5: Negative treatment experiences and ongoing stigma lead to dropout, with average time from problem
  recognition to treatment seeking of 8-10 years'

  equity_implications: 'Addiction stigma is not natural but socially constructed and maintained through
    institutional practices. Media representations, punitive drug policies, and medical training perpetuate
    moral framing. Stigma operates as social control, especially targeting marginalized communities where
    substance use is criminalized rather than medicalized. The white middle class accesses private compassionate
    treatment while communities of color face criminalization for the same behaviors. Criminal records
    from addiction create permanent stigma blocking employment and housing. Health insurance discrimination
    makes addiction treatment less accessible than other medical care. High treatment dropout reflects
    systemic creation and maintenance of stigma, not individual shame. Reducing stigma requires policy
    transformation: decriminalization, parity enforcement, anti-discrimination laws, medical education
    reform, and media accountability.'
assumptions:
- Stigma encompasses public attitudes, self-stigma, and structural discrimination
- Treatment avoidance includes both never seeking care and early dropout
- Mechanism operates through psychological (shame) and practical (discrimination) barriers
limitations:
- Other barriers (cost, access, childcare) also contribute to treatment avoidance
- Stigma levels vary across cultures and communities
- Some individuals seek treatment despite stigma; protective factors matter
spatial_variation:
  varies_by_geography: true
  variation_notes: Stigma and treatment avoidance vary by community norms, healthcare culture, and criminalization
    approaches
  relevant_geographies:
  - Rural and conservative communities often have stronger addiction stigma and lower treatment utilization
  - Areas with harm reduction services and drug decriminalization show reduced stigma barriers
  - Communities with medication-assisted treatment (MAT) availability show better engagement
  - Regions with punitive drug courts increase stigma and coerced rather than voluntary treatment
