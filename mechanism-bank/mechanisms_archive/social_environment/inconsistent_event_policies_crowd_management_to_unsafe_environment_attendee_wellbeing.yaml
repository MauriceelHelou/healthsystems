  and safety issues at scale'
- 'Step 2: Absence of effective planning and coordination among sporting agencies,
  tour operators, and service providers creates gaps in safety protocols'
- 'Step 3: Uncoordinated approaches fail to manage negative issues such as alcoholism,
  gambling and violence that emerge in large crowd contexts'
- 'Step 4: Attendees experience unsafe environments that negatively affect their wellbeing
  and health outcomes'
