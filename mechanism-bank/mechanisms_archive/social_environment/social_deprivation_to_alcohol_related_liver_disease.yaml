mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social deprivation creates concentrated disadvantage including limited
  economic resources, poor housing conditions, and reduced access to health-promoting
  resources'
- 'Step 2: These structural conditions increase vulnerability to alcohol use disorders
  through stress pathways, reduced social support networks, and limited access to
  prevention and treatment services'
- 'Step 3: Higher prevalence and severity of alcohol use disorders in socially deprived
  populations leads to increased exposure to hepatotoxic levels of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to healthcare and nutritional resources in socially deprived
  areas reduces early detection and management of liver disease progression'
