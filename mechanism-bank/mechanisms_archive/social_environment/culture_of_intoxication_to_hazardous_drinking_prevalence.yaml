direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Systemic cultural factors embedded in residential college structure create
  an environment where intoxication is normalized'
- 'Step 2: Combined effects of indirect social influences (event attendance norms
  and peer modelling) maintain elevated drinking expectations'
- 'Step 3: Absence of competing social activities and norms creates limited alternatives
  to alcohol-centric socialization'
- 'Step 4: Students engage in hazardous drinking patterns as the default social participation
  behavior within the college ecosystem'

    the culture of intoxication persists through indirect mechanisms, suggesting supportiveness
    alone is insufficient to counter systemic cultural factors

    strategies indicates potential for peer-led interventions to disrupt the culture
