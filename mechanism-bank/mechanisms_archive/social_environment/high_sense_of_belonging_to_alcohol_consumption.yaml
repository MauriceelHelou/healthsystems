mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Between-person analysis shows students with higher average belongingness
  also report higher alcohol consumption overall'
- 'Step 2: Students who feel integrated into college social life may have greater
  exposure to social drinking contexts and opportunities'
- 'Step 3: Social belonging may be achieved partly through participation in peer activities
  where alcohol is present'
- 'Step 4: However, these students are less reactive to changes in perceived norms,
  suggesting their drinking is less driven by approval-seeking'

  description: Between-person effects show that greater alcohol consumption among
    individuals with higher injunctive norms was less evident among students with
    lower average belongingness, suggesting belonging modifies the norms-drinking
    relationship
