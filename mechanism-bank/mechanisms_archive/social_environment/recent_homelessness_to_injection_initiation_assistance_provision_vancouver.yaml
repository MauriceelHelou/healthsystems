  node_name: Provision of Injection Drug Use Initiation Assistance (Vancouver)
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability in Vancouver eliminates private spaces for drug consumption,
  forcing individuals into public or semi-public settings where drug use occurs'
- 'Step 2: Congregation in specific geographic areas (e.g., Downtown Eastside) creates
  dense networks of people who inject drugs with varying levels of experience'
- 'Step 3: The spatial concentration of homeless individuals who use drugs increases
  probability of contact between experienced and novice users'
- 'Step 4: Social bonds formed through shared experience of homelessness may facilitate
  requests for and provision of injection assistance'

  description: Vancouver has more extensive harm reduction infrastructure including
    supervised consumption sites and housing-first programs compared to Tijuana, which
    may partially mitigate but not eliminate the effect of homelessness on injection
    initiation assistance provision
