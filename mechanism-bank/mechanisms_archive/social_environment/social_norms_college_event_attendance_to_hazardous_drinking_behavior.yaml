direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College culture establishes normative expectations to attend social events
  where alcohol consumption is implied'
- 'Step 2: Indirect social influence creates pressure to conform to event attendance
  norms without explicit peer pressure to drink'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to alcohol-centric events normalizes intoxication as
  the default social experience'
- 'Step 4: Students engage in hazardous drinking patterns to align with perceived
  behavioral expectations at events'
