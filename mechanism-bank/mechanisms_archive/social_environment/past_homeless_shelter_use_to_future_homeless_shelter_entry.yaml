direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prior homelessness indicates exposure to structural vulnerabilities including
  poverty, lack of affordable housing, and systemic barriers to housing access'
- 'Step 2: Prior shelter use reflects ongoing housing instability and lack of permanent
  housing solutions in community systems'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers (rental discrimination, lack of supportive housing,
  inadequate income supports) persist after initial shelter use'
- 'Step 4: Without addressing root causes of housing insecurity, individuals remain
  vulnerable to repeated homelessness cycles'

  description: Once adjusting for past shelter use, substance use severity (AUDIT
    and DAST-10 scores) no longer significantly predicted future shelter entry, indicating
    past homelessness is the dominant structural predictor
