direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Population mean alcohol consumption shapes the overall drinking culture
  and norms within communities'
- 'Step 2: Higher per capita consumption increases drinking frequency and quantity
  across the population distribution'
- 'Step 3: Social harms (violence, family problems, injuries to others) increase with
  both individual consumption and exposure to others'' drinking'
- 'Step 4: Population-level increases in consumption create more opportunities for
  harm to occur through increased drinking occasions and intoxication events across
  society'
