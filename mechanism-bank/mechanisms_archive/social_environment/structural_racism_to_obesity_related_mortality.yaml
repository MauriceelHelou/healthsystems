mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential access to healthcare resources,
  nutritious food, and safe exercise spaces for African American communities'
- 'Step 2: Limited access to these resources leads to higher obesity prevalence through
  constrained opportunities for health-promoting behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Higher obesity prevalence increases susceptibility to metabolic and cardiovascular
  disorders'
- 'Step 4: These obesity-related conditions lead to elevated mortality risk, though
  the paper notes this occurs earlier in life and shows complex patterns by race'

  description: The paper notes that obesity disproportionately impacts African American
    communities irrespective of socioeconomic status, suggesting that structural racism
    operates independently of individual economic factors
