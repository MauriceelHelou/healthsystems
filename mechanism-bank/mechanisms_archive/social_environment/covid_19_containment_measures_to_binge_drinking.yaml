direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lockdown policies eliminate supervised social drinking contexts (bars,
  restaurants, organized events) and shift consumption to unsupervised private settings'
- 'Step 2: Loss of normative social environments removes informal peer monitoring
  and social norms that typically moderate drinking intensity'
- 'Step 3: Pandemic-related anxiety and stress accumulate without access to typical
  coping mechanisms or social support structures'
- 'Step 4: Students engage in binge drinking as maladaptive stress response in isolation
  or small unsupervised groups'
