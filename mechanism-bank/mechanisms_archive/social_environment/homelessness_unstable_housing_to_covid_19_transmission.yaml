direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness necessitates use of congregate shelter and supportive housing
  settings with limited personal space and resources'
- 'Step 2: Lack of individual drinking vessels and scarcity of clean cups leads to
  sharing of cups and beverages among residents'
- 'Step 3: Drink sharing creates opportunities for respiratory droplet transmission
  of SARS-CoV-2 virus'
- 'Step 4: Standard outbreak controls insufficient to prevent transmission in contexts
  of resource scarcity and shared living conditions'

  description: Cup distribution was highest among populations with higher rates of
    alcohol use, suggesting drink sharing more common in these contexts

  description: Intervention usefulness was limited in the absence of paired COVID-19
    education, suggesting mechanism operates through both material provision and awareness
