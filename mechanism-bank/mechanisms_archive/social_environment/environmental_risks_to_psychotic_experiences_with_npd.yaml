mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Environmental risk factors (unspecified but likely including trauma, urbanicity,
  social stressors) increase vulnerability'
- 'Step 2: These environmental exposures differentially contribute to psychotic experiences
  that co-occur with non-psychotic disorders'
- 'Step 3: Environmental risks interact with genetic vulnerability (PRS-Sz) and NPD
  presence to create high-risk clinical states'
- 'Step 4: The resulting PE+NPD phenotype is characterized by poor functioning, increased
  service use, and antipsychotic prescription'
