  node_id: covid19_mortality_rate

direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hispanic residents are disproportionately concentrated in neighborhoods
  with higher structural vulnerability due to historical residential segregation and
  discriminatory housing policies'
- 'Step 2: These neighborhoods often have higher density housing conditions and greater
  exposure to essential work requirements during pandemic'
- 'Step 3: Structural barriers including limited access to healthcare, lack of paid
  sick leave, and essential worker status increase COVID-19 exposure risk'
- 'Step 4: Higher infection rates combined with reduced access to quality medical
  care and underlying health conditions from chronic structural stressors lead to
  elevated mortality'
