  node_name: Youth Alcohol Consumption
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol sponsorship of sports creates ambient marketing exposure through
  broadcast media, stadium signage, and branded merchandise that youth encounter as
  spectators'
- 'Step 2: Youth are exposed to alcohol branding without direct participation in sponsored
  sports, normalizing alcohol as part of sports culture from early ages'
- 'Step 3: Repeated indirect exposure during formative developmental periods shapes
  attitudes, perceptions of drinking norms, and brand familiarity'
- 'Step 4: Early normalization and positive associations with alcohol increase likelihood
  of drinking initiation and elevated consumption levels among schoolchildren'
