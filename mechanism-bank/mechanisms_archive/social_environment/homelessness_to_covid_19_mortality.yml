- 'Step 3: Delayed healthcare seeking and treatment due to structural barriers'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes and mortality'

description: Homelessness among people with serious mental illness increases COVID-19 mortality through
  structural barriers to healthcare access, increased viral exposure, and delayed treatment in emergency
  situations.

  description: Serious mental illness compounds homelessness-related health risks through reduced access
    to coordinated care and increased vulnerability
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism directly implicates housing policy failures and inadequate social
    safety nets as root causes of health inequities. The pathway focuses on structural barriers rather
    than individual deficits.
