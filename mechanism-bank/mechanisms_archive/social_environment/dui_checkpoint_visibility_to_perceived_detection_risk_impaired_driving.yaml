  node_name: Perceived Risk of Detection for Impaired Driving
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High visibility enforcement operations (publicized checkpoints, visible
  saturation patrols) create widespread community awareness of enforcement activities'
- 'Step 2: Public awareness increases perceived likelihood of detection and arrest
  for alcohol-impaired driving'
- 'Step 3: Heightened perceived risk creates general deterrence effect across community,
  particularly among targeted age group (15-30 years)'
- 'Step 4: Sustained enforcement presence maintains elevated risk perception over
  time, supporting normative shift away from impaired driving'

  description: High visibility component relies on public awareness; media coverage
    and social media discussion would amplify deterrence effects by increasing perceived
    enforcement presence

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Communities with higher baseline trust in law enforcement may experience
    stronger deterrence effects, while communities with histories of over-policing
    may show resistance or avoidance rather than compliance
