direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social drinking contexts create shared environments where both potential
  perpetrators and victims consume alcohol'
- 'Step 2: Concordant drinking status (both drinking or both not drinking) activates
  social norms and expectations specific to that context'
- 'Step 3: Among men with high MGRS, drinking concordance provides perceived justification
  for aggression through shared responsibility narratives and reduced accountability'
- 'Step 4: The combination of shared intoxication, masculine gender norms, and social
  context creates conditions where sexual aggression is most likely to occur'
