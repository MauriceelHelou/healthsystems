mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social determinants of health (including income, education, insurance status,
  neighborhood resources, environmental exposures) create differential conditions
  for cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment access'
- 'Step 2: These structural factors influence timing of cancer diagnosis, stage at
  presentation, access to high-quality neoadjuvant therapy, and surgical care at specialized
  centers'
- 'Step 3: Social determinants affect ability to complete complex multi-modal treatment
  regimens through impacts on transportation, time off work, social support, and nutrition
  during treatment'
- 'Step 4: The cumulative impact of these structural barriers partially accounts for
  observed racial and ethnic disparities in locally advanced rectal cancer treatment
  outcomes'
