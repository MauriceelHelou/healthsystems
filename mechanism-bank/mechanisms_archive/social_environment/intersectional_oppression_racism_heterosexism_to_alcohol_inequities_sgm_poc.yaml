mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SGM people of color experience simultaneous and intersecting systems of
  oppression from both racism and heterosexism/cissexism'
- 'Step 2: Multiple forms of structural discrimination create compounded minority
  stress that is greater than additive effects'
- 'Step 3: Intersectional stress depletes coping resources and creates unique stressors
  not experienced by white SGM people or heterosexual people of color'
- 'Step 4: Compounded oppression-based stress drives elevated alcohol use as a coping
  mechanism, creating distinct patterns of alcohol inequities'
