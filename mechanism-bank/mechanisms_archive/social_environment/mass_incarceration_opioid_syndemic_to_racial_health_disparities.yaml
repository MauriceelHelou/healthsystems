mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism drives both higher rates of incarceration among people
  of color and differential exposure to opioid use disorder through community disinvestment
  and targeted policing'
- 'Step 2: The intersection of mass incarceration policies and the opioid crisis creates
  a syndemic that disproportionately affects marginalized communities'
- 'Step 3: People of color experience higher rates of opioid overdose and face systematic
  barriers to treatment access in community settings'
- 'Step 4: The compounding effects of criminalization and limited healthcare access
  exacerbate racial health disparities in opioid-related outcomes'

  description: Whether treatment is initiated during incarceration versus community
    significantly moderates how race influences treatment type selection, indicating
    that carceral versus community healthcare systems produce different racialized
    treatment patterns
