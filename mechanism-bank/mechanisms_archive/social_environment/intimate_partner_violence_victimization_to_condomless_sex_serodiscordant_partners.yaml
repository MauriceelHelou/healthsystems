direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Intimate partner violence victimization creates psychological trauma and
  diminished sense of autonomy in relationships'
- 'Step 2: This trauma reduces capacity for sexual negotiation and consent within
  intimate partnerships'
- 'Step 3: Power imbalances resulting from IPV limit ability to insist on protective
  sexual behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Reduced sexual negotiation power leads to increased condomless sex with
  serodiscordant partners'
