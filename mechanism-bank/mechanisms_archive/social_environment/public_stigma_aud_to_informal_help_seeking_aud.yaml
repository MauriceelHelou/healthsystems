direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public stigma creates pervasive negative attitudes toward individuals with
  alcohol use disorders across social networks'
- 'Step 2: Internalization of stigmatizing beliefs reduces willingness to disclose
  alcohol problems to family and friends'
- 'Step 3: Fear of social rejection, judgment, and damaged relationships creates barriers
  to seeking informal support'
- 'Step 4: Reduced informal help-seeking leads to social isolation and lack of social
  support networks for recovery'
