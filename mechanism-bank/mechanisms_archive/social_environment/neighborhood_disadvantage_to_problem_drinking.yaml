mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Disadvantaged neighborhoods have fewer economic opportunities, higher unemployment,
  and limited social infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: These structural conditions create chronic environmental stress and reduce
  availability of health-promoting resources'
- 'Step 3: Limited neighborhood resources and persistent stressors increase risk for
  maladaptive coping mechanisms including substance use'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol outlet density and social norms around drinking may be higher in
  disadvantaged areas, further facilitating problem drinking'
