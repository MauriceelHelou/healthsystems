- 'Step 1: Campus-based prevention program provides male students with specific knowledge
  about recognizing situations where sexual violence risk is present'
- 'Step 2: Training equips participants with concrete intervention strategies and
  skills, reducing barriers to action'
- 'Step 3: Program normalizes bystander intervention as a masculine and prosocial
  behavior, addressing social norms that inhibit helping'
- 'Step 4: Increased self-efficacy and perceived behavioral control lead to greater
  willingness to intervene in potentially harmful situations'
