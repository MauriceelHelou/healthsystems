mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students perceive drinking behaviors of other students at their specific
  university as normative reference'
- 'Step 2: University-specific social environments, campus policies, and institutional
  culture shape drinking norms that vary across institutions'
- 'Step 3: Students use these institution-specific perceived norms to guide their
  own drinking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Higher perceived drinking norms at specific university lead to increased
  individual alcohol consumption'

  description: Previous research found that association between typical college student
    norms and drinking was weaker for Black college students compared to White students,
    suggesting race moderates the strength of general university norms
