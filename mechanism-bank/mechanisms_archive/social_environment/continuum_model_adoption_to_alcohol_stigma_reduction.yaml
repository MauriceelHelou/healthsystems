- 'Step 1: Stakeholders promote a continuum model that presents alcohol use disorder
  as dimensional rather than categorical'
- 'Step 2: Continuum framing reduces artificial boundaries between ''normal'' and
  ''pathological'' drinking'
- 'Step 3: Othering and social distance decrease as people recognize shared vulnerability
  along a spectrum'
- 'Step 4: Stigma reduction occurs through decreased dichotomization and increased
  empathy'
