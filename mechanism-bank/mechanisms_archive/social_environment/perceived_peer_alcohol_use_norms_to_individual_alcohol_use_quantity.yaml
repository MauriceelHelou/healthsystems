direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students observe and form beliefs about how much alcohol typical peers
  consume and how those quantities changed during the pandemic'
- 'Step 2: Perceived peer drinking quantities establish normative expectations for
  consumption amounts in social contexts'
- 'Step 3: Students calibrate their own drinking quantities to match perceived peer
  norms, consuming more when they believe peers drink more and less when they believe
  peers drink less'
- 'Step 4: Strong relationship between perceived changes in peer quantity and individual
  quantity changes demonstrates normative influence on consumption amounts'
