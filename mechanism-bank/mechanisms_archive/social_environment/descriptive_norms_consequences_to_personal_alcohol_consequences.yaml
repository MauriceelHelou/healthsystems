mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students observe or perceive that peers frequently experience negative
  consequences in specific drinking locations'
- 'Step 2: These descriptive norms create expectations that consequences are common
  and unavoidable in certain settings'
- 'Step 3: Perception of peer consequence experiences normalizes risk-taking behavior
  and reduces perceived severity of potential harms'
- 'Step 4: Students engage in similar drinking patterns and behaviors as perceived
  peers, leading to comparable consequence experiences'
