direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Residential college structure creates concentrated social networks with
  high interaction frequency among peers'
- 'Step 2: Indirect social influence operates through normative expectations and behavioral
  modelling rather than explicit pressure'
- 'Step 3: Students perceive choice in drinking decisions while simultaneously facing
  implicit environmental cues promoting alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: The culture self-perpetuates as new cohorts are socialized into existing
  norms through indirect mechanisms'
