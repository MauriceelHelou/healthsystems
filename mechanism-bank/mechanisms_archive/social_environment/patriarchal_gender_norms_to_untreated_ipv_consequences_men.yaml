direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patriarchal gender norms define masculinity as dominant and invulnerable,
  stigmatizing male victimization'
- 'Step 2: Cultural stigma prevents men from disclosing IPV victimization or seeking
  help from formal services'
- 'Step 3: Lack of help-seeking means violence continues unaddressed and men remain
  isolated without support'
- 'Step 4: Ongoing violence without intervention leads to accumulating physical injuries,
  psychological trauma, and social consequences'
