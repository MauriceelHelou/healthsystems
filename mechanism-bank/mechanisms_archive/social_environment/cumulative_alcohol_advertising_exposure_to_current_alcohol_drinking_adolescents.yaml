direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple alcohol advertising channels (web, stores, public transit) create
  cumulative and reinforcing exposure across different life domains'
- 'Step 2: Cross-platform advertising saturation increases message frequency and reduces
  ability to avoid alcohol-related content'
- 'Step 3: Dose-response relationship emerges as exposure across more media types
  compounds normalization effects and reduces perceived risk'
- 'Step 4: Higher cumulative exposure progressively increases likelihood of current
  drinking behavior with each additional media type'
