mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates overcrowded or unstable living conditions'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing reduces ability to maintain social distancing and hygiene practices'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure to COVID-19 transmission in shared or temporary housing facilities'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of COVID-19 infection and severe illness outcomes'

description: Housing instability among people with serious mental illness increases COVID-19 morbidity
  risk through reduced ability to maintain protective behaviors and increased exposure in congregate or
  temporary housing settings.

  description: People with serious mental illness face compounded vulnerability due to both housing instability
    and underlying health conditions
structural_competency:
  equity_implications: This mechanism traces to structural housing policies and availability of affordable
    housing. The causal pathway avoids individual blame and focuses on how housing systems create differential
    health risks for vulnerable populations.
