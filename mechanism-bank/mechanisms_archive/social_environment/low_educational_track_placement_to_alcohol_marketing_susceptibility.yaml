direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Educational tracking systems sort students by academic performance, which
  correlates with socioeconomic background and creates stratified school environments'
- 'Step 2: Students in lower educational tracks may have differential exposure to
  protective factors (parental monitoring, health literacy programs, critical media
  literacy skills)'
- 'Step 3: Lower educational tracks may have fewer institutional resources for health
  education and substance use prevention programming'
- 'Step 4: Students from lower school levels demonstrate greater vulnerability to
  alcohol marketing messages and higher rates of drinking initiation when exposed
  to advertisements'
