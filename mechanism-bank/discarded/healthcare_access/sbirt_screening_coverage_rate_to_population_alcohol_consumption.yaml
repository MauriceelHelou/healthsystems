- 'Step 1: Increased screening coverage in primary healthcare settings identifies
  more individuals with risky drinking patterns'
- 'Step 2: Identified risky drinkers receive brief intervention or referral to treatment
  based on their consumption levels'
- 'Step 3: Evidence-based interventions reduce individual alcohol consumption among
  those receiving treatment'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effect of individual-level reductions aggregates to measurable
  population-level decreases in alcohol consumption'

  description: Screening coverage rates below 10% were not found to have measurable
    effect on drinking levels, indicating a threshold effect where higher coverage
    dramatically increases impact
- name: screening_coverage_50_percent
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: At 50% screening coverage, 21% of adult residents received BI or RT
    over 10 years, resulting in 12% reduction in population alcohol consumption
