direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory 6-month abstinence policy requires patients to cease alcohol
  consumption before transplant listing eligibility'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol abstinence allows liver regeneration and functional recovery in
  patients with alcohol-associated liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Clinical improvement from abstinence leads to stabilization or reversal
  of end-stage liver disease indicators'
- 'Step 4: Patients improve sufficiently to no longer meet medical criteria for transplantation
  and are removed from wait-list'

  description: Women with ALD had higher chance of wait-list removal for improvement
    (SHR 2.91, 95% CI 2.35-3.61, P<0.001) compared to men with ALD, though the exact
    sex-stratified comparison is not fully detailed
