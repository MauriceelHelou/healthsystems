mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: LGBQ-affirmative CBT addresses minority stress processes stemming from
  structural stigma and discrimination experienced by sexual minority men'
- 'Step 2: Treatment reduces internalized stigma, improves coping with external stressors,
  and addresses transdiagnostic mental health concerns'
- 'Step 3: Improvements in minority stress processing lead to reductions in depression,
  anxiety symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Reduced psychological distress and improved coping mechanisms decrease
  alcohol and drug use problems'
- 'Step 5: Overall reduction in comorbidity index including mental health, substance
  use, and HIV transmission risk behaviors'
