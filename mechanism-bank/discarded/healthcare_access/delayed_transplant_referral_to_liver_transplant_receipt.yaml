direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinical indication for transplant evaluation occurs (decompensation or
  MELD-Na ≥15) but referral is delayed'
- 'Step 2: Disease severity progresses during delay period, increasing medical complexity
  and reducing transplant candidacy'
- 'Step 3: Patients present for inpatient evaluation in more advanced disease states
  with multiple comorbidities'
- 'Step 4: Advanced disease and complications reduce likelihood of being listed or
  receiving transplant before death'
