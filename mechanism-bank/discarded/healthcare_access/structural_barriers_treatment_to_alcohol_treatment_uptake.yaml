mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural barriers (geographic distance, cost, limited service hours,
  transportation) restrict physical and economic access to traditional treatment services'
- 'Step 2: People with alcohol use problems encounter multiple simultaneous barriers
  (mean = 5.64 barriers endorsed)'
- 'Step 3: High barrier burden prevents treatment-seeking despite high severity of
  alcohol problems'
- 'Step 4: Result is low treatment uptake with fewer than one-third accessing treatment
  previously despite significant need'
