- 'Step 1: Standardized symptom-triggered protocol (Yale Alcohol Withdrawal Protocol)
  pairs modified Minnesota Detoxification Scale with structured order sets for benzodiazepine
  dosing'
- 'Step 2: Protocolized approach enables systematic monitoring and titration of sedative
  medications matched to objective withdrawal severity scores'
- 'Step 3: Appropriate benzodiazepine dosing prevents severe autonomic instability
  and respiratory compromise associated with uncontrolled alcohol withdrawal syndrome'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of severe withdrawal complications reduces respiratory distress
  and need for mechanical ventilation support'
