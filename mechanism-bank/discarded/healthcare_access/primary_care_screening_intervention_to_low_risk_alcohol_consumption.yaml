mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care practices implement standardized 15-method screening protocol
  with healthcare professional training'
- 'Step 2: Systematic screening identifies hazardous and harmful alcohol use at earlier
  stages across diverse age groups'
- 'Step 3: Flexible treatment offers are provided in familiar primary care setting,
  reducing barriers to intervention'
- 'Step 4: Clear treatment directives and communication tools enable healthcare professionals
  to address traditionally challenging topic'
- 'Step 5: Early identification and intervention leads to reduction in alcohol consumption
  to low-risk levels'
