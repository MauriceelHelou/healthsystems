direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater geographic distance to specialized healthcare services increases
  travel time, transportation costs, and scheduling barriers'
- 'Step 2: Nonopioid pain treatments (physical therapy, multidisciplinary pain clinics,
  interventional procedures) require multiple visits over time'
- 'Step 3: Distance-related barriers make nonopioid alternatives practically inaccessible
  for rural populations with limited transportation or work flexibility'
- 'Step 4: Structural geographic barriers limit treatment options and channel patients
  toward opioid-based management'
