direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workplace-based health services are positioned as universally available
  to all employees regardless of socioeconomic status or ethnicity'
- 'Step 2: Integration of alcohol screening into comprehensive health checks (including
  smoking, diet, physical activity) normalizes screening and reduces stigma'
- 'Step 3: Online format provides convenience and perceived confidentiality (60% confident),
  reducing barriers to participation'
- 'Step 4: Embedding in workplace setting reaches working-age hazardous drinkers who
  would not typically seek help through traditional healthcare channels'
