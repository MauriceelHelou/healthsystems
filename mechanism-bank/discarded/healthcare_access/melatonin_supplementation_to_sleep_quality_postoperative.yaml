mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Melatonin supplementation (5mg nightly) provided as structured intervention
  following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair'
- 'Step 2: Melatonin regulates circadian rhythm and promotes sleep onset in post-surgical
  context where pain and inflammation disrupt normal sleep patterns'
- 'Step 3: Improved sleep architecture and quality measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
  Index (PSQI) scores'
- 'Step 4: Lower PSQI scores indicate better sleep quality during critical early postoperative
  healing period (6 weeks)'
