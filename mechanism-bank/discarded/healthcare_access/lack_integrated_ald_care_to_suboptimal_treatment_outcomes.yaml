mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fragmented healthcare systems separate addiction treatment from hepatology/gastroenterology
  care'
- 'Step 2: Patients with co-occurring AUD and liver disease face barriers accessing
  coordinated care, requiring navigation of separate systems'
- 'Step 3: Lack of multidisciplinary coordination results in missed opportunities
  for alcohol cessation interventions, medication management, and liver disease monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Suboptimal care integration leads to worse treatment adherence, continued
  alcohol use, and poorer liver-related outcomes'
