mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Inpatient psychiatric facility implements standardized symptom-triggered
  protocol for alcohol withdrawal'
- 'Step 2: Protocol uses validated assessment tools to objectively measure withdrawal
  severity'
- 'Step 3: Medication administration (benzodiazepines) is triggered by symptom scores
  rather than fixed schedules'
- 'Step 4: Individualized dosing reduces both under-treatment (preventing complications)
  and over-sedation risks'
- 'Step 5: Study monitored complicated withdrawal frequency as safety outcome'
