mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Integrated healthcare system implements system-wide alcohol screening,
  brief intervention, and referral to treatment in adult primary care'
- 'Step 2: Patients with hypertension who screen positive for unhealthy alcohol use
  receive brief intervention counseling during routine primary care visits'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention provides immediate feedback, education about health
  risks, and motivational support to reduce drinking intensity'
- 'Step 4: Patients modify drinking patterns, resulting in reduction of drinks consumed
  per drinking occasion at 12-month follow-up'
