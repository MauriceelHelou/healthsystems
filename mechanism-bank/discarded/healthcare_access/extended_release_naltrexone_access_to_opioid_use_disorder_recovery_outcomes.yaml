direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: XR-NTX provides sustained opioid receptor blockade, preventing euphoric
  effects of opioid use'
- 'Step 2: Monthly injection format eliminates daily adherence challenges common with
  oral medications'
- 'Step 3: Sustained receptor blockade reduces relapse risk and supports abstinence
  maintenance'
- 'Step 4: Improved abstinence and reduced relapse support composite recovery outcomes
  including self-help engagement, employment, and criminal justice outcomes'
