mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of systematic routine outcome monitoring (ROM) creates organizational
  infrastructure for tracking participant progress'
- 'Step 2: ROM integrated into group sessions normalizes measurement and feedback
  as part of recovery process rather than research burden'
- 'Step 3: Real-time feedback via mHealth app increases participant awareness of recovery
  trajectory and reinforces progress'
- 'Step 4: Data analytics on usage patterns enable facilitators and organizations
  to identify barriers to engagement'
- 'Step 5: Enhanced monitoring and feedback infrastructure improves sustained engagement
  with mutual support programming'
