- 'Step 1: Absence of disease-modifying therapeutic agents prevents intervention on
  underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of CP'
- 'Step 2: Without effective drugs to halt inflammation, fibrosis, and cellular damage,
  disease continues to advance'
- 'Step 3: Progressive pancreatic damage leads to worsening exocrine and endocrine
  dysfunction'
- 'Step 4: Systematic gap in drug development pipeline creates structural barrier
  to preventing disease progression across patient populations'
