direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater travel distances to MAT prescribers create logistical barriers
  including increased time, cost, and transportation challenges for rural Medicaid
  enrollees'
- 'Step 2: These barriers reduce ability to maintain regular appointments for prescription
  refills and clinical monitoring'
- 'Step 3: Disruptions in appointment attendance lead to gaps in medication availability'
- 'Step 4: Discontinuous pharmacotherapy reduces treatment effectiveness and increases
  relapse risk'
