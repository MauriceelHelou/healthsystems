mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with mental health symptoms (depression, PTSD, hazardous alcohol
  use) must first recognize their condition as problematic and warranting intervention'
- 'Step 2: Recognition of problems triggers cognitive evaluation of need for professional
  help and overcomes denial or normalization of symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Acknowledgment of problem severity increases motivation to seek care and
  engage with available mental health services'
- 'Step 4: Veterans who recognize problems are more likely to initiate contact with
  mental health providers within primary care settings'
