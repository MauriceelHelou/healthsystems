mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol is the leading cause of cirrhosis worldwide'
- 'Step 2: In some Latin American countries, alcohol represents only the second indication
  for liver transplant'
- 'Step 3: This disparity suggests barriers to transplant access for patients with
  alcohol-related liver disease'
- 'Step 4: Potential barriers include stigma, abstinence requirements, resource allocation,
  or systemic exclusion of ALD patients from transplant lists'
