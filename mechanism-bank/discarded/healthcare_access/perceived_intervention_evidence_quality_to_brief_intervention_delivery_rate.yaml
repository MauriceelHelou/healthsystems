mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher clinician perception of ASBI evidence quality increases confidence
  in intervention effectiveness'
- 'Step 2: Confidence in evidence base motivates clinicians to prioritize brief intervention
  delivery during time-constrained visits'
- 'Step 3: Positive evidence perceptions support organizational justification for
  resource allocation to intervention programs'
- 'Step 4: Evidence-based confidence facilitates sustained intervention delivery over
  time despite competing clinical demands'
