mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of official Russian AUDIT translation results in 61+ unique versions
  with inconsistent translations across healthcare settings'
- 'Step 2: Translation inconsistencies particularly in consumption items and standard
  drink definitions prevent accurate assessment of drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare providers unable to reliably screen for hazardous and harmful
  alcohol use due to non-standardized, non-validated instruments'
- 'Step 4: Reduced identification of at-risk individuals in primary care settings,
  limiting early intervention opportunities'
