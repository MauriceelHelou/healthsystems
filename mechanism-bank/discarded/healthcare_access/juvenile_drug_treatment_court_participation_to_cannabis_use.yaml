- 'Step 1: Juvenile Drug Treatment Courts (JDTC) provide structured court-supervised
  treatment programs that integrate judicial oversight with substance abuse treatment
  services'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced access to evidence-based treatment services and consistent monitoring
  creates accountability structures for youth in the juvenile justice system'
- 'Step 3: Regular court appearances and drug testing provide external structure and
  motivation for behavior change among moderate- to high-risk youth'
- 'Step 4: Reduced cannabis use results from combination of treatment access, judicial
  oversight, and structured support systems'
