mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare professionals face systemic barriers including limited time,
  lack of training, and absence of conversation frameworks for sensitive topics'
- 'Step 2: These structural constraints create difficulty in opening conversations
  about alcohol use during routine consultations'
- 'Step 3: When conversations are not initiated, opportunistic screening opportunities
  are missed'
- 'Step 4: Lower screening completion rates result in reduced identification of alcohol-related
  problems at early intervention points'
