mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of universal SBIRT screening in primary care clinics creates
  systematic identification processes for substance use problems in routine medical
  encounters'
- 'Step 2: Standardized screening tools increase healthcare provider awareness and
  recognition of substance use disorder symptoms among patients who might otherwise
  go undetected'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention protocols provide clinical framework for documenting
  substance use concerns in medical records and claims data'
- 'Step 4: Increased clinical recognition leads to formal DSM-IV diagnosis documentation
  on Medicaid claims for alcohol and drug abuse or dependence'
