direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Shorter geographic distance to CHW reduces travel time and transportation
  barriers for caregivers with febrile children'
- 'Step 2: Reduced travel burden increases feasibility of seeking care promptly when
  child develops fever symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Greater accessibility makes CHW the practical first point of consultation
  compared to more distant health facilities'
- 'Step 4: Increased utilization of CHW services enables earlier malaria treatment
  for under-five children'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Trust in CHW services showed very strong association with utilization
    (aOR=7.8, p<0.001), suggesting that proximity alone insufficient without community
    confidence in service quality
- name: household_asset_index
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Lower asset index associated with higher CHW utilization (aOR=1.9,
    p=0.02), indicating distance effects may be stronger for poorer households with
    fewer transportation options

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Mother being the decision maker for site of first consultation associated
    with higher CHW utilization (aOR=1.9, p=0.01), suggesting gendered patterns in
    how proximity affects care-seeking
