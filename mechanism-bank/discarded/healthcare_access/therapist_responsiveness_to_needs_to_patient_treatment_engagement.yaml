  with any issue or concern relevant to them, not just mandated treatment goals'
- 'Step 2: Therapists recognize and respond to patients'' diverse needs beyond court-ordered
  treatment requirements'
- 'Step 3: This inclusive attitude demonstrates respect for patient as whole person
  with legitimate needs despite criminal justice involvement'

- 'Step 5: Enhanced trust and therapeutic alliance lead to increased engagement and
  motivation in mandated treatment'
