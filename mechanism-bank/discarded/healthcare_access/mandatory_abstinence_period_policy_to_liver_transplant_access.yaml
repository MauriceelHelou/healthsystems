direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory abstinence period policies require patients with alcoholic liver
  disease to demonstrate sobriety for a set time period before transplant eligibility'
- 'Step 2: These policies create structural barriers to transplant access, particularly
  for patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis who may not survive the waiting period'
- 'Step 3: New research questions the effectiveness of these abstinence periods as
  selection criteria, suggesting they may unnecessarily restrict access without improving
  outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Patients who could benefit from transplantation are excluded from consideration
  based on time-based rather than clinical criteria'
