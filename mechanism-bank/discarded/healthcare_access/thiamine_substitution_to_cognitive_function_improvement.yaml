mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine supplementation restores blood TPP levels in patients with alcohol
  use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Increased TPP availability restores thiamine-dependent enzymatic function
  in brain tissue'
- 'Step 3: Neuronal energy metabolism and glucose utilization normalize in cognitive
  brain regions'
- 'Step 4: Cognitive performance, particularly memory function, improves as neuronal
  function is restored'
