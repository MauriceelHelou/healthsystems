mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Formal or informal sobriety requirement policies restrict transplant eligibility
  for patients with alcoholic hepatitis who have less than 6 months of sobriety'
- 'Step 2: Patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis may die while waiting to meet sobriety
  criteria, as their condition is often rapidly progressive'
- 'Step 3: Controversy within transplant community regarding acceptance criteria creates
  inconsistent access across transplant centers'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to transplantation for patients who could benefit from life-saving
  intervention despite shorter sobriety periods'
