category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinical protocols prioritize dextrose and antiemetic treatment for hyperemesis
  gravidarum without concurrent thiamine replacement'
- 'Step 2: Dextrose administration without thiamine depletes existing thiamine stores
  as glucose metabolism requires thiamine as cofactor'
- 'Step 3: Severe thiamine deficiency disrupts neuronal energy metabolism in vulnerable
  brain regions (mammillary bodies, thalamus)'
- 'Step 4: Initial Wernicke''s encephalopathy (acute confusional state, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia)
  progresses to Korsakoff psychosis (irreversible memory impairment and cognitive
  dysfunction)'
