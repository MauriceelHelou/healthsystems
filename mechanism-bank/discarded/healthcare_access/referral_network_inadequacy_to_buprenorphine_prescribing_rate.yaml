direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of integrated referral networks for behavioral health, social services,
  and specialty care limits comprehensive patient support infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians perceive inability to provide holistic care for complex opioid
  use disorder patients without robust referral options'
- 'Step 3: Absence of care coordination systems increases clinician burden and concerns
  about patient outcomes'
- 'Step 4: Clinicians avoid prescribing buprenorphine due to structural gaps in support
  services, limiting treatment access'
