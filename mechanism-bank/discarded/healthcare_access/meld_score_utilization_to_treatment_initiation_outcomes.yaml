- 'Step 1: MELD score provides validated prognostic assessment for liver disease severity'
- 'Step 2: Accurate risk stratification enables identification of patients requiring
  immediate therapy'
- 'Step 3: Early treatment initiation based on MELD scoring improves response rates'
- 'Step 4: Appropriate resource allocation to high-risk patients reduces mortality'
