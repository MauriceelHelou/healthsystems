mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Molecular biomarkers enable prognosis of treatment response and relapse
  risk in AUD patients'
- 'Step 2: Early identification of non-responders or high-relapse-risk patients allows
  clinical intervention adjustments'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare providers can intensify psychosocial support or modify pharmacotherapy
  based on biomarker data'
- 'Step 4: Proactive treatment modifications reduce relapse rates and improve long-term
  recovery outcomes'
