mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Robotic transplant eligibility limited to MELD score ≤25, specific anatomical
  characteristics, and logistical requirements'
- 'Step 2: Patients with more advanced disease, complex anatomy, or lacking logistical
  resources are systematically excluded from robotic approach'
- 'Step 3: Exclusion criteria disproportionately affect marginalized populations with
  delayed diagnoses, limited healthcare access, or geographic barriers'
- 'Step 4: Technology benefits accrue primarily to healthier, well-resourced patients
  while sicker or disadvantaged patients continue with standard approaches'
