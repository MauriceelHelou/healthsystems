direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Anti-biofilm agents including antibiotics, natural compounds, and anti-biofilm
  enzymes face delivery challenges'
- 'Step 2: Low penetration prevents therapeutic agents from reaching bacteria within
  biofilm matrix'
- 'Step 3: High susceptibility to degradation and instability reduces effective drug
  concentrations at infection site'
- 'Step 4: Poor solubility in aqueous solutions limits bioavailability and therapeutic
  efficacy'
- 'Step 5: These limitations prevent clinical use and lead to persistent infections
  and treatment failure'
