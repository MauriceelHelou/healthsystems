mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bariatric surgery produces sustained weight loss and reduces visceral adiposity'
- 'Step 2: Decreased adipose tissue inflammation and improved adipokine profile'
- 'Step 3: Resolution or improvement of metabolic syndrome components (hyperglycemia,
  dyslipidemia, hypertension) before conception'
- 'Step 4: Lower burden of metabolic dysfunction during pregnancy reduces maternal
  and fetal complications'
