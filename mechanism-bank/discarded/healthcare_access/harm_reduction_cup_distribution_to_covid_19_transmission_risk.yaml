- 'Step 1: Distribution of disposable paper cups through mixed service delivery (health
  staff, non-profits, peers with lived experience) to shelters, supportive housing,
  and outreach sites'
- 'Step 2: Provision of individual cups eliminates need for drink sharing among people
  experiencing homelessness'
- 'Step 3: Reduced drink sharing decreases opportunities for respiratory droplet transmission
  of SARS-CoV-2'
- 'Step 4: Intervention creates engagement opportunities for COVID-19 education and
  safer drinking practices'
