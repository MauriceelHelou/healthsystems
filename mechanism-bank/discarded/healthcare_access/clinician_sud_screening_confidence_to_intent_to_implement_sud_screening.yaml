- 'Step 1: Increased clinician confidence reduces perceived barriers to implementing
  screening, brief intervention, and medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced self-efficacy translates to concrete intentions to change clinical
  practice patterns'
- 'Step 3: Clinicians report increased intent to implement SBI and pharmacotherapy
  for alcohol, nicotine, and opioid use disorders'
- 'Step 4: Practice intentions create conditions for expanded screening and early
  intervention in primary care settings where most patients access healthcare'
