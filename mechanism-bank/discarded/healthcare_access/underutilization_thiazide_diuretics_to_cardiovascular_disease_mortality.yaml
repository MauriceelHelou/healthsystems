mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Only 5.9% of Black adults with apparent treatment-resistant hypertension
  (aTRH) receive thiazide-like diuretics despite American Heart Association recommendations'
- 'Step 2: Lack of access to evidence-based pharmacological treatment leads to inadequate
  blood pressure control in population with resistant hypertension'
- 'Step 3: Uncontrolled blood pressure in aTRH population increases cardiovascular
  disease risk'
- 'Step 4: Elevated cardiovascular disease risk translates to increased cardiovascular-related
  morbidity and mortality among Black adults'
