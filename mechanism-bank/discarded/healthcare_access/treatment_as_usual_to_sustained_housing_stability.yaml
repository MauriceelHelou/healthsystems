direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Treatment as usual typically requires individuals to engage in mental health
  or substance use treatment before accessing stable housing'
- 'Step 2: For some individuals, treatment engagement improves mental health symptoms
  sufficiently to enable housing acquisition'
- 'Step 3: Treatment-first approach may select for individuals with less severe conditions
  or greater treatment responsiveness'
- 'Step 4: Approximately 28% achieve sustained housing through this pathway, though
  at much lower rates and likely longer timelines than Housing First'
