direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency departments implement phenobarbital-based treatment protocols
  for alcohol withdrawal management as an alternative to benzodiazepine-only protocols'
- 'Step 2: Phenobarbital provides more effective symptom control and longer duration
  of action compared to benzodiazepines alone, leading to more complete resolution
  of withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Patients experience better symptomatic relief and stabilization during
  the index ED encounter, reducing physiological need for acute medical care'
- 'Step 4: Reduced need for return emergency care within 3 days of discharge due to
  adequate symptom management'

    equivalents, suggesting more intensive symptom management may contribute to reduced
