direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low-barrier community-based settings eliminate structural barriers such
  as appointment scheduling, transportation requirements, and stigmatizing clinical
  environments that prevent continuous MOUD access'
- 'Step 2: Drop-in model allows flexible access aligned with individuals'' daily survival
  needs and competing demands (housing instability, employment precarity)'
- 'Step 3: Co-location with harm reduction and homeless services reduces fragmentation
  of care and provides wrap-around support'
- 'Step 4: Increased treatment continuity results from sustained engagement enabled
  by reduced structural barriers'
