mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mobile-based application increases accessibility of intervention content
  to college students regardless of geographic location or counseling center capacity'
- 'Step 2: Easy-to-use, engaging mobile platform broadens reach to millions of students
  who may not access traditional campus counseling services'
- 'Step 3: Personalized pregaming-specific content with cognitive behavioral skills
  provides tools to reduce heavy drinking in high-risk contexts'
- 'Step 4: Harm reduction skills specific to pregaming contexts enable students to
  decrease drinking behavior during these episodes'
