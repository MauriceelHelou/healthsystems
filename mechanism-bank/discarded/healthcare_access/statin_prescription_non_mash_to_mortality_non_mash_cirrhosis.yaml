direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Statin therapy prescribed to non-MASH cirrhosis patients, particularly
  those with high disease severity (MELD-Na)'
- 'Step 2: In advanced non-MASH cirrhosis, statins may have paradoxical effects due
  to altered hepatic metabolism and synthetic function'
- 'Step 3: High MELD-Na patients have reduced ability to metabolize statins and increased
  risk of medication-related complications'
- 'Step 4: Potential hepatotoxicity or drug interactions in severely decompensated
  non-MASH cirrhosis increase mortality risk'
