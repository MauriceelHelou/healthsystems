direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Providers lack current knowledge of transplant candidacy guidelines and
  referral criteria'
- 'Step 2: Misconceptions lead providers to incorrectly assess patients as ineligible
  for transplant evaluation'
- 'Step 3: Referrals are not made despite patients meeting clinical indication criteria
  (decompensation or MELD-Na ≥15)'
- 'Step 4: Delay in referral continues until patients become critically ill requiring
  emergent inpatient evaluation'
