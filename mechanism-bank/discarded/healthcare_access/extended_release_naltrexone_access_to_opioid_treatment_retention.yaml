direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: XR-NTX requires monthly clinic visits for injection administration, creating
  regular treatment engagement points'
- 'Step 2: Sustained opioid receptor blockade reduces withdrawal and craving between
  visits'
- 'Step 3: Reduced symptoms and regular appointment structure support continued treatment
  participation'
- 'Step 4: Regular provider contact enables ongoing clinical monitoring and psychosocial
  support integration'

  description: Buprenorphine/naloxone showed superior retention compared to XR-NTX,
    suggesting different medication mechanisms affect retention differently
