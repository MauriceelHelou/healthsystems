- 'Step 1: Fully robotic approach requires robotic donor hepatectomy followed by robotic
  recipient transplantation'
- 'Step 2: Coordinating two complex robotic procedures with same surgical team extends
  total operative time'
- 'Step 3: Median operation time of 10 hours reflects technical complexity of novel
  fully robotic approach'
- 'Step 4: Extended operative time may have implications for anesthesia risk, resource
  utilization, and scheduling capacity'
