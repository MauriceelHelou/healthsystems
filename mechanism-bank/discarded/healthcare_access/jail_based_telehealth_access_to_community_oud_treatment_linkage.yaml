direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Telehealth videoconferencing technology enables clinical assessment and
  MOUD provider contact while women are still incarcerated in jail facilities'
- 'Step 2: Pre-release contact with community MOUD providers establishes treatment
  relationships and care plans before jail release'
- 'Step 3: Early establishment of provider-patient relationships and treatment planning
  facilitates successful linkage to community-based MOUD services upon re-entry'
- 'Step 4: Successful linkage to community MOUD treatment increases access to medications
  for opioid use disorder in the community setting'
