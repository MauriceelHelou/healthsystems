mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pharmacist initiates, modifies, or discontinues withdrawal medications
  in 148 of 282 assessed high-risk patients, optimizing pharmacotherapy timing and
  dosing'
- 'Step 2: Systematic CIWA-Ar monitoring by trained pharmacist enables early detection
  of inadequate medication response before progression to medical emergency'
- 'Step 3: Proactive medication adjustments prevent escalation of withdrawal symptoms
  that would otherwise require higher-level acute care intervention'
- 'Step 4: Only 48 of 1,263 patients (3.8%) required transfer to acute care facilities,
  suggesting majority of withdrawal managed successfully within correctional healthcare
  setting'
