mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peer recovery coaches provide continuity of care during the vulnerable
  transition period between inpatient withdrawal management and outpatient treatment'
- 'Step 2: Daily motivational texts, appointment reminders, and responsive check-ins
  reduce structural barriers to care access (e.g., missed appointments, loss of connection
  to treatment system)'
- 'Step 3: Lived experience of recovery in coaches builds trust and relatability,
  reducing stigma-based barriers to treatment engagement'
- 'Step 4: Consistent monitoring through BAM responses allows early identification
  of concerns and proactive outreach, preventing treatment discontinuation'
