mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early administration of benzodiazepines (diazepam or lorazepam) during
  initial alcohol withdrawal phase provides GABAergic support to counteract acute
  reduction in inhibitory neurotransmission'
- 'Step 2: Pharmacological intervention stabilizes central nervous system hyperexcitability
  and prevents escalation of withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Prevention of symptom escalation reduces risk of developing withdrawal
  seizures, perceptual disturbances, and delirium tremens'
- 'Step 4: Early treatment prevents the 5-10% progression rate to serious medical
  and psychiatric complications'
