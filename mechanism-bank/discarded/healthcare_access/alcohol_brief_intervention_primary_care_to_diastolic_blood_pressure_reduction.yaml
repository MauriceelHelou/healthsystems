category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: System-wide implementation of alcohol screening and brief intervention
  in primary care identifies patients with hypertension and unhealthy alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Brief intervention delivered during routine care reduces alcohol consumption
  over 12-month period'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol intake leads to decreased vascular resistance and improved
  cardiovascular hemodynamics'
- 'Step 4: Patients experience clinically meaningful reduction in diastolic blood
  pressure (≥3 mm Hg) at 18-month follow-up'
- 'Step 5: Blood pressure improvements occur through direct physiological effects
  of reduced alcohol consumption on cardiovascular system'
