direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional transplant medicine held belief that 6-month pretransplant
  abstinence requirement reduces post-transplant alcohol relapse risk'
- 'Step 2: Only 12.7% of directors now affirm this statement, indicating widespread
  recognition that the requirement lacks evidence base'
- 'Step 3: Rejection of this belief removes justification for maintaining 6-month
  abstinence as eligibility criterion'
- 'Step 4: All responding centers now evaluate patients for ELT, reflecting policy
  shift away from arbitrary abstinence requirements'

    are more likely to adopt ELT policies when evidence shows 6-month rule lacks predictive
    validity

  description: Despite lack of evidence for 6-month rule, 55.4% still emphasize low
    relapse risk in listing decisions, suggesting persistent stigma may slow full
    policy reform
