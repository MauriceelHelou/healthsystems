mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of systematic detection methods (clinical interview, standardized
  surveys, biomarkers) identifies patients with alcohol use who would otherwise remain
  undetected'
- 'Step 2: Detection enables formal diagnosis of AUD through interview-based processes
  with addiction professionals or severity assessment via surveys'
- 'Step 3: Diagnosis triggers referral pathways to formal AUD treatment, especially
  for more severe cases'
- 'Step 4: Treatment referral connects patients to therapeutic modalities including
  psychotherapy, group therapy, mutual aid, and medications'
