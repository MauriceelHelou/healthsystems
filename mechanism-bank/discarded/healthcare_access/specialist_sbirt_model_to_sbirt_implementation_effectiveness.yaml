direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Screening positive adolescents must be handed off from primary care provider
  to behavioral health counselor for brief intervention'
- 'Step 2: Handoff process introduces additional steps, scheduling challenges, and
  potential for patient loss between screening and intervention'
- 'Step 3: Fragmented care delivery results in lower completion rates of brief intervention
  among those who screen positive, reducing preventive service penetration'
