mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lorazepam as symptom-triggered standard of care requires frequent assessment
  and dosing adjustments'
- 'Step 2: Short-acting benzodiazepine necessitates intensive nursing monitoring and
  repeated medication administration'
- 'Step 3: Extended hospital length of stay (3.6 vs 2.8 days) increases bed occupancy
  and healthcare costs'
- 'Step 4: Higher readmission rates and ED utilization compound overall healthcare
  resource consumption'
