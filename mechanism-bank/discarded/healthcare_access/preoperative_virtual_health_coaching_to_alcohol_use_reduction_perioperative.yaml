direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Virtual Health Coaching provides accessible, non-pharmacological therapeutic
  intervention prior to scheduled surgery'
- 'Step 2: Intervention leverages the ''teachable moment'' when patients are motivated
  to optimize health before surgery'
- 'Step 3: Brief therapeutic approach addresses alcohol use patterns in the weeks
  leading up to surgery when reduction has greatest protective benefit'
- 'Step 4: Tailored coaching supports behavioral change to achieve low-risk alcohol
  consumption before surgical stress'
