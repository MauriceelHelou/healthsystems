mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Asynchronous online training provides flexible, accessible education on
  screening, brief intervention (SBI), and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment
  to primary care clinicians'
- 'Step 2: Training addresses knowledge gaps about screening tools (e.g., adolescent
  screening instruments) and clinical definitions (e.g., excessive drinking thresholds)'
- 'Step 3: Clinician knowledge increases regarding appropriate screening protocols
  and treatment parameters'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced knowledge creates foundation for improved screening and early
  intervention practices in primary care settings'
