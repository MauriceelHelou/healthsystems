mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Screening coverage below 10% reaches insufficient proportion of at-risk
  drinkers to achieve population-level impact'
- 'Step 2: Low coverage fails to create critical mass of intervention recipients needed
  for measurable aggregate effects'
- 'Step 3: Sporadic screening results in missed opportunities for early intervention
  across majority of risky drinking population'
- 'Step 4: Absence of measurable population-level change maintains status quo of high
  alcohol consumption patterns'
