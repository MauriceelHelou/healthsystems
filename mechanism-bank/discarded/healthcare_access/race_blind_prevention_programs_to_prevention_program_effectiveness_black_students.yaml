category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current college drinking prevention programs are tailored by gender but
  not by race'
- 'Step 2: These programs use normative feedback based on ''typical college student''
  which reflects predominantly White student drinking patterns'
- 'Step 3: Black students show weaker associations with general college student norms,
  suggesting these reference groups are less relevant'
- 'Step 4: Race-specific norms (Black students at same university) are more strongly
  associated with Black students'' drinking than general norms'
- 'Step 5: Prevention programs that ignore race-specific normative influences are
  less effective for Black students'
