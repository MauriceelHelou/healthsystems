mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sites with lower baseline adoption represent settings with greater unmet
  need and larger gaps between current practice and evidence-based standards'
- 'Step 2: Academic detailing in these settings addresses more substantial knowledge
  deficits and practice barriers'
- 'Step 3: Introduction of evidence-based information in low-adoption settings provides
  new actionable knowledge that can be immediately applied'
- 'Step 4: Greater opportunity for improvement at low-adoption sites results in larger
  immediate gains in medication prescribing'
