  node_name: Reduced Face-to-Face Medical Contact After Telephone Triage
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low SES callers may communicate symptoms differently or less assertively
  during telephone triage due to health literacy differences and structural barriers
  to healthcare navigation'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers may unconsciously interpret symptoms from low SES
  callers as less urgent due to implicit bias or communication barriers'
- 'Step 3: Triage algorithms and clinical decision-making may not adequately account
  for social determinants that affect symptom presentation'
- 'Step 4: Low SES callers are less frequently triaged to face-to-face medical contact
  despite potentially equal or greater medical need'
