mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increasing prevalence of opioid epidemic leads to more patients requiring
  opioid use disorder treatment'
- 'Step 2: Clonidine is commonly used to treat or prevent withdrawal in patients with
  opioid use disorders'

  for combined substance abuse patterns'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare providers must prescribe multiple psychoactive agents, increasing
  complexity of abuse potential monitoring'
