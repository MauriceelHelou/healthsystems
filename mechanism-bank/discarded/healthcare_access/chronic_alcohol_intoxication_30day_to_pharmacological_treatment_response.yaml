mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: 30 days of chronic alcohol intoxication creates moderate metabolic and
  immune dysfunction when combined with acute pancreatitis'
- 'Step 2: Heptral/Glutoxim/Mexidol combination normalizes 57.8% and corrects 42.4%
  of altered parameters'
- 'Step 3: Phosphogliv/Hypoxen/Hepon combination normalizes only 12.1% and corrects
  60.6% of parameters'
- 'Step 4: Shorter duration alcohol exposure allows better therapeutic response to
  optimal drug combinations'

    than Phosphogliv/Hypoxen/Hepon in normalizing parameters (57.8% vs 12.1% normalization
