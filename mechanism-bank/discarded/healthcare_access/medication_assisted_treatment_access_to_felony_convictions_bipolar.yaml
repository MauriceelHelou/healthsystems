direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MAT reduces alcohol use which is associated with impulsive behavior and
  criminal activity in bipolar disorder'
- 'Step 2: Improved alcohol use control stabilizes mood symptoms and reduces manic/hypomanic
  episodes linked to risk-taking'
- 'Step 3: Better substance use and mental health management reduces situations leading
  to criminal behavior'
- 'Step 4: Sustained treatment engagement provides structure and support that decreases
  criminal justice contact'
