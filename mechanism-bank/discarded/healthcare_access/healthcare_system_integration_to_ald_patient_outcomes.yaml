mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of integrated care creates fragmented service delivery where alcohol
  use disorder and liver disease are treated in separate clinical silos'
- 'Step 2: Fragmentation leads to missed opportunities for coordinated interventions
  that address both addiction and hepatological complications simultaneously'
- 'Step 3: Patients face barriers navigating between separate services, reducing treatment
  adherence and continuity of care'
- 'Step 4: Absence of integrated pathways limits development and implementation of
  evidence-based interventions specifically designed for comorbid ALD and AUD populations'
