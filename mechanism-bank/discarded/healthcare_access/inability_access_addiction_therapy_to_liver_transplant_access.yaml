direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional transplant criteria require patients to participate in alcohol
  addiction therapy pretransplant to demonstrate rehabilitation potential'
- 'Step 2: Patients with severe alcohol-associated liver disease may be too ill to
  participate in therapy programs or lack access to appropriate addiction services'
- 'Step 3: 75% of centers now recognize inability to participate in addiction therapy
  as valid circumstance for considering early liver transplant'
- 'Step 4: This policy shift removes structural barrier linking addiction treatment
  access to transplant eligibility'
