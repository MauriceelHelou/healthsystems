mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) has become the leading indication for
  liver transplantation in the United States over the past decade'
- 'Step 2: Increased proportion of transplant candidates with ALD creates greater
  demand for limited organ supply'
- 'Step 3: Ethical and allocation debates intensify regarding prioritization criteria
  and resource distribution'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced competition for transplant allocation raises concerns about equitable
  access and appropriate selection criteria'
