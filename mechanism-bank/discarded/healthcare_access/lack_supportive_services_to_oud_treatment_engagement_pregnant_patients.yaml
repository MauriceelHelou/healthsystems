direction: negative
category: healthcare_access

- 'Step 1: OUD treatment clinics fail to provide essential supportive services (no
  clinics offered childcare or transportation)'
- 'Step 2: Pregnant patients and mothers face logistical barriers to attending treatment
  appointments'
- 'Step 3: Lack of childcare and transportation creates structural obstacles to treatment
  initiation and retention'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment engagement increases risk of untreated OUD and associated
  maternal-child health complications'
