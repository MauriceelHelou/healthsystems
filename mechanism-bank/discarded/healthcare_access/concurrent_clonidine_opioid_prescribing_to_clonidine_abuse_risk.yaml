direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare providers prescribe clonidine concurrently with opioids for
  management of opioid use disorder or other conditions'
- 'Step 2: Clonidine reportedly boosts and extends opioid-related euphoria and reduces
  the amount of psychoactive drug needed'
- 'Step 3: Dual availability of both medications creates opportunity for combined
  abuse that produces enhanced psychoactive effects'
- 'Step 4: Underestimation of clonidine abuse potential by prescribers leads to insufficient
  monitoring and safeguards'
