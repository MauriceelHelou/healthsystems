direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Liver transplantation provides complete replacement of diseased liver tissue
  in patients with extensive, nonresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases'
- 'Step 2: Transplantation removes all tumor burden including micrometastases that
  would remain after resection approaches'
- 'Step 3: Complete tumor clearance prevents early recurrence and disease progression'
- 'Step 4: Extended disease-free survival translates to improved overall survival
  outcomes'

  description: The survival benefit of transplant over PVE/resection was most pronounced
    in patients with high tumor load (9+ metastatic tumors or largest lesion ≥5.5cm),
    with 5-year OS of 33.4% vs 6.7%
