direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Jails provide a controlled institutional setting where women with active
  substance use are temporarily accessible to healthcare interventions'
- 'Step 2: Incarceration creates an opportunity window to reach women who have been
  actively using illicit substances and have advanced-stage OUD'
- 'Step 3: Jail-based interventions can identify and engage women with OUD who have
  not been previously reached by community healthcare systems'
- 'Step 4: This forced contact with institutional systems enables treatment initiation
  and linkage planning that may not occur in community settings where women face multiple
  access barriers'
