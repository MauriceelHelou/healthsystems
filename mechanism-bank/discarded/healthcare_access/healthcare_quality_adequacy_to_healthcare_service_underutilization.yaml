direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients who express need for specific doctors or adequate services indicate
  dissatisfaction with or lack of access to quality care at available facilities'
- 'Step 2: Limited availability of preferred or adequate care options creates barriers
  where patients must choose between inconvenient/costly access to quality care versus
  local inadequate services'
- 'Step 3: Mismatch between patient needs and available healthcare quality leads to
  delayed or forgone care when preferred providers are inaccessible'
- 'Step 4: Resulting gaps in care continuity lead to inadequate healthcare service
  utilization for chronic CAD management'
