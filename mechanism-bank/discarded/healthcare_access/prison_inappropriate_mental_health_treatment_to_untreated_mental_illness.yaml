mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prisons are designed for punishment and security, not therapeutic mental
  health treatment environments'
- 'Step 2: Prison conditions (isolation, violence, lack of privacy, restricted autonomy)
  are contraindicated for mental health recovery'
- 'Step 3: Limited availability of evidence-based mental health treatment, therapy,
  and psychiatric care in correctional settings'
- 'Step 4: Mental health conditions remain untreated or worsen during incarceration,
  perpetuating cycle upon release'

  description: Provincial prisons typically house people serving shorter sentences
    or awaiting trial, limiting continuity of care and treatment engagement
