direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IID installation creates mandatory monitoring period with real-time data
  on drinking and driving attempts'
- 'Step 2: Monitoring period provides opportune window for identifying high-risk behavior
  patterns and user typologies'
- 'Step 3: Targeted interventions can be tailored to specific user characteristics
  (motivation, awareness, drinking patterns)'
- 'Step 4: Tailored interventions during this window help develop habits to separate
  drinking occasions from driving behaviors'
