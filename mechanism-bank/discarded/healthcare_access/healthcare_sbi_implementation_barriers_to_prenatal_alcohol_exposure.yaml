mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional SBI for pregnant women has proven difficult to implement in
  clinical settings due to time constraints, provider training gaps, and resource
  limitations'
- 'Step 2: Implementation barriers result in missed opportunities for screening and
  intervention during prenatal care'
- 'Step 3: Pregnant women with unhealthy alcohol use do not receive evidence-based
  counseling and support'
- 'Step 4: Without intervention, alcohol use during pregnancy continues, leading to
  ongoing fetal exposure'
