direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited availability of specialized treatment services for crystal methamphetamine
  use creates geographic and temporal barriers to access'
- 'Step 2: Long wait times, limited service hours, and lack of affordable or free
  services reduce practical ability to engage with treatment'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate service infrastructure particularly affects rural, remote, and
  socioeconomically disadvantaged communities'
- 'Step 4: Structural barriers prevent help-seeking even when motivation exists, leading
  to untreated substance use disorders'

  description: People with lived experience of crystal methamphetamine use demonstrated
    nearly double the odds (OR 1.89) of reporting structural barriers compared to
    knowledge barriers, indicating direct experience with service gaps
