- 'Step 1: Theory-driven program systematically identifies organizational and provider-level
  barriers to alcohol screening and brief intervention implementation'
- 'Step 2: Tailored training and support activities directly address identified barriers
  using evidence-based behavior change principles'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing support over 12 weeks reinforces solutions and builds organizational
  capacity to overcome implementation obstacles'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in perceived barriers enables providers to integrate screening
  and brief interventions into routine clinical workflow'
