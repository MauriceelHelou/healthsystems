direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Separate systems for prenatal care, substance use treatment, and mental
  health create coordination barriers'
- 'Step 2: Insurance changes, provider transitions, or geographic moves disrupt continuous
  care'
- 'Step 3: Regulatory requirements for different MOUD types create access gaps during
  transitions'
- 'Step 4: Despite 87% having only one documented MOUD type, discontinuity across
  trimesters was still observed'
