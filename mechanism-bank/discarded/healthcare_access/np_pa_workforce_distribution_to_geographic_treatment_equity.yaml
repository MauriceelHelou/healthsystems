direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NPs and PAs have greater geographic distribution in rural and underserved
  areas compared to physicians'
- 'Step 2: Policy change enabling NP/PA buprenorphine prescribing leverages existing
  workforce distribution patterns'
- 'Step 3: Increased treatment capacity in rural areas reduces geographic disparities
  between rural and urban treatment availability'
- 'Step 4: More equitable geographic distribution of treatment services reduces structural
  barriers to care for rural populations'
