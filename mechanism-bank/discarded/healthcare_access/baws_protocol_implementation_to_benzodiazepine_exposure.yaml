mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of standardized 5-item BAWS protocol provides structured
  symptom-triggered assessment framework'
- 'Step 2: Abbreviated assessment scale enables efficient clinical monitoring while
  maintaining accuracy'
- 'Step 3: Symptom-triggered approach ensures benzodiazepines administered only when
  withdrawal symptoms meet threshold criteria'
- 'Step 4: Most patients receive minimal or no benzodiazepines (median 0 lorazepam
  equivalents) due to protocol-driven conservative prescribing'
