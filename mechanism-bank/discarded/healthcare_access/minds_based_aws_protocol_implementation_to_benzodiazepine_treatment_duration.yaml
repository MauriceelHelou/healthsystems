mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Standardized MINDS-based protocol provides objective criteria for initiating
  and discontinuing benzodiazepine therapy'
- 'Step 2: Symptom-triggered approach allows for more responsive adjustment of treatment
  based on clinical trajectory'
- 'Step 3: Clear assessment thresholds enable earlier identification of withdrawal
  symptom resolution'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment duration while maintaining adequate symptom control and
  safety'
