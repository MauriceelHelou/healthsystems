- 'Step 1: Integrated alcohol use treatment programs are provided as part of transplant
  care rather than as separate, fragmented services'
- 'Step 2: Patients receive comprehensive addiction treatment alongside medical care,
  addressing both conditions simultaneously'
- 'Step 3: Continuous support and monitoring reduce risk factors for relapse during
  vulnerable post-transplant period'
- 'Step 4: Effective prevention of relapse is achieved through coordinated, accessible
  treatment services'
