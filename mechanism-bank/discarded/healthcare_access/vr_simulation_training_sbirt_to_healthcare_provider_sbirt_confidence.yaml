mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Virtual reality simulation provides safe, controlled environment for practicing
  SBIRT skills without risk to real patients'
- 'Step 2: Repeated exposure to realistic clinical scenarios through simulation builds
  procedural competence and comfort with screening conversations'
- 'Step 3: Structured debriefing sessions allow students to receive feedback and reflect
  on performance, enhancing self-efficacy'
- 'Step 4: Increased confidence and self-efficacy translate to greater readiness to
  implement SBIRT in actual clinical encounters'
