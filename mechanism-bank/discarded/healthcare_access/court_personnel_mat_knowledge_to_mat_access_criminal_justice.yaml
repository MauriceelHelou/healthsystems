direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limited knowledge and stigma about MAT among court personnel restricts
  MAT availability in criminal justice settings'
- 'Step 2: eLearning interventions improve court personnel knowledge and attitudes
  toward agonist medications (buprenorphine, methadone)'
- 'Step 3: Improved knowledge reduces stigma-based barriers to MAT prescribing and
  referrals'
- 'Step 4: Increased MAT referrals by court personnel enable individuals with OUD
  to access evidence-based pharmacotherapy'

  description: At pretest, knowledge-attitude scores were significantly lower for
    agonist medications (buprenorphine, methadone) compared to extended-release naltrexone,
    indicating differential stigma and knowledge gaps by medication type

  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Knowledge-attitude scores improved immediately post-intervention but
    declined to pretest levels at 3 months, suggesting knowledge gains are not sustained
    without ongoing reinforcement
