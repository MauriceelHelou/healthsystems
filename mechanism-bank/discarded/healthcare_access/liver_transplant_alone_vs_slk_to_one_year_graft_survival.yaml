  node_id: one_year_graft_survival

direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with multi-organ failure receive only liver transplant without
  concurrent kidney transplant due to policy restrictions'
- 'Step 2: Untreated kidney dysfunction persists post-transplantation, contributing
  to metabolic complications and graft stress'
- 'Step 3: Renal impairment complicates immunosuppression management and increases
  risk of rejection and infection'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of graft failure occur in LTA recipients compared to SLK recipients
  (80.5% vs 90.4% 1-year survival)'
