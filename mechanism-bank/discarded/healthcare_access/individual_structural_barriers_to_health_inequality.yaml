direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple barriers (stigma, navigation difficulties, deprioritization) decrease
  healthcare access for OST patients'
- 'Step 2: Decreased access leads to reduced healthcare utilization despite medical
  need'
- 'Step 3: OST population has baseline poorer health than general population, creating
  higher healthcare needs'
- 'Step 4: Gap between needs and utilization increases health inequalities between
  OST patients and general population in ageing OST cohort'
