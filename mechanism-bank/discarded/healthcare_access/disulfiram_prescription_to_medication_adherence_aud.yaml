direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Disulfiram requires daily oral administration and produces aversive reactions
  with alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: The medication''s mechanism creates psychological and physical barriers
  to consistent use in community settings without supervision'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare delivery systems in VA settings provide limited structured supervision
  or monitoring for daily oral medications'
- 'Step 4: Lowest adherence rates result (41.3% mean, only 11.9% achieving 80% adherence)'
