direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency departments prioritize acute medical conditions and life-threatening
  presentations over preventive screening'
- 'Step 2: Health professionals view alcohol screening as ''not necessarily your primary
  focus'' given competing demands'
- 'Step 3: Systematic alcohol screening and follow-up is deprioritized in clinical
  workflow and resource allocation'
- 'Step 4: Opportunities for early identification and intervention for harmful alcohol
  use are missed, particularly for patients without obvious acute alcohol-related
  presentations'
