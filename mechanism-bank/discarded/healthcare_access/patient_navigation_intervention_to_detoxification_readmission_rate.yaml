direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patient navigation facilitates successful transition to ongoing substance
  use treatment within 30 days of detoxification discharge'
- 'Step 2: Engagement in sustained treatment addresses underlying substance use disorder
  rather than only acute withdrawal symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Continuity of care prevents relapse cycles that would otherwise result
  in return to acute intoxication requiring detoxification'
- 'Step 4: Reduced readmission rates within 12 months indicate interruption of revolving
  door pattern'
