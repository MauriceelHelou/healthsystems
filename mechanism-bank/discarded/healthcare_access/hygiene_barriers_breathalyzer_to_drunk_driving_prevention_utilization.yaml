direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional breathalyzers require direct mouth contact, creating hygiene
  concerns and potential disease transmission risks'
- 'Step 2: Hygiene concerns reduce user acceptance and compliance with alcohol testing
  systems'
- 'Step 3: Lower utilization of existing alcohol detection technology limits effectiveness
  of drunk driving prevention'
- 'Step 4: Non-invasive spectroscopic technology eliminates contact requirements,
  removing hygiene barriers to adoption'
