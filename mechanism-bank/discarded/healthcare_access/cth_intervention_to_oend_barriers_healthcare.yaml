mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: CTH intervention implements community coalition-based approach to address
  opioid overdose epidemic'
- 'Step 2: Coalition members and stakeholders receive targeted education and support
  to identify and address barriers to overdose education and naloxone distribution'
- 'Step 3: Structured intervention activities reduce institutional and systemic obstacles
  in healthcare and behavioral health settings'
- 'Step 4: Perceived barriers to expanding naloxone access in clinical venues decrease,
  facilitating treatment access'
