mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy present to
  healthcare systems with same primary diagnosis as White patients'
- 'Step 2: Structural barriers including differential referral patterns, implicit
  bias in clinical decision-making, and unequal access to specialized cardiovascular
  centers limit treatment consideration'
- 'Step 3: Black patients experience 35% lower odds of receiving septal reduction
  therapies (including both surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation) compared
  to White patients'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to definitive treatment perpetuates disparities in cardiovascular
  outcomes and quality of life'
