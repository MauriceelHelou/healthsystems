mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates physical health conditions (delayed care,
  COVID infection) and mental health conditions (isolation, stress, trauma)'
- 'Step 2: Worsening health conditions increase symptom burden and psychological distress
  without adequate treatment access'
- 'Step 3: Untreated or undertreated physical and mental health symptoms increase
  vulnerability to substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Increased symptom burden and reduced access to mental health services lead
  to higher rates of recent alcohol or drug use'
