  node_name: Healthcare Desert Status (No Providers Within 25 Miles)
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rural areas have lower population density and smaller healthcare market
  size'
- 'Step 2: Economic viability of multiple healthcare facilities is limited by small
  market'
- 'Step 3: When nursing homes close, sparse provider network leaves large geographic
  gaps'
- 'Step 4: Substantial proportion of rural areas left with no PAC or LTC providers
  within 25 miles'

  description: Rural ZIP codes with no nursing homes in 2018 (vs. those with recent
    closure) had even higher distances to providers, suggesting complete absence of
    facilities creates more severe access barriers

  strength: weak
  description: Home health agencies and hospitals with swing beds provide some alternatives,
    though distances remain elevated even accounting for these services
