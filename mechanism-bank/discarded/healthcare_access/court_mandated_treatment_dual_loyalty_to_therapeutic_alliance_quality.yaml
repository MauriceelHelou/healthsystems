to_node:
  node_id: therapeutic_alliance_quality
  node_name: Therapeutic Alliance Quality
direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court-mandated treatment creates dual role for mental health professionals
  to both care for patients and control/monitor behavior for legal system'
- 'Step 2: Dual loyalty conflict creates tension between therapeutic goals and legal
  reporting requirements, reducing patient perception of confidentiality'
- 'Step 3: Patients experience feelings of betrayal or mistrust when therapists are
  perceived to prioritize legal obligations over patient health needs'
- 'Step 4: Reduced trust and perceived coercion impede development of high-quality
  therapeutic alliance'
