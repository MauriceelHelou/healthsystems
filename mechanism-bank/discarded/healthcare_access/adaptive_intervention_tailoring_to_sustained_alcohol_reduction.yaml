- 'Step 1: Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design allows for
  response-adapted treatment strategies'
- 'Step 2: Preoperative intervention response status determines tailored postoperative
  intervention approach'
- 'Step 3: Non-responders to initial intervention receive intensified or alternative
  postoperative strategies'
- 'Step 4: Adaptive sequencing optimizes intervention intensity to individual need,
  improving long-term alcohol reduction outcomes'
