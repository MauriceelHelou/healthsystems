direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ED presentation indicates lack of access to primary care and preventive
  services, reflecting structural barriers in healthcare access and insurance coverage'
- 'Step 2: ED visits for substance use reflect broader social determinants including
  poverty, unemployment, and housing instability'
- 'Step 3: Lack of integration between ED care and housing/social services fails to
  address underlying structural vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 4: Without coordinated intervention addressing housing and social needs, ED
  patients remain at high risk for homelessness'
