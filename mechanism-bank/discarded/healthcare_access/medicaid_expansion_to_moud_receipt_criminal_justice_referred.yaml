mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medicaid expansion increases insurance coverage among individuals involved
  with criminal justice system who previously lacked coverage'
- 'Step 2: Expanded insurance coverage reduces financial barriers to accessing medications
  for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone)'
- 'Step 3: Treatment facilities and providers are more likely to offer medications
  for OUD when patients have insurance coverage to pay for services'
- 'Step 4: Criminal justice-referred individuals gain access to evidence-based pharmacological
  treatment for opioid use disorder'
