mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structured screening protocol incorporates objective biological measures
  of alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Training equips healthcare professionals to order and interpret Alanine
  Transaminase (ALT) and Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)'
- 'Step 3: Biomarkers provide objective evidence to complement self-reported alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 4: Laboratory testing enables early detection of physiological impacts of
  harmful alcohol use'
- 'Step 5: Increased biomarker utilization reflects systematic integration of biological
  screening into alcohol assessment'
