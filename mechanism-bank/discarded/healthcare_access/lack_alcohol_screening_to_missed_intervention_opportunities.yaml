mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems lack systematic screening protocols for risky lifestyle
  factors including alcohol misuse'
- 'Step 2: Without routine screening, alcohol problems remain undetected during healthcare
  encounters'
- 'Step 3: Undetected problems progress without intervention or referral to appropriate
  services'
- 'Step 4: Patients miss opportunities for early intervention when problems are more
  treatable'
