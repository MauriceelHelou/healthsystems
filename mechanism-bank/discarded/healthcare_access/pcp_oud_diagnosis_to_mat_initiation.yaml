mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: OUD diagnosis during primary care visit occurs within established patient-provider
  relationship, reducing stigma and facilitating treatment discussion'
- 'Step 2: Primary care setting allows immediate treatment planning and prescription
  for those with waivered PCPs, eliminating referral delays'
- 'Step 3: Integration within primary care reduces structural barriers of separate
  specialty appointments, additional travel, and appointment coordination'
- 'Step 4: Immediate access and reduced logistical barriers increase likelihood of
  treatment initiation and engagement'
