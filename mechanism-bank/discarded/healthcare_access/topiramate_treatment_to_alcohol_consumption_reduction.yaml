direction: negative
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Topiramate modulates glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems involved
  in alcohol reinforcement'
- 'Step 2: Medication reduces neurobiological reward pathways associated with alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced reinforcement leads to decreased number of standard drinks per
  drinking day'
- 'Step 4: Sustained reduction in drinking contributes to improved alcohol use disorder
  outcomes'
