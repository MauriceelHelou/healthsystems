mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare access barriers, lack of screening programs, and stigma lead
  to delayed diagnosis of alcohol-associated liver disease'
- 'Step 2: Patients often present at advanced stages including cirrhosis or alcoholic
  hepatitis when disease is already severe'
- 'Step 3: Advanced disease at diagnosis limits treatment options and reduces therapeutic
  efficacy'
- 'Step 4: Limited treatment options for severe disease manifestations result in high
  short-term mortality particularly in alcoholic hepatitis'
