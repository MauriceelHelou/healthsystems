mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Clinical pharmacist conducts daily assessments on all alcohol detox patients
  to identify high-risk cases (history of severe withdrawal, CIWA-Ar score ≥15, or
  polysubstance withdrawal)'
- 'Step 2: Pharmacist performs comprehensive evaluations including substance use history,
  medication history, CIWA-Ar scoring, and pharmacotherapy response monitoring'
- 'Step 3: Pharmacist initiates, modifies, or discontinues withdrawal medications
  for high-risk patients after physician consultation, ensuring appropriate pharmacological
  management'
- 'Step 4: Timely referrals to substance use counselors and acute care facilities
  (48 transfers) occur based on pharmacist assessment, preventing progression to life-threatening
  withdrawal'
