mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care providers in rural areas offer more geographically proximate
  access points than specialized MAT clinics (median 4.2 miles to nearest PCP-MAT
  prescriber)'
- 'Step 2: Regular PCP visits create opportunities for OUD screening, diagnosis, and
  treatment initiation within established patient-provider relationships'
- 'Step 3: PCPs who provide MAT can integrate OUD treatment into ongoing primary care,
  reducing need for separate specialty referrals'
- 'Step 4: Reduced travel burden and integrated care model increases likelihood of
  MAT initiation and sustained engagement'
