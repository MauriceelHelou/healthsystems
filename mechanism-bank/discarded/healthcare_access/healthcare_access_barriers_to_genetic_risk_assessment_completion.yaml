mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare access barriers (including literacy limitations, language barriers,
  and limited healthcare system navigation capacity) disproportionately impact underserved
  populations'
- 'Step 2: These barriers prevent detailed family history collection in primary care
  settings, which is necessary for hereditary cancer risk assessment'
- 'Step 3: Without adequate family history collection, risk assessment for hereditary
  cancer syndromes cannot be completed'
- 'Step 4: This creates a roadblock that prevents appropriate genetics referral and
  cascade to preventive care for hereditary conditions'
