mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Injectable formulation eliminates daily dosing burden compared to oral
  medications'
- 'Step 2: Monthly administration reduces opportunity for missed doses and decision
  fatigue'
- 'Step 3: Healthcare system-delivered injections create structural adherence support
  through scheduled appointments'
- 'Step 4: Sustained medication levels from extended-release formulation maintain
  therapeutic coverage'
