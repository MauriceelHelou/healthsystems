mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smartphone app provides continuous access to computerized cognitive behavioral
  therapy (CBT) content, reducing barriers to therapeutic support beyond traditional
  treatment settings'
- 'Step 2: Text messaging support delivers real-time intervention during high-risk
  situations and maintains therapeutic engagement between traditional treatment sessions'
- 'Step 3: Combined digital intervention reinforces recovery behaviors and coping
  strategies learned in rehabilitation, extending support into daily life contexts'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement with app-based therapeutic content over 6 months reduces
  frequency of heavy drinking episodes in post-rehabilitation period'
