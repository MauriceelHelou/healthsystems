direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medicaid system serves as primary payer for low-income pregnant and postpartum
  individuals, disproportionately including Black birthing individuals'
- 'Step 2: Systemic inequities within Medicaid-financed care create differential access
  to OUD treatment services by race'
- 'Step 3: Black individuals with OUD have lower documented prenatal OUD prevalence
  (0.8%) compared to White individuals (4%), suggesting underdiagnosis and undertreatment'
- 'Step 4: Differential access and diagnosis patterns result in Black individuals
  entering postpartum period with less established OUD care, increasing vulnerability
  to adverse outcomes'
