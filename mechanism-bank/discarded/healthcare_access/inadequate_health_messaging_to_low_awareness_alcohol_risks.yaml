    Risks

  node_name: Low Awareness of Alcohol-Related Cancer and Immune Risks
direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public health campaigns historically emphasize tobacco-cancer links while
  underemphasizing alcohol-cancer associations'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare systems fail to provide comprehensive education about alcohol''s
  impacts on immune function, particularly for high-risk populations'
- 'Step 3: Low awareness persists despite high rates of unhealthy alcohol use among
  vulnerable populations (Veterans, people living with HIV)'
- 'Step 4: Knowledge gaps prevent informed decision-making and risk reduction behaviors
  among populations most susceptible to adverse outcomes'
