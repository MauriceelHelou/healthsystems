direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: FDA-approved medications (disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, extended-release
  naltrexone) are available through VA healthcare system'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare infrastructure determines medication access, monitoring frequency,
  and support services'
- 'Step 3: System-level barriers including pharmacy access, appointment scheduling,
  and clinical follow-up affect medication availability'
- 'Step 4: Overall low adherence across all medications (41-55%) reflects structural
  gaps in treatment delivery rather than medication efficacy'
