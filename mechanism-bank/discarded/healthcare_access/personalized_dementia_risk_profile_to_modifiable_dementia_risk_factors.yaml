mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Participants receive personalized feedback on their specific dementia risk
  factors based on survey responses'
- 'Step 2: Increased awareness of personal risk profile creates motivation for behavior
  change'
- 'Step 3: Knowledge of modifiable risk factors enables targeted intervention on specific
  behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Sustained engagement through repeated exposures reinforces behavior modification'
