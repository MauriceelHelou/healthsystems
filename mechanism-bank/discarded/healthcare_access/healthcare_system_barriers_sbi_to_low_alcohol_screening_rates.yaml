  node_id: low_alcohol_screening_rates

direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Despite evidence-based guidelines and substantial funding for SBI implementation,
  systemic barriers in primary care prevent routine adoption'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare delivery system constraints (time, reimbursement, workflow integration)
  limit provider capacity to conduct screening'
- 'Step 3: Lack of standardized implementation protocols and institutional support
  reduce screening frequency'
- 'Step 4: Only 1 in 6 adults receive alcohol screening, creating systematic gaps
  in early identification and intervention'
