direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Geographic availability and capacity of specialist alcohol treatment services
  determines which populations can access evidence-based pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 2: Specialist services provide clinical assessment, diagnosis of alcohol dependence,
  and evidence-based prescribing of medications like acamprosate'
- 'Step 3: Receipt of acamprosate prescription creates opportunity for pharmacological
  relapse prevention following alcohol detoxification'
- 'Step 4: Prescription receipt is prerequisite for benefiting from medication''s
  therapeutic effects and any adherence support interventions'
