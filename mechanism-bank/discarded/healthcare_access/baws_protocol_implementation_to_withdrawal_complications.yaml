mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Abbreviated 5-item BAWS enables frequent, efficient monitoring without
  excessive clinician time burden'
- 'Step 2: Symptom-triggered dosing prevents both under-treatment (risking agitation/delirium)
  and over-treatment (risking sedation)'
- 'Step 3: Standardized assessment criteria reduce subjective variation in treatment
  decisions'
- 'Step 4: Minimal complications observed: median 0 days of agitation, over-sedation,
  and delirium (IQR 0-0)'
