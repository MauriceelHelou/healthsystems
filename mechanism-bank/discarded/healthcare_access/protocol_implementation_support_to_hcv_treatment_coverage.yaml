- 'Step 1: Availability of established treatment protocols provides evidence-based
  framework for HCV management in PWID'
- 'Step 2: Practitioners who follow protocol recommendations deliver comprehensive
  services across all four domains'
- 'Step 3: Protocol adherence enables practitioners to provide screening, referral,
  treatment and harm reduction to >50% of patients'
- 'Step 4: Increased service delivery improves HCV treatment coverage and moves toward
  WHO elimination targets'
