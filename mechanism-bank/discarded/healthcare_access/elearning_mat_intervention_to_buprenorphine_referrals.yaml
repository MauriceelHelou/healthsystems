mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: eLearning modules provide judges with evidence-based information about
  MAT effectiveness and safety'
- 'Step 2: Educational intervention addresses knowledge gaps and reduces stigma toward
  agonist medications'
- 'Step 3: Judges with improved knowledge increase buprenorphine referrals for individuals
  with OUD under court supervision'
- 'Step 4: Increased referrals expand access to buprenorphine pharmacotherapy, improving
  treatment engagement and recovery outcomes'
