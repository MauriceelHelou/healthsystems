- 'Step 1: Traditional addiction treatment requires abstinence as prerequisite for
  service access'
- 'Step 2: Abstinence requirement creates structural barrier for people with active
  substance use and unstable housing'

  and low engagement'
- 'Step 4: Non-abstinence-focused interventions remove this barrier and increase treatment
  acceptability'
