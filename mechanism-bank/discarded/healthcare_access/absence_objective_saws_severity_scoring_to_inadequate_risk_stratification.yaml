direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: No validated objective severity scoring systems exist for acutely ill patients
  with SAWS'
- 'Step 2: Clinicians cannot accurately risk-stratify patients or determine appropriate
  treatment intensity'
- 'Step 3: Some patients receive insufficient treatment while others receive excessive
  interventions'
- 'Step 4: Increased risk of both under-treatment complications and over-treatment
  adverse events'
