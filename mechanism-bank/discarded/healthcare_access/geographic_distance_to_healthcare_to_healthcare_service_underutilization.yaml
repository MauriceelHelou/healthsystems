direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Living more than 20 km from healthcare facilities creates substantial travel
  time and transportation cost barriers for patients with coronary artery disease
  requiring regular follow-up care'
- 'Step 2: Geographic distance increases the logistical burden of attending routine
  medical appointments, particularly for elderly patients or those with limited mobility'
- 'Step 3: Transportation barriers and time costs lead to missed appointments and
  reduced frequency of healthcare visits'
- 'Step 4: Reduced contact with healthcare system results in inadequate monitoring
  of CAD, medication management gaps, and missed opportunities for preventive interventions'
