direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early liver transplant protocols reduce pre-transplant abstinence requirements
  from traditional >6 months to <6 months for severe alcohol-associated liver disease'
- 'Step 2: Shorter abstinence period provides less time for neurobiological recovery
  from alcohol use disorder and less engagement with addiction treatment infrastructure'
- 'Step 3: Patients receiving transplant with shorter abstinence have incomplete recovery
  from physical and psychological dependence on alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Following transplant, these patients experience higher rates of return
  to harmful alcohol use patterns'
