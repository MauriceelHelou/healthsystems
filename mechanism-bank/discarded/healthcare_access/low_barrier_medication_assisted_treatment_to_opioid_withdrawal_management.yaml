mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency department removes traditional barriers to buprenorphine access
  (lengthy intake processes, insurance pre-authorization, provider DEA waivers)'
- 'Step 2: Patients in acute opioid withdrawal can receive immediate medication-assisted
  treatment without delay'
- 'Step 3: Buprenorphine administration reduces withdrawal symptoms and provides bridge
  to ongoing treatment'
- 'Step 4: Improved withdrawal management and treatment initiation in acute care setting
  facilitates connection to continued substance use disorder care'

  description: Program specifically designed for opioid use disorder; buprenorphine
    is opioid-specific medication, so mechanism applies primarily to opioid withdrawal
    rather than other substance use disorders
