mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: NYCA score incorporating AFP-R demonstrates superior discrimination (C-statistic
  0.66) compared to Milan Criteria (0.59) and French-AFP (0.57)'
- 'Step 2: Net reclassification index shows NYCA improves patient categorization by
  8.1 vs Milan, 12.9 vs French-AFP, and 10.1 vs Metroticket 2.0'
- 'Step 3: Implementation would safely expand access to 453 of 545 patients (83.1%)
  currently excluded by Milan Criteria who have >75% 5-year recurrence-free survival'
- 'Step 4: Similar expansions possible for 69.2% excluded by French-AFP and 76.1%
  excluded by Metroticket 2.0'
