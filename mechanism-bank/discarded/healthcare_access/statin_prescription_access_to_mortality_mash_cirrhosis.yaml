mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Statin therapy is historically underutilized in patients with chronic liver
  disease, creating a treatment gap'
- 'Step 2: Active statin prescription at time of liver transplant evaluation provides
  pharmacological benefit in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis'
- 'Step 3: Statins reduce inflammation and fibrosis progression in MASH cirrhosis
  through lipid-lowering and pleiotropic effects'
- 'Step 4: Reduced disease progression and cardiovascular complications lower mortality
  risk in decompensated MASH patients'
