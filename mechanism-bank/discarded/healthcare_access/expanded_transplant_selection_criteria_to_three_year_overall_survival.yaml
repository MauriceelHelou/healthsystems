direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Expanded selection criteria allow more patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
  to qualify for liver transplantation'
- 'Step 2: Additional patients who would have been excluded under Milan criteria gain
  access to deceased donor liver transplant'
- 'Step 3: These expanded criteria maintain equivalent survival outcomes with minimal
  absolute difference in 3-year overall survival (1.5%)'
- 'Step 4: More patients receive life-saving transplantation without compromising
  population-level outcomes'
