direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ICE provides direct real-time visualization of interatrial septum anatomy
  and catheter position'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced visualization allows precise identification of optimal puncture
  site on first attempt'
- 'Step 3: Successful first-attempt puncture reduces procedural complications and
  duration'
