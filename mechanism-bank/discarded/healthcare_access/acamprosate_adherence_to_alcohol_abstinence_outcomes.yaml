category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular acamprosate consumption maintains therapeutic drug levels that
  modulate glutamate and GABA neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 2: Neurochemical stabilization reduces physiological craving and withdrawal
  symptoms associated with alcohol dependence'
- 'Step 3: Reduced craving and withdrawal symptoms lower the biological drive to consume
  alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Sustained medication adherence supports maintenance of abstinence and reduced
  alcohol consumption over time'
