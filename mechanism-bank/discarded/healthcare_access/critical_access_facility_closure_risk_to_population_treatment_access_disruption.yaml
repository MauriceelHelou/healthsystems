direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Areas dependent on single critical access MOUD facilities have no proximate
  alternative providers'
- 'Step 2: Closure or capacity reduction of critical access facility creates large
  distance increases to next nearest provider'
- 'Step 3: Population-weighted distance gap (difference between closest and second-closest
  facility multiplied by population) quantifies the scale of disruption'
- 'Step 4: Treatment disruption affects ongoing patients and creates substantial barriers
  for new treatment seekers'
