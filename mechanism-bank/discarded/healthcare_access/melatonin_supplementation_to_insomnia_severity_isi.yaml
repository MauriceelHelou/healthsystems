- 'Step 1: Melatonin modulates sleep-wake cycle through chronobiotic effects on circadian
  rhythm'
- 'Step 2: Reduced sleep latency and fewer nighttime awakenings decrease insomnia
  symptoms'
- 'Step 3: Improved sleep continuity reduces perceived insomnia severity'
- 'Step 4: ISI scores decrease reflecting subjective improvement in insomnia symptoms'
