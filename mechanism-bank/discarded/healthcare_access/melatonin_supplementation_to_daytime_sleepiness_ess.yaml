- 'Step 1: Melatonin improves nighttime sleep quality and reduces fragmentation'
- 'Step 2: Better sleep consolidation enhances restorative sleep processes'
- 'Step 3: Improved nighttime sleep reduces daytime sleep pressure and fatigue'
- 'Step 4: ESS scores decrease reflecting reduced subjective daytime sleepiness'
