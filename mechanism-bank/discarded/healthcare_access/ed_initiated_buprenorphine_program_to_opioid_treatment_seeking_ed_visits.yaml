mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: EDIB program implementation specifically targets opioid use disorder by
  offering buprenorphine, an evidence-based medication for OUD'
- 'Step 2: Community awareness develops about ED as access point for opioid-specific
  medication-assisted treatment'
- 'Step 3: Patients with opioid use disorder experiencing withdrawal or seeking treatment
  have new low-barrier entry point to care'
- 'Step 4: Opioid-specific treatment-seeking visits to ED may increase as program
  becomes known resource'
