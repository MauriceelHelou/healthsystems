direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance-related ED visits are rapidly increasing across healthcare systems'
- 'Step 2: Emergency departments lack proportional expansion of addiction service
  infrastructure'
- 'Step 3: Growing patient volume with addiction treatment needs exceeds available
  specialized services'
- 'Step 4: Healthcare teams identify treatment needs (4.3 patients/day in this study)
  but cannot provide timely intervention'
- 'Step 5: Structural mismatch between demand and capacity leaves expanding population
  with unmet addiction treatment needs'
