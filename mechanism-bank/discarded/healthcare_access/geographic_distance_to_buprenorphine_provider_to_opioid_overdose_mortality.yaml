direction: positive
category: healthcare_access
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Greater geographic distance reduces accessibility to buprenorphine treatment
  initiation and maintenance'
- 'Step 2: Reduced access to MOUD means fewer people with opioid use disorder receive
  evidence-based pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 3: Untreated or undertreated opioid use disorder increases continued use of
  illicit opioids including fentanyl-contaminated supplies'
- 'Step 4: Continued illicit opioid use without protective effects of MOUD increases
  overdose risk and mortality'

    and often have limited alternative transportation options, magnifying the impact

  description: In contexts of fentanyl-contaminated drug supply, lack of access to
    MOUD due to geographic barriers creates particularly elevated overdose mortality
