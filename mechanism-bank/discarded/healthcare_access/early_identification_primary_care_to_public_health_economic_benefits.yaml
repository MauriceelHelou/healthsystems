mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Primary care''s unique position enables identification of hazardous and
  harmful alcohol use across diverse age groups'
- 'Step 2: Early detection prevents progression from hazardous use to severe alcohol
  dependence'
- 'Step 3: Intervention at earlier stages requires less intensive and less costly
  treatment approaches'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of alcohol-related health complications reduces healthcare utilization
  and costs'
- 'Step 5: Population-level reduction in alcohol-related harms generates public health
  and economic benefits'
