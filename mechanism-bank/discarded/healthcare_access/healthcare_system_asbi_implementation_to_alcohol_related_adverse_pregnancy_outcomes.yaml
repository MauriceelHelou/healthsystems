mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Healthcare systems integrate evidence-based ASBI protocols into routine
  prenatal care through electronic health records, provider training, and reimbursement
  policies'
- 'Step 2: Systematic screening identifies pregnant persons consuming alcohol across
  all demographic groups'
- 'Step 3: Brief intervention provides counseling and support leading to reduced or
  eliminated alcohol consumption during pregnancy'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prenatal alcohol exposure prevents teratogenic effects and developmental
  harm to the fetus'
- 'Step 5: Decreased incidence of alcohol-related birth defects and developmental
  disabilities'
