mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Groove pancreatitis presents with significant clinical and radiological
  overlap with benign and malignant conditions affecting the pancreaticoduodenal region'
- 'Step 2: Diagnostic challenges lead to delayed recognition and delayed initiation
  of appropriate treatment'
- 'Step 3: Untreated or inadequately treated groove pancreatitis progresses with worsening
  inflammation, fibrosis, and complications'
- 'Step 4: Treatment delays result in increased morbidity, mortality, and complication
  rates'
