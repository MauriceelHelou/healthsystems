direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low income limits access to cardiovascular disease prevention, including
  medications, regular monitoring, and lifestyle resources'
- 'Step 2: Economic disadvantage increases exposure to chronic stress, poor nutrition,
  and environmental hazards that damage cardiovascular health'
- 'Step 3: Stagnation in improvements for circulatory disease mortality particularly
  affects low-income women who lack resources to benefit from medical advances'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated cardiovascular risk factors over the life course result in
  higher mortality rates in older age among economically disadvantaged groups'
