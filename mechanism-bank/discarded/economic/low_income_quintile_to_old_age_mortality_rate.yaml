direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low income constrains access to quality healthcare, preventive services,
  and health-promoting resources'
- 'Step 2: Limited economic resources increase exposure to stress, poor living conditions,
  and health-damaging environments'
- 'Step 3: These accumulated disadvantages result in higher disease burden and mortality
  across multiple causes of death'
- 'Step 4: Stagnation in mortality improvements is most pronounced in lowest income
  groups, indicating structural barriers to health gains'
