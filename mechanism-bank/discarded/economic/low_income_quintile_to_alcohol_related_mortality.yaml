direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Economic disadvantage and financial insecurity generate chronic stress
  and limited social support networks'
- 'Step 2: Low-income neighborhoods often have higher density of alcohol outlets and
  fewer health-promoting resources'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to mental health services and addiction treatment creates
  barriers to addressing alcohol use disorders'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated health damage from alcohol consumption, combined with limited
  healthcare access, results in higher alcohol-related mortality in low-income populations'
