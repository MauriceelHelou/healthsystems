direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher beer taxes increase the retail price of beer, the most commonly
  consumed alcoholic beverage'
- 'Step 2: Price increases reduce affordability and purchasing power, particularly
  affecting heavy drinkers who consume large volumes'
- 'Step 3: Reduced beer consumption decreases frequency and severity of intoxication
  episodes among male drinkers'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of male intoxication reduce incidents of alcohol-fueled violence
  and aggression directed at others'

  description: Beer tax effects on physical harms were only statistically significant
    among men, not in the overall population, suggesting gender-specific consumption
