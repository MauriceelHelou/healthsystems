direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower socioeconomic status creates environmental conditions of resource
  scarcity and reduced access to enrichment opportunities'
- 'Step 2: Resource scarcity shapes cognitive development patterns and decision-making
  processes during critical adolescent brain development periods'
- 'Step 3: These developmental patterns influence executive function and future-oriented
  thinking capacities'
- 'Step 4: Reduced capacity for future-oriented thinking manifests as higher delay
  discounting rates (preference for immediate over delayed rewards)'
