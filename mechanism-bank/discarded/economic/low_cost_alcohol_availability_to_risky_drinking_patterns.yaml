direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Availability of low-cost alcoholic beverages in the market creates economic
  accessibility to alcohol for price-sensitive consumers'
- 'Step 2: Risky drinkers disproportionately purchase low-cost alcoholic drinks compared
  to moderate drinkers'
- 'Step 3: Increased consumption of low-cost beverages enables higher volume alcohol
  consumption within budget constraints'
- 'Step 4: Higher volume consumption contributes to beverage-specific health risks
  and maintenance of risky drinking patterns'
