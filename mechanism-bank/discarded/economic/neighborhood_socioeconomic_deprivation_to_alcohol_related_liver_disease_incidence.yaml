direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic deprivation concentrates populations in neighborhoods with
  higher density of alcohol outlets and marketing exposure'
- 'Step 2: Economic stress and limited resources for stress management in deprived
  areas increase population-level alcohol consumption patterns'
- 'Step 3: Reduced access to preventive healthcare and early intervention services
  in deprived areas delays detection of harmful alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative exposure to chronic stressors and limited economic opportunities
  create conditions for sustained harmful alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Higher rates of alcohol consumption combined with poorer baseline health
  status in deprived populations leads to increased ALD incidence'

    reduces at older ages compared to younger ages, suggesting age modifies the relationship
    between deprivation and ALD risk
