  node_name: Housing Instability and Homelessness
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extractive industries (oil and gas) create volatile economic cycles with
  periods of rapid growth followed by sharp decline'
- 'Step 2: During boom periods, housing costs rise sharply and housing supply cannot
  meet demand; during busts, employment collapses'
- 'Step 3: Vulnerable populations (those with concurrent disorders, Indigenous peoples)
  are displaced by rising costs or lose income during downturns'
- 'Step 4: Economic volatility prevents accumulation of housing security, resulting
  in chronic homelessness for most vulnerable residents'
