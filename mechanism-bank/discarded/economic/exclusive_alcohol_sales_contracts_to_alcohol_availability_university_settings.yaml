mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: University sports clubs sign exclusive contracts requiring them to sell
  only the sponsor''s brand and/or meet sales quotas, creating financial dependencies
  on alcohol revenue'
- 'Step 2: Clubs organize more alcohol-focused events to meet contractual obligations
  and generate revenue through discounted alcohol sales'
- 'Step 3: Increased frequency and scale of alcohol-serving events expands opportunities
  for student alcohol access within university-affiliated settings'
- 'Step 4: Economic incentive structure ensures consistent and expanding alcohol availability
  across university social calendar'
