direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Price differentials between beverage types (created by taxation and market
  factors) create economic incentives for consumption of specific lower-priced beverages'
- 'Step 2: Risky drinkers concentrate consumption in lower-priced beverage categories
  to maximize alcohol volume within budget constraints'
- 'Step 3: Concentrated consumption of specific beverage types creates differential
  exposure to beverage-specific harms (e.g., high sugar content in ready-to-drink
  beverages, different patterns of intoxication)'
- 'Step 4: Population-level beverage-specific health risks emerge based on which products
  are economically accessible in each jurisdiction'

    price differentials, leading to country-specific patterns of beverage-associated
    health risks among risky drinkers

    that price differentials, rather than cultural preferences, drive beverage-specific
    consumption patterns and associated risks
