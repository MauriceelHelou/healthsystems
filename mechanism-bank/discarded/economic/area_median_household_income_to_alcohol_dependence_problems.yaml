direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-income neighborhoods create social environments with higher frequency
  of alcohol consumption opportunities'
- 'Step 2: More frequent drinking increases cumulative alcohol exposure and tolerance
  development'
- 'Step 3: Regular alcohol consumption patterns in affluent contexts may mask problematic
  use due to social acceptability'
- 'Step 4: Sustained higher frequency drinking increases risk of alcohol dependence
  and related problems'
