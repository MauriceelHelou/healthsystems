direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic disadvantage creates chronic allostatic load through persistent
  stress, material deprivation, and limited resources'
- 'Step 2: Cumulative physiological weathering reduces capacity to safely metabolize
  alcohol even at low consumption levels'
- 'Step 3: Economic constraints limit access to higher-quality alcohol products, nutritious
  food to consume with alcohol, and healthcare monitoring'
- 'Step 4: Social and material conditions of disadvantage may shape drinking contexts
  (e.g., drinking without food, episodic patterns) that amplify harm'
- 'Step 5: The combination of biological vulnerability and contextual factors transforms
  even low-level alcohol consumption into a mortality risk'
