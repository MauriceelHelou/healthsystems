direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Price increases make alcohol products less affordable for consumers'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints reduce both the decision to participate in alcohol
  purchasing (participation elasticity) and the quantity purchased by existing consumers
  (consumption elasticity)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced purchasing and consumption of alcohol occurs across disaggregated
  product categories (e.g., different types of alcoholic beverages)'
- 'Step 4: Overall population-level alcohol consumption decreases as shown by negative
  own-price elasticities'
