direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic deprivation limits access to specialized hepatology care
  and liver transplant services after ALD diagnosis'
- 'Step 2: Lower socioeconomic position correlates with delayed presentation and more
  advanced disease stage at diagnosis'
- 'Step 3: Economic constraints reduce ability to access nutritional support, medications,
  and follow-up care essential for ALD management'
- 'Step 4: Higher burden of comorbidities and poorer baseline health status in deprived
  populations reduces survival after ALD diagnosis'
