direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low socioeconomic position creates multiple structural disadvantages including
  limited healthcare access, economic stress, and reduced social capital'
- 'Step 2: These structural factors increase relative vulnerability to alcohol-related
  harm through reduced protective resources and increased exposure to risk environments'
- 'Step 3: Younger populations with low SEP face particularly elevated relative risks
  due to fewer established protective factors and greater susceptibility to alcohol-related
  acute harms'
- 'Step 4: The relative disadvantage manifests as elevated hazard ratios across all
  age groups, with strongest effects at younger ages'
