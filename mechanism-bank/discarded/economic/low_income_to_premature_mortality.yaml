direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low income concentrates in suburban areas with limited access to healthcare
  infrastructure and services'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints reduce access to preventive care, treatment for chronic
  conditions, and emergency medical services'
- 'Step 3: Lack of resources leads to increased exposure to environmental hazards,
  occupational risks, and stress-related conditions'
- 'Step 4: These cumulative disadvantages result in higher rates of premature death
  and years of potential life lost'
