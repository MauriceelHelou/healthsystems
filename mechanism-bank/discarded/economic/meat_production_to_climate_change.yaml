direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Livestock production requires substantial land use, feed production, and
  energy inputs'
- 'Step 2: Livestock farming generates greenhouse gas emissions through enteric fermentation
  (methane), manure management, and feed production'
- 'Step 3: These emissions contribute significantly to anthropogenic climate change'
- 'Step 4: Climate change creates widespread health impacts through extreme weather
  events, vector-borne disease spread, food insecurity, and heat-related illness'
