mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower and middle-income classes have disproportionate representation among
  patients with alcohol-related liver disease (mean age 46.66±10.21 and 47.14±6.36
  years respectively)'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints and limited access to healthcare resources prevent
  early detection and intervention for problematic alcohol use and liver disease'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol consumption without adequate medical intervention leads
  to progressive liver damage and hepatocyte deterioration'
- 'Step 4: Advanced alcoholic liver disease manifests as hepatic encephalopathy with
  impaired brain function and cognitive decline'
