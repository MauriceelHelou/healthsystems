direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Market produces ready-to-drink products (FAB, premixed cocktails) with
  high ABV at low prices in single-serve formats'
- 'Step 2: These products are specifically accessible and appealing to young people
  due to flavoring, packaging, and affordability on limited budgets'
- 'Step 3: Single-serve formats (70% of least expensive brands) facilitate immediate
  consumption and reduce perceived commitment compared to larger volumes'
- 'Step 4: Young consumers face increased exposure to high alcohol doses per drinking
  occasion, elevating acute intoxication risk and long-term harm potential'
