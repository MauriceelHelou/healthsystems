direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomic deprivation creates differential vulnerability to pandemic-related
  stressors and alcohol consumption changes'
- 'Step 2: Most deprived populations experience greater increases in harmful alcohol
  consumption patterns during and after pandemic'
- 'Step 3: Higher consumption combined with existing health vulnerabilities in deprived
  populations leads to disproportionate alcohol-related hospital admissions and deaths'
- 'Step 4: Health inequalities widen as alcohol-related harm concentrates in most
  deprived 20% of population across all future scenarios'
