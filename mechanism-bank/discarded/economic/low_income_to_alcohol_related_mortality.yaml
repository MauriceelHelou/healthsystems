direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower income creates economic stress, social marginalization, and reduced
  access to protective resources'
- 'Step 2: Economic disadvantage concentrates availability and marketing of alcohol
  in lower-income areas'
- 'Step 3: Lower-income individuals experience higher exposure to adverse drinking
  environments and fewer treatment resources'
- 'Step 4: Socioeconomic barriers to healthcare reduce access to alcohol treatment
  and harm reduction services'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative stress and lack of social support increase vulnerability to
  alcohol-related health consequences and mortality'
