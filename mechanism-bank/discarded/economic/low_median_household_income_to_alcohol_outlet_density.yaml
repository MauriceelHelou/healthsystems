direction: negative
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower income neighborhoods experience disinvestment and reduced commercial
  diversity'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol retailers concentrate in lower-income areas due to lower commercial
  rent costs and zoning practices that cluster ''undesirable'' land uses in economically
  disadvantaged areas'
- 'Step 3: Regulatory and political power differentials enable greater outlet proliferation
  in lower-income communities with less organized resistance'
- 'Step 4: High outlet density becomes concentrated and persistent in lower-income
  block groups'
