  node_id: covid19_mortality_rate
  node_name: COVID-19 Mortality Rate
direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Income inequality creates differential access to healthcare resources,
  with lower-income populations experiencing barriers to timely testing, treatment,
  and hospitalization'
- 'Step 2: Unequal income distribution concentrates poverty, leading to overcrowded
  housing conditions and inability to isolate when infected'
- 'Step 3: Lower-income populations disproportionately work in essential occupations
  with higher exposure risk and lack ability to work from home'
- 'Step 4: Inequality produces differential access to quality nutrition, underlying
  health conditions, and preventive care that increase COVID-19 severity and mortality
  risk'
