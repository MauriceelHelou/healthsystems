direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated unemployment bonuses reduce the financial attractiveness of employment
  relative to unemployment'
- 'Step 2: Lower employment incentives reduce the full price (opportunity cost) of
  drug consumption, particularly for illegal drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine'
- 'Step 3: Reduced price barriers increase drug consumption frequency and quantity'
- 'Step 4: Increased consumption of dangerous illegal drugs directly increases overdose
  risk and mortality'
