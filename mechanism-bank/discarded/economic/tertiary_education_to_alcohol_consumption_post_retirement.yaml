direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher educational attainment leads to occupation of higher status jobs
  with greater professional identity and role investment'
- 'Step 2: Higher status positions provide more financial resources available for
  discretionary spending including alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 3: Retirement from higher status positions creates larger role loss and identity
  disruption compared to lower status jobs'
- 'Step 4: Financial resources combined with increased leisure time and role loss
  create conditions for increased alcohol consumption as coping mechanism or lifestyle
  practice'
