direction: positive
category: economic
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low household income among women creates economic vulnerability and may
  intersect with gender-specific stressors including caregiving burden and wage inequality'
- 'Step 2: Economic constraints limit access to women-specific healthcare services,
  addiction treatment, and mental health support'
- 'Step 3: Low-income women face cumulative stress from multiple disadvantages including
  potential partner violence, housing instability, and food insecurity'
- 'Step 4: These structural factors contribute to alcohol-attributable mortality through
  chronic disease progression and reduced capacity for harm reduction'
