direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus smoking regulations exist but students report being unaware of them'
- 'Step 2: Lack of awareness prevents policies from influencing behavior or creating
  social norms against smoking'
- 'Step 3: Unenforced or uncommunicated policies fail to create supportive environments
  for cessation'
- 'Step 4: Low policy awareness undermines potential effectiveness of smoking reduction
  interventions'

  description: Both smoking and non-smoking students report lack of awareness, but
    smokers are more opposed to smoke-free policies, suggesting knowledge may not
    translate to behavior change among current smokers
