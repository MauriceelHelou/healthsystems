- 'Step 1: Australian regulations classify NoLo beverages as soft drinks rather than
  alcohol products'
- 'Step 2: Soft drink classification exempts NoLo products from alcohol advertising
  and sports sponsorship restrictions'

  channels prohibited for traditional alcohol products'
- 'Step 4: Unrestricted access enables widespread sports sponsorship partnerships
  and marketing tactics targeting all ages including youth'
