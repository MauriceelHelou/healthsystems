direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy allowing teenage driving at minimum legal age creates sudden access
  to independent mobility'
- 'Step 2: Access to vehicles enables increased exposure to motor vehicle crash risk
  and expanded geographic range for risky activities'
- 'Step 3: Combination of motor vehicle fatalities and increased access to risky environments
  elevates overall mortality risk'
- 'Step 4: Excess mortality manifests immediately at the age threshold when driving
  becomes legally permissible'
