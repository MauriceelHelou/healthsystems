direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: National maximum trading hour restrictions prohibit 24-hour trading by
  on-premises outlets (bars/nightclubs), limiting hours to between 8am and 4am'
- 'Step 2: Trading hour restrictions reduce alcohol availability during late-night
  hours (4am-6am), even when only 6% of bars/nightclubs were affected due to difference
  between licensed and actual trading hours'
- 'Step 3: Reduced late-night alcohol availability decreases the number of intoxicated
  individuals in public spaces during early morning hours'
- 'Step 4: Fewer intoxicated individuals during late-night hours reduces opportunities
  and contexts for violent altercations'
- 'Step 5: Police calls for service for assaults between 4am-6am decrease gradually
  over time following implementation'

  description: Only 6% of bars/nightclubs were actually affected by the restrictions
    because most did not trade as long as their licensed hours permitted. Despite
    minimal ground-level impact, late-night violence still decreased, suggesting even
    small changes in alcohol availability can have disproportionate effects on violence.

  strength: strong
  description: The effect was specific to the 4am-6am time period (late-night) that
    corresponded to the new restricted hours for on-premises outlets. No effect was
    found for overall night-time violence (9pm-6am), demonstrating temporal specificity.
