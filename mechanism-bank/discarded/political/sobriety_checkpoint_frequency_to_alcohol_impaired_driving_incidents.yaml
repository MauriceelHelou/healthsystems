mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Frequent sobriety checkpoints increase the perceived risk of apprehension
  among potential impaired drivers through direct enforcement presence'
- 'Step 2: Higher perceived risk creates a general deterrent effect in the community,
  reducing decisions to drive while impaired'
- 'Step 3: Reduced impaired driving behavior leads to fewer alcohol-impaired driving
  incidents and associated injuries/fatalities'
