mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fixed checkpoint locations create predictable enforcement patterns at a
  single high-risk location'
- 'Step 2: Drivers learn the fixed enforcement location through repeated exposure
  or information sharing'
- 'Step 3: Drivers strategically avoid the checkpoint by choosing alternative routes'
- 'Step 4: Crime displacement occurs as drunk driving shifts to unmonitored roads'
- 'Step 5: Overall drunk driving rates remain unchanged, resulting in no net reduction
  in accidents'
