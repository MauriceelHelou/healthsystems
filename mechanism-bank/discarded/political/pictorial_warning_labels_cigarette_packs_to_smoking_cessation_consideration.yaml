direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pictorial warning labels (PWLs) on cigarette packs increase visual salience
  and exposure to health risk information among smokers'
- 'Step 2: Frequent exposure to PWLs evokes fear responses regarding health consequences
  of smoking'
- 'Step 3: Fear evocation and new health information trigger cognitive processing
  about smoking risks'
- 'Step 4: Cognitive processing motivates smokers to consider quitting behavior'
