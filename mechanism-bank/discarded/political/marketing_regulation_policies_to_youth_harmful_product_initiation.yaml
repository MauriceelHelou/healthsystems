direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regulatory policies restrict marketing channels and content for harmful
  products (television, radio, cartoons, billboards, sponsorships)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced marketing exposure decreases youth awareness, product appeal, and
  perceived social acceptability'
- 'Step 3: Lower product favorability and increased perceived harm reduce experimentation
  motivation'
- 'Step 4: Population-level initiation rates decline as youth encounter fewer prompts
  and positive associations'
