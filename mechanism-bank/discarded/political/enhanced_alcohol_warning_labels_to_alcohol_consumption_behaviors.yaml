direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government-mandated enhanced warning labels provide health risk information
  at all alcohol purchase points in liquor stores'
- 'Step 2: Increased awareness and processing of cancer risks and drinking guidelines
  raises perceived health risks of alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced risk perception and knowledge of safer consumption levels supports
  changes in purchasing decisions and consumption behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Population-level reduction in alcohol consumption measured through liquor
  store transaction data'
