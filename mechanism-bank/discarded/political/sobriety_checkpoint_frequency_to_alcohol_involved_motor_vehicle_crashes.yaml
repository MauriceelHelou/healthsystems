mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Law enforcement conducts roadside sobriety checkpoints where officers stop
  passing vehicles to check for driver impairment'
- 'Step 2: Increased checkpoint frequency creates general deterrent effects across
  the entire population of drivers through heightened perceived risk of detection'
- 'Step 3: Drivers reduce alcohol-impaired driving behavior due to increased expectation
  of enforcement'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in alcohol-impaired driving leads to fewer alcohol-involved motor
  vehicle crashes'

  strength: strong
  description: Individual checkpoints affect crashes for approximately 1 week. The
    temporal spacing and configuration of checkpoints within an overall program is
    critical - checkpoints conducted over previous 4-7 days show associations with
    reduced crashes.
- name: checkpoint_recency
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Deterrent effect strongest when checkpoints occurred within previous
    4-7 days and 1 week; effect dissipates after approximately 1 week, suggesting
    need for sustained frequency.
