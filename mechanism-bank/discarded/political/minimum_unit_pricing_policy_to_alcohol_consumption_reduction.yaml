direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MUP policy increases the minimum price per unit of alcohol, particularly
  affecting low-cost high-strength products like white cider'
- 'Step 2: Price increase creates economic barrier to purchasing previously affordable
  high-strength alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Some people with experience of homelessness respond by reducing overall
  alcohol consumption or switching away from strong white cider'
- 'Step 4: Reduced consumption leads to decreased alcohol intake among subset of population'
