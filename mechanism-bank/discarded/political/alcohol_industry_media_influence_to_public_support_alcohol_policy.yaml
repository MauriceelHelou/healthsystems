  policy debates (presented in 65.8-86.5% of articles)'
- 'Step 2: Industry arguments dispute, distort, or deny evidence that alcohol causes
  cancer in media coverage'
- 'Step 3: Media framing aligned with industry interests rather than public health
  reduces public understanding of alcohol-cancer link'
- 'Step 4: Reduced public awareness and understanding diminishes public support for
  alcohol warning label policies with cancer messages'
