mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Police agencies in small town/rural areas conduct enforcement against alcohol
  overservice at bars and restaurants'
- 'Step 2: In rural areas, residents often travel longer distances to drinking establishments,
  creating broader geographic impact zones'
- 'Step 3: Enforcement deterrence affects drinking establishments serving wider geographic
  catchment areas'
- 'Step 4: Reduced overservice decreases alcohol-impaired driving across broader geographic
  region (10-mile radius)'
- 'Step 5: Fewer impaired drivers on rural roads results in reduction of fatal crashes
  within expanded geographic area'

  description: The enforcement effect was statistically significant in small town/rural
    communities for the 10-mile buffer model, suggesting broader geographic impact
    of enforcement in rural settings

  description: Effect emerged in 10-mile buffer analysis but not in jurisdiction boundary
    analysis for rural areas, indicating enforcement effects extend beyond immediate
    jurisdiction in rural contexts
