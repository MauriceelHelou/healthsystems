direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State legislatures enact evidence-based alcohol control policies (e.g.,
  taxation, outlet density restrictions, blood alcohol concentration limits)'
- 'Step 2: These policies create structural barriers that reduce physical and economic
  availability of alcohol at the population level'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol availability constrains opportunities for excessive consumption
  across all demographic groups'
- 'Step 4: Population-level decreases in binge drinking occur as environmental constraints
  supersede individual-level factors'
