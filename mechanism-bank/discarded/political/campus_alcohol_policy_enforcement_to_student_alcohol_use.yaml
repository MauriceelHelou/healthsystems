mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus alcohol violations trigger mandatory participation in brief motivational
  interventions (BMIs)'
- 'Step 2: BMI provides personalized feedback, explores student motivations, and discusses
  drinking behaviors in structured setting'
- 'Step 3: Intervention reduces alcohol consumption across multiple metrics (drinks
  per week, typical BAC, binge frequency) at 1-month follow-up'
- 'Step 4: Policy enforcement creates accountability mechanism that channels students
  into evidence-based harm reduction programming'
