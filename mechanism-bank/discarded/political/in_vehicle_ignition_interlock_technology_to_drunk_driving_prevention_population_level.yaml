mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-invasive spectroscopic sensors can be integrated into button-type ignition
  devices in vehicles'
- 'Step 2: Integration creates automatic screening at point of vehicle operation,
  eliminating reliance on individual compliance or enforcement'
- 'Step 3: Compact sensor design enables widespread vehicle deployment across new
  vehicle manufacturing and retrofit applications'
- 'Step 4: Population-level exposure to ignition interlock systems reduces drunk driving
  incidence and associated traffic accidents'
