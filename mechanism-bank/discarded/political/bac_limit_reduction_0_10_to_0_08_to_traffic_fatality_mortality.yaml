mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower BAC limit reduces prevalence of impaired driving through general
  and specific deterrence'
- 'Step 2: Decreased impaired driving reduces frequency of alcohol-related motor vehicle
  crashes'
- 'Step 3: Reduced crash frequency directly decreases number of fatal injuries from
  traffic incidents'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative effect over time produces sustained reduction in traffic fatality
  mortality'
