  node_name: Housing Stability for Severe AUD Population
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: MAPs provide structured alcohol provision within supportive housing settings
  for individuals with severe AUD'
- 'Step 2: Regular, measured alcohol access reduces need for acquisition behaviors
  that destabilize housing (e.g., leaving facility, engaging in risky activities)'
- 'Step 3: Integrated support services address complex needs of individuals who may
  not succeed in standard Housing First or abstinence-based models'
- 'Step 4: Housing retention increases as program design matches the actual needs
  and preferences of the target population'
