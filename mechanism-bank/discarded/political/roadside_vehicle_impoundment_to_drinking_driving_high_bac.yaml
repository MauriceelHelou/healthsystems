direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Seven-day vehicle impoundment added to existing 90-day license suspension
  for BAC>0.08% increases severity of immediate consequences'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced penalties theoretically increase perceived costs of drinking and
  driving at high BAC levels'
- 'Step 3: However, layering additional sanctions on already heavily sanctioned behavior
  may produce diminishing marginal deterrence effects'
- 'Step 4: Drivers already deterred by 90-day suspension are not further deterred;
  those undeterred by suspension may also be undeterred by vehicle impoundment'

  description: The policy added vehicle impoundment to an already existing 90-day
    license suspension. The paper found no general deterrence effect, suggesting that
    adding sanctions to already heavily sanctioned behaviors has limited marginal
    deterrent effect.

  strength: moderate
  description: Drivers engaging in high BAC (>0.08%) drinking and driving may represent
    a population less responsive to legal sanctions, potentially due to alcohol dependence,
    risk-taking propensity, or lack of alternative options
