direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public health teams adopt different approaches to engaging with licensing
  authorities (challenging, supportive, or collaborative)'
- 'Step 2: ''Challenging'' approaches focus on reducing availability and generating
  culture change using evidence-based arguments'
- 'Step 3: More assertive public health engagement influences licensing committee
  decisions and policies toward health-protective stances'
- 'Step 4: Licensing authorities adopt more restrictive policies on new licenses and
  conditions for existing premises'

    of licensing systems, sometimes resulting in diminished focus on public health
    goals when facing resistance.
- name: perceived_achievability
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Some public health teams adopted supportive rather than challenging

    to less restrictive outcomes.
