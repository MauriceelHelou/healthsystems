mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different countries use different concentration units (m/v vs m/m) to report
  blood alcohol concentration, with m/m units being ~5.5% lower than m/v units due
  to blood density of 1.055 g/mL'
- 'Step 2: These unit differences create confusion when scientific evidence is introduced
  in legal proceedings for alcohol-related crimes'
- 'Step 3: Lack of standardization affects calculation and comparison of blood/breath
  ratios (BBRs) across jurisdictions'
- 'Step 4: Inconsistent measurements may lead to errors in enforcement of BAC limits
  and prosecution of impaired driving cases'
