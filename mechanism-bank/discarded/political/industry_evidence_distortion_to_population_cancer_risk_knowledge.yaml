category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry representatives systematically dispute scientific evidence linking
  alcohol to cancer in media statements'
- 'Step 2: Evidence distortion appears in majority of news articles covering warning
  label initiatives (present in articles with industry statements, n=33/43)'
- 'Step 3: Public exposure to disputed or denied evidence creates confusion and uncertainty
  about alcohol-cancer relationship'
- 'Step 4: Reduced clarity and trust in scientific evidence decreases population-level
  knowledge and awareness of cancer risks'
