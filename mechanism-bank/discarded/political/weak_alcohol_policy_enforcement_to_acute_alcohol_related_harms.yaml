mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Limitations in existing alcohol policy create regulatory environment with
  insufficient enforcement mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Weak policy enforcement reduces accountability for serving highly intoxicated
  patrons'
- 'Step 3: Servers perceive limited efficacy of responsible service practices in absence
  of policy backing'
- 'Step 4: Continued service to intoxicated patrons leads to higher levels of disinhibition
  and drunken behavior'
- 'Step 5: Increased intoxication results in disruptive, injurious, and other acute
  alcohol-related harms'
