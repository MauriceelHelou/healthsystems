  node_id: alcohol_related_crash_fatalities

direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: More restrictive state alcohol policies (measured by Alcohol Policy Scale)
  reduce population-level alcohol availability and consumption patterns'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol consumption decreases the number of individuals driving
  with elevated blood alcohol concentrations'
- 'Step 3: Fewer impaired drivers on roadways results in reduced likelihood of alcohol
  involvement in motor vehicle crashes'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of alcohol-involved crashes translate to fewer alcohol-related
  crash fatalities'
