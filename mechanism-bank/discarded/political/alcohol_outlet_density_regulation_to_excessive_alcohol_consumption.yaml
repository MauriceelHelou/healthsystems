direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regulatory policies limit the number, type, or geographic distribution
  of alcohol retail licenses'
- 'Step 2: Reduced outlet density decreases physical availability and accessibility
  of alcohol in communities'
- 'Step 3: Lower accessibility increases barriers to purchase (time, travel, effort),
  reducing convenience of obtaining alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Decreased availability and convenience lead to population-level reductions
  in alcohol consumption'
