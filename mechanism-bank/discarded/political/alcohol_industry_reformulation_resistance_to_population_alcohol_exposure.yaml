direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry shows no inclination toward voluntary large-scale reformulation
  to reduce alcoholic strength'
- 'Step 2: Absence of reformulation maintains high alcoholic strength across beer,
  wine, and spirits products'
- 'Step 3: Continued availability of high-strength beverages sustains high levels
  of alcohol consumption per drinking occasion'
- 'Step 4: Sustained high consumption maintains elevated population exposure to alcohol
  and associated harms'
