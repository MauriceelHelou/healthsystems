- 'Step 1: MLDA laws create legal barriers to alcohol access for individuals below
  the specified age threshold'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol access decreases extreme drinking behavior patterns among
  young men'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of extreme drinking reduce alcohol-related injuries, accidents,
  and health complications'
- 'Step 4: Decreased alcohol-related harms translate to lower mortality rates among
  young male populations'
