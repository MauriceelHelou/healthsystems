mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Size-based classification policies (≤300 m² vs >300 m²) create distinct
  regulatory categories for liquor retailers'
- 'Step 2: Differential classifications enable local governments to apply specific
  planning controls and approval processes to large warehouse-style stores'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced regulatory authority allows communities to limit proliferation
  of large-format alcohol retailers in response to public health and community concerns'
- 'Step 4: Increased local control over the alcohol retail environment enables place-based
  interventions to modify population alcohol consumption patterns'
