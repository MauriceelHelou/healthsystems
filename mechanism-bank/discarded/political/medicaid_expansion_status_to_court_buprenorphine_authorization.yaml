direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Medicaid expansion increases insurance coverage for low-income individuals
  involved in criminal justice system'
- 'Step 2: Expanded coverage reduces financial barriers to buprenorphine treatment
  for court participants'
- 'Step 3: Provider networks expand in response to reimbursement availability, increasing
  local buprenorphine capacity'
- 'Step 4: Courts are more likely to authorize buprenorphine when participants can
  access funded treatment without court-borne costs'
