direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: BDR policy restricts alcohol access for registered individuals without
  addressing root causes of harmful alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Policy does not address structural factors such as poverty, housing instability,
  historical trauma, or social isolation that drive both alcohol misuse and child
  maltreatment'
- 'Step 3: Potential displacement effects or unintended consequences of alcohol restriction
  without support services'
- 'Step 4: Children continue to experience maltreatment in households affected by
  unaddressed social determinants'
- 'Step 5: Maltreatment cases present to emergency departments'
