mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Evidence-informed alcohol warning labels with cancer warnings, low-risk
  drinking guidelines, and standard drink messages are applied to 98% of alcohol containers
  sold in government-run liquor stores'
- 'Step 2: High visibility and varying impactful messages increase consumer awareness
  of health risks associated with alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced risk perception leads to reduced purchasing behavior at the point-of-sale'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol purchases translate to decreased population-level alcohol
  consumption'
