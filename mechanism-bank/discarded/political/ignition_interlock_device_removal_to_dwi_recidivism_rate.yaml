category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ignition interlock devices (IIDs) are mandated as part of judicial penalties
  for DWI offenders, creating a physical barrier to drinking and driving'
- 'Step 2: While IIDs are installed, they mechanically prevent vehicle operation when
  alcohol is detected, reducing immediate DWI risk'
- 'Step 3: Once the mandated IID period ends and devices are removed, the mechanical
  barrier is eliminated'
- 'Step 4: Without continued support or intervention after IID removal, offenders
  experience increased DWI recidivism rates'
- 'Step 5: This creates a gap in structural prevention measures, leading to increased
  morbidity and mortality from impaired driving'
