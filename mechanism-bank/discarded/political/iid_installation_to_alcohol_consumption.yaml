direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IID installation does not directly constrain alcohol consumption but may
  indirectly influence drinking patterns through behavioral coupling'
- 'Step 2: Awareness of device monitoring may create psychological deterrent to drinking
  in situations where driving might be necessary'
- 'Step 3: Practical constraints of IID testing requirements may discourage drinking
  before planned vehicle use'
- 'Step 4: However, abstract indicates total alcohol use ''did not change much'' after
  initial post-arrest reduction, suggesting minimal additional effect on consumption'
