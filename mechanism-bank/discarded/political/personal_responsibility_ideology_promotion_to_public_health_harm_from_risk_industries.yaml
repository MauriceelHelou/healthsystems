direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: SAPROs hegemonically promote personal responsibility narratives that frame
  health as an individual choice rather than structural issue'
- 'Step 2: Personal responsibility framing legitimizes neoliberal governance approaches
  that minimize state regulation of harmful industries'
- 'Step 3: Absence of structural regulation allows continued production and marketing
  of harmful products (alcohol, tobacco, sugar, gambling)'
- 'Step 4: Population-level exposure to industry harms continues unabated, resulting
  in sustained health burdens at the societal level'
