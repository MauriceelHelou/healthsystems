  node_name: Violent Crime Rate
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Statutory reduction in bar/tavern operating hours (from 20 to 13 hours
  per day) decreases temporal availability of alcohol sales'
- 'Step 2: Reduced late-night alcohol availability limits congregation of people during
  high-risk hours (8pm-4am)'
- 'Step 3: Decreased late-night alcohol consumption and social congregation reduces
  opportunities for violence-triggering interactions'
- 'Step 4: Lower density of intoxicated individuals in public spaces during late-night
  hours reduces violent crime incidents (homicide, robbery, assault, rape)'

- name: temporal_pattern
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: No immediate level change observed in first month after implementation,
    but sustained slope decrease of 23% per year after initial month, suggesting cumulative
    effects over time
- name: baseline_neighborhood_characteristics
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Control areas were matched on baseline crime rate, alcohol outlet density,
    and neighborhood disadvantage score, suggesting the effect operates independently
    of these structural factors
- name: spatial_proximity_to_outlets
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Effects measured within 800-ft buffer around bars/taverns, indicating
    localized geographic concentration of crime reduction near alcohol outlets
