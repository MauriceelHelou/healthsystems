direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher intensity or frequency of enforcement operations was measured as
  intervention dosage'
- 'Step 2: Contrary to expected deterrence theory, higher dosage showed statistically
  significant effect in unexpected direction (potentially increasing crashes)'
- 'Step 3: Possible mechanisms include community resistance to perceived over-policing,
  displacement of drinking/driving to less monitored times or locations, or implementation
  quality issues at high intensity'
- 'Step 4: Alternative explanation: cities with higher baseline crash rates may have
  received higher dosage (reverse causation), or threshold effects where optimal enforcement
  exists below maximum intensity'
