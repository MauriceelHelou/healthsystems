direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State legislation mandates ignition interlock devices for segments of high-risk
  drunk driving offenders (e.g., repeat offenders)'
- 'Step 2: Targeted offenders have devices installed that prevent vehicle operation
  above predetermined BAC threshold'
- 'Step 3: Technology creates physical barrier to recidivism among highest-risk population
  segment'
- 'Step 4: After sufficient implementation period (2+ years), population-level reduction
  in alcohol-involved fatal crashes becomes detectable'

  description: Laws show detectable effects on crash reduction only after 2 years
    of implementation, suggesting time needed for sufficient coverage and compliance
- name: law_comprehensiveness
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Targeted high-risk laws show weaker effects compared to all-offender
    laws, as they cover smaller proportion of drunk driving population
