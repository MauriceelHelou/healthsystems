- 'Step 1: Image-and-text health warning labels depicting diseases linked to excess
  energy intake are applied to energy-dense snack food packaging'
- 'Step 2: Graphic images showing health consequences (bowel cancer, heart disease)
  trigger affective responses when viewing food products'
- 'Step 3: Visual depiction of disease outcomes increases salience of health risks
  associated with excessive consumption of energy-dense foods'
- 'Step 4: Labels depicting bowel cancer generate highest negative emotional arousal
  among tested conditions'
