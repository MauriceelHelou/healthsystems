mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traditional DUI risk assessment uses single-scale approach applied equally
  to all offenders'
- 'Step 2: Gender-specific models identify distinct risk factor sets with minimal
  overlap between sexes'
- 'Step 3: Tailored assessment improves predictive validity for identifying high-risk
  individuals by gender'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced prediction enables more efficient resource allocation and targeted
  interventions'
- 'Step 5: Improved intervention matching reduces 12-month recidivism rates'
