- 'Step 1: Police agencies implement comprehensive high-intensity alcohol-impaired
  driving enforcement (combination of multiple strategies)'
- 'Step 2: Multi-strategy enforcement approach creates layered deterrent effects targeting
  both supply-side (overservice) and demand-side (impaired drivers)'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive enforcement increases perceived risk of detection across
  multiple points in drinking-driving pathway'
- 'Step 4: In rural settings with geographic dispersion, comprehensive approach necessary
  to create effective deterrence across broader area'
- 'Step 5: Cumulative enforcement effects reduce alcohol-impaired driving and associated
  fatal crashes'
