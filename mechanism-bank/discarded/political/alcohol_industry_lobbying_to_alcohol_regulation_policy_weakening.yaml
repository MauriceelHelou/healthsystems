direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry actors employ coordinated lobbying, framing, and litigation
  strategies to oppose alcohol regulations'
- 'Step 2: Industry presents dominant and cohesive voice citing economic impacts,
  illicit trade concerns, and questioning evidence on regulatory benefits'
- 'Step 3: Industry opposition creates political pressure that undermines policy momentum
  for alcohol restrictions'
- 'Step 4: Without effective counter-voice from pro-regulation actors, industry influence
  prevents translation of COVID-19 emergency measures into sustainable policy changes'
