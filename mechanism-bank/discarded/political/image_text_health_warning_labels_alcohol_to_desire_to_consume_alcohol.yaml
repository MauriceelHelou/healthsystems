category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Image-and-text health warning labels displaying graphic health consequences
  are placed on alcoholic drink packaging'
- 'Step 2: Visual cues depicting severe health outcomes (particularly bowel cancer)
  create aversive associations with the product'
- 'Step 3: Negative emotional arousal and increased risk salience reduce product appeal
  and attractiveness'
- 'Step 4: Decreased appeal translates to reduced desire to consume the labeled alcoholic
  product'
