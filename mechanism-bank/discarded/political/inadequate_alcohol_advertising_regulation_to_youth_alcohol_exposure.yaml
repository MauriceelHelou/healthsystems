  node_name: Youth Exposure to Alcohol Advertising
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Self-regulatory codes (ABAC) lack comprehensive provisions to restrict
  alcohol advertising content and placement that appeals to youth'
- 'Step 2: Industry-administered codes fail to capture advertisements featuring youth-appealing
  content, with only 36% of violating ads captured by ABAC compared to 94% by stricter
  AARB Code'
- 'Step 3: Weak regulatory enforcement allows 88% of advertisements to be placed in
  locations or broadcast at times where young people are likely to be exposed'
- 'Step 4: High volume of inadequately regulated alcohol advertisements reaches youth
  audiences through multiple channels'
