  node_name: Strength of Public Health Alcohol Policy
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry actors employ obstruction through participation tactics,
  engaging in policy consultation processes to delay and weaken proposed public health
  measures'
- 'Step 2: Industry builds coalitions and mobilizes proxy organizations (retailers,
  hospitality sector) to amplify opposition voices and create appearance of broad-based
  resistance'
- 'Step 3: Industry deploys extensive political and economic resources through lobbying
  activities to pressure legislators and influence policy content'
- 'Step 4: These combined tactics result in provisions being excluded, amendments
  weakening legislation, and delays in policy implementation that reduce protective
  effects on population health'
