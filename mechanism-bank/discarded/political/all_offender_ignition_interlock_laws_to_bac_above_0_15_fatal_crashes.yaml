mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State legislation mandates ignition interlock devices for all convicted
  drunk driving offenders'
- 'Step 2: Interlock devices prevent vehicle operation when blood alcohol content
  exceeds threshold, blocking high-BAC driving attempts'
- 'Step 3: Comprehensive all-offender coverage creates prevention across spectrum
  of intoxication levels, including severely intoxicated drivers'
- 'Step 4: Technological barrier reduces extremely high-BAC driving events, decreasing
  fatal crashes involving severely intoxicated drivers'
