mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Legal permission to drive at minimum age provides access to motor vehicle
  operation without commensurate driving experience'
- 'Step 2: Inexperienced teenage drivers face higher crash risk due to underdeveloped
  hazard perception and vehicle control skills'
- 'Step 3: Structural conditions including high-speed road infrastructure and vehicle
  design amplify consequences of inexperienced driving'
- 'Step 4: Motor vehicle fatalities concentrate immediately following age threshold
  when driving becomes legally permitted'
