direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Only 63% of products display warning labels and 88% are placed on back
  of containers'
- 'Step 2: Limited uptake and poor visibility reduce consumer exposure to pregnancy-alcohol
  risk information'
- 'Step 3: Reduced information exposure limits awareness and knowledge of fetal alcohol
  harms among pregnant women and women of childbearing age'
- 'Step 4: Lower awareness diminishes informed decision-making capacity regarding
  alcohol consumption during pregnancy'

    greatest information gap for consumers of this product category.
- name: policy_enforcement_mechanisms
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Lack of requirements for all products for sale (versus only newly labeled
    products) and lack of prominent placement mandates weaken policy effectiveness.
