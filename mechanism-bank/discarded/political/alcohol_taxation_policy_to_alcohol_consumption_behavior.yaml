direction: negative

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of taxes on alcohol products increases the retail price
  of alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices create economic barriers to alcohol purchase, particularly

  consumption at population level'
- 'Step 4: Reduced consumption decreases exposure to alcohol-related health and social
  harms'
