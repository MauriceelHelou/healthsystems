mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Strict speeding law enforcement creates regulatory environment that deters
  excessive vehicle speeds'
- 'Step 2: Lower vehicle speeds reduce kinetic energy in collisions and increase driver
  reaction time'
- 'Step 3: Reduced collision severity and frequency decrease fatal road traffic accidents'
- 'Step 4: Population-level death rates from road traffic accidents decline'
