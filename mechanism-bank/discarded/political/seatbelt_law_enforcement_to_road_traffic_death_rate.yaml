- 'Step 1: Mandatory seatbelt laws with strong enforcement create legal requirements
  for vehicle occupant restraint'
- 'Step 2: Increased seatbelt compliance rates result from enforcement through fines
  and penalties'
- 'Step 3: Seatbelt use reduces biomechanical injury severity during collisions by
  distributing impact forces and preventing ejection'
- 'Step 4: Lower fatality rates in crashes lead to reduced population-level traffic
  death rates'
