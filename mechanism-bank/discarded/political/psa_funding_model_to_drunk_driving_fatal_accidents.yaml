  node_name: Drunk-Driving Fatal Accident Rate
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Dependence on donated air time limits total volume of PSA exposure and
  restricts scheduling to less desirable (non-prime) time slots'
- 'Step 2: Lower overall exposure and suboptimal timing reduces population reach and
  frequency of anti-drunk driving messaging'
- 'Step 3: Insufficient message saturation limits ability to shift social norms and
  awareness around drunk-driving risks at population level'
- 'Step 4: Modest or limited population-level behavior change results in smaller reductions
  in drunk-driving fatal accident rates than would be achievable with well-funded
  campaigns'
