direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State alcohol licensing policies establish regulations for where and how
  many alcohol outlets can operate in specific areas'
- 'Step 2: Policies that allow high density or lack restrictions on outlet concentration
  enable clustering in specific neighborhoods'
- 'Step 3: In absence of protective zoning, outlets concentrate in areas with lower
  property values and weaker political opposition (often historically disadvantaged
  areas)'
- 'Step 4: Concentration creates high neighborhood alcohol outlet density, particularly
  in formerly redlined communities'

  description: State policies that allow high alcohol outlet density have stronger
    effects in historically redlined communities, where legacy of disinvestment and
    reduced political power creates less resistance to outlet concentration
