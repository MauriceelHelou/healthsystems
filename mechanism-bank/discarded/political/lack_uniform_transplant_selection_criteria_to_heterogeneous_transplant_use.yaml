mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of uniform, evidence-based selection criteria for early liver transplantation
  in alcoholic hepatitis creates policy gaps'
- 'Step 2: Different transplant centers and countries apply varying standards and
  eligibility requirements'
- 'Step 3: Geographic and institutional variation in selection criteria leads to inconsistent
  access to potentially life-saving transplantation'
- 'Step 4: Heterogeneous use results in inequitable outcomes where similar patients
  receive different treatment based on location rather than medical need'
