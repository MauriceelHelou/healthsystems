- 'Step 1: Stricter 0.08 BAC limit increases legal penalties for drunk drivers who
  remain at scene'
- 'Step 2: Higher perceived consequences of staying at crash scene create perverse
  incentive structure'

  of BAC testing and prosecution'
- 'Step 4: Increased flight behavior results in higher hit-and-run fatality rates
  due to delayed emergency response'
