direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol companies provide CSR funding to government-owned teaching hospitals,
  community hospitals, faith-based institutions, and educational facilities'
- 'Step 2: Recipient institutions become financially dependent on or grateful for
  industry support, creating conflicts of interest'
- 'Step 3: Health and educational institutions that should advocate for alcohol control
  policies become reluctant to criticize industry funders'
- 'Step 4: Civil society and institutional voice for evidence-based alcohol policy
  is silenced or weakened, reducing pressure for effective regulation'
