- 'Step 1: Warning label provides general abstinence message without educating about
  standard drinks or alcohol equivalence across beverage types'
- 'Step 2: Absence of information about pure alcohol content allows cultural beliefs
  about beverage hierarchy to persist'
- 'Step 3: Women retain pre-existing misconceptions that spirits are more harmful
  due to higher alcohol concentration per volume'
- 'Step 4: Lack of knowledge about standard drink equivalence leads to incorrect risk
  perception regarding wine and beer consumption'
