direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice reforms reduce overall incarceration rates by diverting
  lower-risk individuals from prison'
- 'Step 2: Individuals without complex mental health needs are more successfully diverted
  to alternative programs'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with mental health disorders face greater barriers to diversion
  due to lack of community-based mental health infrastructure'
- 'Step 4: Prison population becomes increasingly concentrated with individuals having
  mental health disorders despite smaller overall population'
