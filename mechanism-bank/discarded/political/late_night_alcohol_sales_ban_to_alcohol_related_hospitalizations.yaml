direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy restricts availability of alcoholic beverages from off-premise outlets
  (kiosks, petrol stations, supermarkets) during late-night hours (10pm-5am)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced temporal access to alcohol during high-risk drinking hours limits
  opportunities for continued alcohol consumption during late-night periods'
- 'Step 3: Lower alcohol consumption during late-night hours reduces instances of
  acute alcohol intoxication and binge drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: Decreased acute alcohol intoxication events result in fewer alcohol-related
  hospital admissions requiring emergency medical care'

  description: The policy effect is concentrated among adolescents and young adults,
    suggesting this age group is particularly responsive to temporal restrictions
    on alcohol availability and more likely to use off-premise outlets during late-night
    hours.
- name: outlet_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: The ban specifically targets off-premise outlets (kiosks, petrol stations,
    supermarkets) rather than on-premise establishments (bars, restaurants), indicating
    that late-night off-premise purchases are a key contributor to high-risk drinking
    patterns.
