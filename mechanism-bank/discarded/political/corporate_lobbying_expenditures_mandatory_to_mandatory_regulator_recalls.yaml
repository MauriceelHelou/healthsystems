direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Automotive companies use lobbying to build relationships with regulatory
  agencies and influence regulatory decision-making processes'
- 'Step 2: Lobbying creates institutional pressures and legitimacy that reduce regulatory
  agencies'' willingness or capacity to mandate recalls'
- 'Step 3: Reduced mandatory recalls mean regulatory agencies fail to enforce product
  safety standards, allowing defective vehicles to remain on roads'
- 'Step 4: Unrecalled defective vehicles pose elevated crash, injury, and fatality
  risks, with greatest impact on vulnerable populations who drive older vehicles and
  have less access to safety information'

moderators:
- name: defect_severity
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher defect severity moderates the lobbying-mandatory recall relationship,
    with lobbying less effective at preventing mandatory recalls when defects pose
    greater safety risks
- name: media_coverage
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Media coverage moderates the lobbying effect on mandatory recalls;
    public scrutiny through media reduces lobbying effectiveness in preventing regulatory
    action, with full indirect moderation through interaction with defect severity
