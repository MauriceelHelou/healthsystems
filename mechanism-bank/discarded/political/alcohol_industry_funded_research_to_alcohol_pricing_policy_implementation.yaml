mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry funds economists to publish papers disputing research
  consensus on pricing/taxation effectiveness'
- 'Step 2: Industry-sponsored publications enter peer-reviewed literature, creating
  apparent scientific controversy about evidence-based pricing policies'
- 'Step 3: These publications provide resources for alcohol industry actors to oppose
  pricing measures in policy debates'
- 'Step 4: Policy makers encounter conflicting scientific evidence, reducing likelihood
  of implementing evidence-based pricing/taxation measures'
