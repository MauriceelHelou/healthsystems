direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Removal of mandatory license suspension laws eliminates a key legal deterrent
  and consequence for underage alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Reduced consequences weaken the enforcement framework linking alcohol violations
  to driving privileges for youth'
- 'Step 3: Youth may engage in more frequent underage alcohol use and/or drinking
  and driving behaviors due to reduced penalty severity'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol-involved driving among young inexperienced drivers leads
  to higher rates of fatal motor vehicle collisions'
