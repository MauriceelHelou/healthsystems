  presence in public spaces and social settings'
- 'Step 2: Reduced time spent outdoors and in community spaces decreases exposure

- 'Step 3: Lower rates of public interaction reduce opportunities for violent encounters
  involving weapons'
- 'Step 4: Emergency department admissions for penetrating injuries (stab wounds,
  gunshot wounds) in geriatric population decline'
