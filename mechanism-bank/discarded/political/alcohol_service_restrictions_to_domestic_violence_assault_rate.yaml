direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restrictions on alcohol service modify the drinking environment by limiting
  how alcohol is served, promoted, and consumed in late-night venues'
- 'Step 2: Modified service practices reduce the pace and volume of alcohol consumption,
  including restrictions on drink types, service methods, and promotional activities'
- 'Step 3: Lower overall alcohol consumption and reduced peak blood alcohol levels
  result from environmental modifications that make excessive drinking less accessible'
- 'Step 4: Reduced intoxication translates to fewer domestic violence incidents as
  alcohol-related disinhibition and aggression are minimized'
