direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry actors (producers, distributors, trade associations) deploy
  arguments through press coverage to contest pregnancy warning measures'
- 'Step 2: Industry frames warnings as questionable, ineffective, and economically
  counterproductive through sustained media campaigns'
- 'Step 3: Lobbying succeeds in blocking expanded warning labels in 2018 despite successful
  implementation in 2007, limiting public health messaging'
- 'Step 4: Reduced visibility and delayed implementation of warnings limits population-level
  awareness of pregnancy alcohol risks'
