  of what constitutes a conflict of interest in alcohol policy'
- 'Step 2: Lack of consensus on conflict of interest definitions and evaluation criteria
  creates ambiguity in governance frameworks'
- 'Step 3: Ambiguity allows for inconsistent application of conflict of interest management
  policies across different contexts and actors'
- 'Step 4: Inconsistent management creates opportunities for industry influence while
  appearing to address conflict of interest concerns, undermining systematic public
  health protections'
