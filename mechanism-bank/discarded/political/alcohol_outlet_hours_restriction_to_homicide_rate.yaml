direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy-mandated reduction in bar/tavern operating hours eliminates late-night/early
  morning alcohol sales (2am-6am period)'
- 'Step 2: Reduced temporal window for alcohol consumption during peak violence hours
  decreases density of intoxicated individuals in public spaces'
- 'Step 3: Lower concentration of alcohol-impaired individuals reduces likelihood
  of lethal interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 4: Decreased homicide incidents in areas proximate to alcohol outlets during
  high-risk nighttime hours'
