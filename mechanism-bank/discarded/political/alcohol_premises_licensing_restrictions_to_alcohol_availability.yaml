  under specific conditions'
- 'Step 2: Public health teams can influence licensing policies and decisions to restrict
  new licenses or impose conditions'
- 'Step 3: Reduced licensing approval or stricter conditions limits the number and
  density of alcohol retail outlets'
- 'Step 4: Lower outlet density reduces physical and economic access to alcohol in
  communities'

- name: public_health_approach_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Teams taking a 'challenging' approach focused on reducing availability
    and generating longer-term culture change, citing international evidence on links
    between availability and alcohol-related harms. This was more effective at restricting
    licensing than 'supportive' or 'collaborative' approaches.
- name: licensing_system_constraints
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: Within current licensing systems, alcohol availability may be contained
    but cannot be reduced, because existing businesses cannot be closed on availability
    grounds. This structural constraint limits effectiveness of public health interventions.
- name: jurisdiction_type
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: All public health stakeholders in Scotland took a 'challenging' approach,
    while only some in England did, suggesting Scottish licensing framework may better
    enable restrictive policies.
