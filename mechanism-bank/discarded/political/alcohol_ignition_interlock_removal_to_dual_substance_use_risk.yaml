direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: During interlock installation, individuals reduce alcohol use due to device
  constraints while increasing cannabis use as a substitute'
- 'Step 2: Upon interlock removal, the structural barrier to alcohol use is eliminated'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol consumption is expected to return to pre-interlock levels as the
  technological constraint is removed'
- 'Step 4: Elevated cannabis use patterns established during the interlock period
  may persist after device removal'
- 'Step 5: Combined return to baseline alcohol use and continued cannabis use creates
  dual substance use pattern with increased crash risk'
