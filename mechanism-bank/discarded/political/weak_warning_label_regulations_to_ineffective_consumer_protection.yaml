direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public policy officials establish consumer protection requirements for
  gambling warning labels but lack specific standards for wording, font size, placement,
  and format'
- 'Step 2: This regulatory gap allows gambling operators discretion in how they implement
  warning labels'
- 'Step 3: Operators overwhelmingly choose sludge strategies that minimize visibility
  and comprehension of warnings'
- 'Step 4: The consumer protection measure fails to achieve its intended purpose of
  informing gamblers about risks'
