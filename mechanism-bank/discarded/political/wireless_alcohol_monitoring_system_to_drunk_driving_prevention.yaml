mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Engineering systems detect alcohol concentration in driver''s breath using
  smart sensors'
- 'Step 2: Data is transmitted wirelessly to remote monitoring locations (law enforcement,
  fleet managers, or monitoring authorities)'
- 'Step 3: Remote monitoring enables real-time surveillance and accountability for
  driver sobriety status'
- 'Step 4: Knowledge of external monitoring creates deterrent effect and enables intervention
  before vehicle operation'
- 'Step 5: Combination of detection and external accountability reduces instances
  of drunk driving attempts'
