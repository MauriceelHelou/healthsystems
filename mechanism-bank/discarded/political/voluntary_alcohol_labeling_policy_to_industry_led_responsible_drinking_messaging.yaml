direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Voluntary systems allow alcohol industry to self-regulate content and framing
  of health-related messages on products'
- 'Step 2: Industry prioritizes vague ''responsible consumption'' messages (appearing
  on 73% of containers) that do not specify health risks or vulnerable populations'
- 'Step 3: These industry messages occupy label space and consumer attention, competing
  with specific health warnings'
- 'Step 4: Responsible drinking framing shifts focus from product risks to individual
  responsibility, benefiting industry by maintaining consumption while appearing health-conscious'
