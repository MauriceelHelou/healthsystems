mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Criminal justice policies and practices restrict MAT access in courts,
  jails, and probation settings'
- 'Step 2: Institutional stigma and limited knowledge among CJ personnel perpetuate
  MAT restrictions'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with OUD under CJ supervision face barriers to accessing evidence-based
  pharmacotherapy'
- 'Step 4: Restricted MAT access reduces treatment engagement, increases relapse risk,
  and worsens health outcomes for criminalized populations'
