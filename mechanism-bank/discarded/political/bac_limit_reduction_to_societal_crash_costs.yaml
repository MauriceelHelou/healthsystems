mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower BAC limit reduces frequency of alcohol-impaired crashes through legal
  deterrence'
- 'Step 2: Decreased crash incidence reduces direct costs including medical expenses,
  emergency response, property damage, and legal costs'
- 'Step 3: Reduced fatalities and injuries decrease indirect costs including lost
  productivity, long-term care, and quality of life losses'
- 'Step 4: Combined reductions in direct and indirect costs lower total societal burden'
