direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State-mandated RBS training policies establish legal requirements for alcohol
  servers to recognize signs of intoxication'
- 'Step 2: Training programs educate servers on legal liability and techniques for
  refusing service to intoxicated customers'
- 'Step 3: Well-established training policies create institutional norms and enforcement
  mechanisms that support server refusal decisions'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol service to intoxicated patrons decreases the frequency
  of overservice events in licensed establishments'
