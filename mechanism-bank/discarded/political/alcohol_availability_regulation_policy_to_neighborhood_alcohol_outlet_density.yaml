mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Government alcohol regulation policies determine licensing requirements,
  outlet density limits, and zoning restrictions for alcohol retail'
- 'Step 2: Stricter regulation policies reduce the number of permits granted and impose
  spatial restrictions on outlet locations'
- 'Step 3: Reduced licensing approval rates and spatial constraints lower the total
  number of off-premise alcohol outlets in communities'
- 'Step 4: Lower outlet density increases drive times and reduces physical accessibility
  to alcohol at the neighborhood level'

  description: Local built environment factors (urban density, transportation infrastructure,
    commercial zoning patterns) moderate how alcohol availability policies affect
    actual physical access to outlets and population-level consumption.
