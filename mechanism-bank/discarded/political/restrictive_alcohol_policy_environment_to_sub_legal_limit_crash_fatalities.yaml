direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: More restrictive alcohol policies reduce overall population exposure to
  alcohol through multiple regulatory mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability decreases the prevalence of driving with any
  alcohol consumption, including levels below the 0.08% legal limit'
- 'Step 3: Even sub-legal BAC levels impair driving performance and increase crash
  risk'
- 'Step 4: Policies that reduce driving with BAC levels from >0.00% to <0.08% prevent
  crashes and fatalities that would not be captured by legal limit enforcement alone'
