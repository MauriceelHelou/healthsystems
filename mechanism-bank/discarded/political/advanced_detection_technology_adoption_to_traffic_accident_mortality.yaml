mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Implementation of improved drunk driving detection technology (e.g., transfer
  learning with 93% accuracy) increases enforcement capability and reduces false negatives'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced detection accuracy increases perceived certainty of being caught,
  strengthening deterrent effect at population level'
- 'Step 3: Increased deterrence reduces prevalence of drunk driving behavior in the
  population'
- 'Step 4: Reduction in drunk-driving incidents leads to decrease in traffic accidents
  and associated mortality'
