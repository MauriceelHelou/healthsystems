mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry organizations occupy prominent positions in UK alcohol
  policy processes, gaining access to policy decision-making'
- 'Step 2: Conflict of interest exists between industry economic objectives (maximizing
  alcohol sales and profits) and public health objectives (reducing alcohol-related
  harm)'
- 'Step 3: Industry participation in policy processes shapes policy decisions in ways
  that favor economic interests over public health protection'
- 'Step 4: Resulting policies are less stringent and less effective at reducing population-level
  alcohol consumption and related harms'
