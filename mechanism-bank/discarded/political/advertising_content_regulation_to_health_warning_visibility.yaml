direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Content regulations (e.g., France''s Evin law) restrict the attractiveness
  and design elements of alcohol marketing'
- 'Step 2: Reduced marketing design complexity and attractiveness decreases visual
  competition with health warnings'
- 'Step 3: Less competition from marketing elements increases relative visual prominence
  of health warnings'
- 'Step 4: Increased visual prominence improves noticeability and recall of health
  warnings among consumers'
