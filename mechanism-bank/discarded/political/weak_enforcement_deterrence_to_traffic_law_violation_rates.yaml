direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low enforcement density and infrequent sobriety checkpoints create perception
  that violation is unlikely to be detected'
- 'Step 2: Drivers develop learned experience that drunk driving goes unpunished,
  reinforcing violation behavior'
- 'Step 3: Absence of meaningful consequences normalizes traffic law violation within
  peer networks and driving culture'
- 'Step 4: High baseline violation rates persist and may increase as deterrence mechanisms
  fail'
