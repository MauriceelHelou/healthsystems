direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of mandatory reporting policies means biological samples and toxicology
  results are not systematically collected from crash-involved drivers'
- 'Step 2: Without toxicology data in surveillance systems, epidemiologists cannot
  determine frequency of marijuana-involved crashes'
- 'Step 3: Inability to quantify crash frequency prevents identification of populations
  at elevated risk'
- 'Step 4: Without risk factor identification, targeted prevention and enforcement
  interventions cannot be developed or implemented'
