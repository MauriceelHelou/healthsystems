mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: State-level regulations establish legal requirements for vehicle operation
  and safety feature implementation'
- 'Step 2: Regulatory frameworks mandate or incentivize adoption of alcohol-prevention
  technologies and safety standards'
- 'Step 3: Enforcement mechanisms create structural compliance pressure on vehicle
  operators and manufacturers'
- 'Step 4: Population-level exposure to alcohol-impaired driving decreases through
  regulatory constraint'
- 'Step 5: Reduction in alcohol-related crash frequency results from policy-driven
  safety system implementation'
