mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower legal BAC limit aims to reduce overall prevalence and severity of
  alcohol-impaired driving'
- 'Step 2: Reduced number of impaired drivers on roads should decrease crash frequency
  and severity'
- 'Step 3: Among crashes that do occur, lower average BAC levels may be associated
  with less severe injuries'
- 'Step 4: However, study found no significant decrease in injury severity among alcohol-related
  crashes post-implementation'
