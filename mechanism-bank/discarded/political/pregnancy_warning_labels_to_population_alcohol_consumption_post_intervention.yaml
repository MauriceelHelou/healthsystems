mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnancy warning labels are reintroduced after the intervention period
  following exposure to enhanced warning labels'
- 'Step 2: Prior exposure to cancer warnings and low-risk drinking guidelines may
  have primed population awareness of alcohol harms'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative effect of multiple warning message types increases salience
  of all alcohol-related health risks'
- 'Step 4: Sustained or enhanced reduction in alcohol consumption occurs during post-intervention
  period'
