- 'Step 1: Government delays comprehensive review of alcohol policies, maintaining
  status quo that benefits industry interests'
- 'Step 2: Existing alcohol legislation remains insufficient to address contemporary
  patterns of alcohol availability, marketing, and consumption'
- 'Step 3: Policy stagnation prevents implementation of evidence-based interventions
  that could reduce alcohol-related harm'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol harms persist and inequities widen, particularly affecting communities
  already experiencing structural disadvantages from colonization and socioeconomic
  marginalization'
