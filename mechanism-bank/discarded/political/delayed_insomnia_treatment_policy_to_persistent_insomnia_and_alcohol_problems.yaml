direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Conventional addiction treatment protocols mandate establishing abstinence
  before treating comorbid conditions like insomnia'
- 'Step 2: Untreated insomnia perpetuates sleep disturbance and associated cognitive/emotional
  impairment'
- 'Step 3: Ongoing sleep problems may trigger alcohol use as self-medication and impair
  recovery capacity'
- 'Step 4: Delayed access to evidence-based insomnia treatment (CBT-I) prolongs both
  conditions'
- 'Step 5: Treatment sequencing policy creates barrier to addressing mechanistic pathway
  between sleep and alcohol outcomes'
