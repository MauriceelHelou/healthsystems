mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Rotating sobriety checkpoints across multiple locations creates uncertainty
  for drivers about enforcement location'
- 'Step 2: Drivers require time to learn enforcement patterns and adjust their behavior
  strategically'
- 'Step 3: Before drivers can fully learn and avoid enforcement, the checkpoint location
  changes, maintaining deterrent effect across wider geographic area'
- 'Step 4: Sustained deterrent effect reduces drunk driving behavior across multiple
  routes'
- 'Step 5: Reduced drunk driving leads to fewer nighttime traffic accidents'
