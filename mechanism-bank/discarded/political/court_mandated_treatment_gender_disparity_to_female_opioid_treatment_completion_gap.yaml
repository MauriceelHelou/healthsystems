  node_name: Female Treatment Completion Disparity in Opioid Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Court-mandated treatment systems operate within broader structural context
  that does not address gender-specific barriers to treatment completion'
- 'Step 2: Female patients face additional structural obstacles including childcare
  responsibilities, economic vulnerability, and trauma histories that court mandate
  alone cannot overcome'
- 'Step 3: Treatment programs within mandated settings may lack gender-responsive
  services, reproductive health support, or trauma-informed approaches'
- 'Step 4: Males show improved and variable completion rates (59%, 65%, 64%) under
  mandate while females remain static at 59%, widening gender disparity in treatment
  outcomes'

- name: gender_responsive_services
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Absence of gender-responsive treatment services likely moderates the
    persistent gap in female completion rates, as mandated treatment systems may not
    incorporate childcare support, trauma-informed care, or reproductive health services
    that address structural barriers specific to women.
- name: caregiving_responsibilities
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Structural caregiving burdens disproportionately affecting women may
    weaken the effectiveness of court mandate alone, as legal accountability does
    not remove material barriers to sustained treatment engagement.
