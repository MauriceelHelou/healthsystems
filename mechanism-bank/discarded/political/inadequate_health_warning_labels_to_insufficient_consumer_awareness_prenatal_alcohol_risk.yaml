direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Small warning label size (45 mm² average) reduces visibility and attention
  at point-of-purchase and consumption'
- 'Step 2: Lack of standardized, evidence-based design elements (size, color, positioning,
  imagery) reduces cognitive processing and retention of health risk information'
- 'Step 3: Inconsistent presence of warnings (only 80% of containers) means consumers
  cannot reliably access pregnancy-related risk information across all alcohol purchases'
- 'Step 4: Competing industry messages about ''responsible drinking'' (73% prevalence)
  may contradict or undermine absolute abstinence messages for pregnancy, creating
  confusion about appropriate behavior'
