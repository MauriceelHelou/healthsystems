  node_id: polysubstance_use
  node_name: Polysubstance Use Pattern
direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: DUI conviction triggers technology-based intervention (IID) without mandated
  comprehensive substance use treatment'
- 'Step 2: Absence of treatment component means underlying substance use disorders
  and behavioral patterns remain unaddressed'
- 'Step 3: Drivers adapt to technological constraint through substance substitution
  rather than reducing overall substance use'
- 'Step 4: Upon removal of constraint, drivers combine resumed alcohol use with established
  cannabis use patterns, creating polysubstance use'
