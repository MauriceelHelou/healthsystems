direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism manifests through discriminatory policies, implicit bias
  in clinical decision-making, and unequal resource allocation in healthcare facilities
  serving predominantly minority communities'
- 'Step 2: These structural factors result in differential quality of care, reduced
  screening and monitoring frequency, and lower rates of specialist referral for racial/ethnic
  minorities with ALD'
- 'Step 3: Disparities in care quality and intensity lead to worse disease trajectories
  and higher rates of complications across the ALD continuum'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative disadvantage over the disease course produces worse overall
  outcomes including higher mortality and morbidity for racial/ethnic minorities'
