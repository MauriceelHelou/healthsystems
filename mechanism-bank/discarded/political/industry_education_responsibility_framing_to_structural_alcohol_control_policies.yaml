to_node:
  node_id: structural_alcohol_control_policies
  node_name: Structural Alcohol Control Policies
direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry promotes narrative that education about responsibility
  is the best solution to alcohol problems rather than structural policy controls'
- 'Step 2: This framing shifts discourse from population-level interventions to individual-level
  behavior change approaches'
- 'Step 3: Responsibility narrative undermines political support for evidence-based
  structural policies like pricing, availability restrictions, and marketing controls'
- 'Step 4: Weakened political support prevents implementation or strengthening of
  effective structural alcohol control measures'
