mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stricter pricing policies increase the cost of recorded (legal, taxed)
  alcoholic beverages'
- 'Step 2: Higher prices create economic incentives for consumers to seek cheaper
  alternatives'
- 'Step 3: Consumers shift consumption toward unrecorded alcohol sources (homemade,
  illicit, cross-border) that avoid taxation'
- 'Step 4: Geographic variation in pricing policies creates differential availability
  and use patterns of unrecorded alcohol across countries'
