- 'Step 1: Alcohol industry presents itself as consisting of socially responsible
  companies working toward reducing harmful drinking'
- 'Step 2: This framing positions industry as partner rather than target of regulation,
  suggesting voluntary approaches are adequate'

  than implementing mandatory restrictions'
- 'Step 4: Absence of strong government regulation maintains status quo of extensive
  marketing exposure'
