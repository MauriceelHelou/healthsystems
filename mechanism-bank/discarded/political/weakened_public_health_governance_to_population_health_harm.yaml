direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Industry influence through revolving door practices weakens implementation
  and enforcement of public health regulations on alcohol, unhealthy foods, and gambling'
- 'Step 2: Weaker regulations permit increased marketing, availability, and accessibility
  of health-harming products and activities'
- 'Step 3: Population exposure to alcohol, unhealthy foods, and gambling opportunities
  increases, particularly in vulnerable communities with fewer protective resources'
- 'Step 4: Increased exposure translates to higher rates of alcohol-related diseases,
  diet-related chronic conditions, and gambling-related harms across the population'
