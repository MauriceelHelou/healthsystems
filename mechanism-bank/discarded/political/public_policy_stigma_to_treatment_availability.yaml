direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Policy makers hold stigmatizing views that individuals with substance use
  disorders are to blame for their addiction'
- 'Step 2: These stigmatizing attitudes influence policy decisions regarding resource
  allocation for substance abuse treatment'
- 'Step 3: Punitive rather than treatment-oriented policies are prioritized (e.g.,
  involvement of police mentioned in multiple societal layers)'
- 'Step 4: Limited investment in treatment infrastructure reduces availability and
  accessibility of evidence-based treatment services'
