  are placed on alcoholic beverage packaging as a regulatory intervention'
- 'Step 2: Visual images depicting caloric equivalents activate negative emotional
  responses in consumers as measured by EEG neuropsychological measurements'

  deterrent effect'
- 'Step 4: Consumers exhibit reduced intention to purchase alcoholic beverages with
  pictorial warning labels compared to text-only or no warning conditions'
