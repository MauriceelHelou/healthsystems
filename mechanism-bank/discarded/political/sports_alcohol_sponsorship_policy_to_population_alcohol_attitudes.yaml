direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regulatory frameworks permit alcohol industry sponsorship and advertising
  integration into sports broadcasting and events'
- 'Step 2: This creates systematic, repeated population-level exposure to alcohol
  marketing during culturally valued entertainment activities'
- 'Step 3: Non-conscious automatic processing of alcohol cues normalizes alcohol presence
  in social and recreational contexts'
- 'Step 4: Widespread implicit positive attitudes toward alcohol develop at population
  level, shifting consumption norms and increasing alcohol-related health burden'
