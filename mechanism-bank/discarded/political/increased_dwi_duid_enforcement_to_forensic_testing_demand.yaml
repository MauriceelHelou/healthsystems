mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Law enforcement increases DWI/DUID arrests and blood sample collection'
- 'Step 2: Number of cases submitted to forensic laboratory nearly doubles from 2,000
  to 3,700 cases per year (2014-2018)'
- 'Step 3: Laboratory resources become strained with increased caseload, requiring
  more testing and confirmations'
- 'Step 4: Communication gaps between law enforcement and laboratory management emerge
  regarding capacity'
