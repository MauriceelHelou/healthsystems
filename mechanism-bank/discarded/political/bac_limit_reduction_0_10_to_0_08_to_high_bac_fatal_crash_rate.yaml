direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower BAC limit establishes legal threshold that directly criminalizes
  driving at 0.08+ g/dL'
- 'Step 2: Enhanced enforcement and prosecution targets drivers with BACs at or above
  new limit'
- 'Step 3: Specific deterrent effect emerges for drivers who would have driven with
  BACs between 0.08-0.10 g/dL under old law'
- 'Step 4: Reduced prevalence of high-BAC driving decreases fatal crashes among heavily
  impaired drivers'
