direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stay-at-home orders mandate extended co-residence of household members
  in confined spaces'
- 'Step 2: Policy restricts access to public venues where alcohol would traditionally
  be consumed away from home (bars, restaurants)'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol purchases shift to liquor stores for home consumption rather than
  on-premise consumption at bars'
- 'Step 4: The combination of increased home-based alcohol consumption, extended time
  with intimate partners, pandemic-related stress, and reduced external monitoring
  increases domestic violence risk'
