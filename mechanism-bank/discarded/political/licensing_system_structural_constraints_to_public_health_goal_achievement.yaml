direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current licensing systems contain structural rules that existing businesses
  cannot be closed on availability grounds'
- 'Step 2: This constraint means alcohol availability can only be ''contained'' (preventing
  increases) but not reduced (closing existing outlets)'
- 'Step 3: Public health teams must work within these constraints, limiting their
  ability to reduce outlet density in high-availability areas'
- 'Step 4: Inability to reduce availability in areas with existing high outlet density
  prevents achievement of public health goals for harm reduction'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Areas with existing high outlet density face greater constraints as
    existing businesses cannot be closed, making structural barriers more impactful
    in preventing harm reduction.
- name: public_health_approach_adaptation
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Structural constraints led some public health teams to adopt 'supportive'
    approaches focused on responsible retailing rather than availability reduction,
    further limiting harm reduction potential.
