mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mandatory pregnancy warning elements included as part of voluntary labelling
  pledge for alcohol industry'
- 'Step 2: Only 77.6% of top-selling products display all three required elements
  (unit information, consumption guidelines, pregnancy warnings)'
- 'Step 3: Missing pregnancy warnings on approximately 22.4% of products creates information
  gaps at point of purchase'
- 'Step 4: Reduced access to pregnancy-specific warnings limits informed decision-making
  opportunities for individuals of reproductive age'
