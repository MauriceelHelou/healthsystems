mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maximum trading hours policy specifically targets late-night availability
  by eliminating sales after 4 a.m. (on-license) and 11 p.m. (off-license)'
- 'Step 2: Temporal restriction of alcohol sales creates a structural barrier to alcohol
  consumption during the highest-risk hours (9 p.m. to 5:59 a.m.)'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol access during nighttime hours decreases the number of intoxicated
  individuals in public and social spaces during these times'
- 'Step 4: Lower concentration of intoxicated individuals reduces opportunities for
  alcohol-related conflicts and violence'
- 'Step 5: Fewer nighttime assaults result in a shift in the temporal distribution
  of assault incidents away from late-night hours'
