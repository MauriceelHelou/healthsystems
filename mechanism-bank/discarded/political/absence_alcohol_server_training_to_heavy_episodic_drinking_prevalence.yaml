  node_id: heavy_episodic_drinking_prevalence

direction: positive
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Absence of mandated server training results in lack of standardized practices
  for identifying and managing intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 2: Without formal training, servers lack consistent knowledge and skills to
  effectively limit alcohol service to intoxicated customers'
- 'Step 3: Inconsistent intervention practices allow patrons to continue drinking
  beyond safe levels'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol consumption during drinking episodes leads to higher
  prevalence of heavy episodic drinking and associated acute harms'
