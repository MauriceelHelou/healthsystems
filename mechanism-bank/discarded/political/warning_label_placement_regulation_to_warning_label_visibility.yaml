mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current policy does not mandate front-of-package placement for pregnancy
  warning labels'
- 'Step 2: Industry places warning labels on least visible surfaces (88% on back,
  minimal on front)'
- 'Step 3: Poor placement reduces consumer exposure to warning during product selection
  and purchase'
- 'Step 4: Reduced visibility limits effectiveness of warning label in communicating
  alcohol-pregnancy risks'

  description: Absence of mandatory front-of-package placement allows industry to
    place warnings on back (88%), side (8%), bottom (3%), top (1%), or front (0.3%),
    minimizing visibility.
