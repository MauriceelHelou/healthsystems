mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Restrictive state alcohol policies (measured by Alcohol Policy Scale) reduce
  overall alcohol availability and accessibility through mechanisms like pricing,
  outlet density restrictions, and marketing limits'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol availability decreases population-level alcohol consumption,
  including consumption patterns that result in lower blood alcohol concentrations'
- 'Step 3: Lower rates of driving with any alcohol impairment (even below legal limits)
  reduce crash risk across the BAC spectrum'
- 'Step 4: Reduced alcohol-impaired driving at sub-legal BAC levels results in fewer
  motor vehicle crash fatalities involving BAC <0.08%'
