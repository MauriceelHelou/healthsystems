direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: HFSC policy mandates drug screening and confirmation for DWI/DUID cases
  when BAC < 0.100 g/dL'
- 'Step 2: This threshold captures drivers impaired by drugs but below legal alcohol
  limit or with combined substance use'
- 'Step 3: Cases requiring drug analysis increased from 23% (2014) to 27% (2018) of
  all submissions'
- 'Step 4: 36% of drug-analyzed cases showed polydrug use, revealing extent of combined
  substance impairment'
