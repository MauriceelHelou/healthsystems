direction: negative
category: political
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Recreational cannabis legalization reduces criminal justice referrals,
  a major pathway to treatment'
- 'Step 2: Alternative referral sources (primary care, self-referral, community) do
  not compensate for lost criminal justice referrals'
- 'Step 3: Total CUD treatment admissions decline despite potential increases in cannabis
  use and CUD risk factors post-legalization'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with CUD needs experience reduced access to treatment services'
