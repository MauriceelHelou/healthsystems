direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Blood testing requirements create logistical barriers including need for
  medical personnel, laboratory facilities, and time delays'
- 'Step 2: Testing cannot be performed roadside, requiring transport of suspects and
  increasing resource demands'
- 'Step 3: Time lag between suspected impairment and blood collection reduces accuracy
  of intoxication assessment'
- 'Step 4: Increased challenges and barriers reduce effectiveness of marijuana-impaired
  driving detection and enforcement'
