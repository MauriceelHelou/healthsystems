direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption introduces acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species
  that damage colorectal epithelial cells'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure may induce epigenetic modifications and DNA damage
  in colorectal tissue'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol metabolism interferes with folate metabolism and DNA methylation
  processes'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated cellular damage and epigenetic alterations increase colorectal
  cancer susceptibility'

  description: Multivariable MR analysis revealed smoking effects on CRC risk are
    independent of alcohol drinking, suggesting both exposures may contribute additively
    or synergistically to cancer risk
