direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Amphetamine use increases agitation, paranoia, and aggressive behavior
  through sympathetic nervous system activation'
- 'Step 2: Stimulant intoxication reduces impulse control and increases likelihood
  of violent confrontations'
- 'Step 3: Drug use contexts may involve environments where weapons are present and
  violence is normalized'
- 'Step 4: Combination of drug-induced aggression and weapon availability leads to
  higher rates of penetrating injuries'
