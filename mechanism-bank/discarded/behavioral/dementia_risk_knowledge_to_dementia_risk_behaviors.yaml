direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased knowledge about modifiable risk factors (cardiometabolic health,
  physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, obesity, smoking, alcohol) creates
  awareness'
- 'Step 2: Knowledge mediates the relationship between educational intervention and
  behavior change'
- 'Step 3: Self-efficacy moderates the translation of knowledge into behavior change'
- 'Step 4: Sustained behavior modifications across multiple risk domains reduce overall
  dementia risk'
