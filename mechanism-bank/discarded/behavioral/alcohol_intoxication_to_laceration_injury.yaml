  node_name: Laceration Injury from Punching
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption impairs executive functioning and judgment, reducing
  ability to assess risk and consequences of aggressive behaviors'
- 'Step 2: Intoxication increases likelihood of engaging in physical violence or self-harming
  behaviors involving punching solid objects'
- 'Step 3: Impaired motor control and coordination during intoxication leads to more
  severe impact forces and injury patterns'
- 'Step 4: Reduced pain perception and protective reflexes under alcohol influence
  results in deeper tissue penetration and laceration of neurovascular structures
  and tendons'
