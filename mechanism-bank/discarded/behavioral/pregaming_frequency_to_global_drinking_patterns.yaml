  node_id: global_drinking_patterns
  node_name: Overall Drinking Behavior
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students who pregame at least once per week establish regular patterns
  of high-intensity drinking episodes'
- 'Step 2: Repeated pregaming behavior normalizes and reinforces heavy drinking as
  a routine social practice'
- 'Step 3: Regular pregaming episodes contribute to and sustain elevated overall alcohol
  consumption patterns beyond pregaming contexts'
