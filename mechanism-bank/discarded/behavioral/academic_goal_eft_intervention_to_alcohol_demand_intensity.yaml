direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Episodic future thinking intervention engages cognitive processes related
  to future reward valuation'
- 'Step 2: Cognitive simulation of positive academic future events increases relative
  value of delayed rewards versus immediate alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Shifted reward valuation reduces motivation to consume alcohol at zero
  cost (demand intensity)'
- 'Step 4: Decreased demand intensity measured immediately post-intervention indicates
  altered alcohol reinforcement value'
