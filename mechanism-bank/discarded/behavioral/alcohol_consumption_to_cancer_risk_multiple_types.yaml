direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol is metabolized to acetaldehyde, a carcinogenic compound that damages
  DNA and proteins'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure increases oxidative stress and impairs DNA repair
  mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol disrupts hormone metabolism, particularly sex steroid hormones
  that influence cancer development'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol consumption increases systemic inflammation and compromises immune
  surveillance of cancer cells'
