direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High variability in sleep patterns creates unpredictable sleep experiences
  and daytime dysfunction'
- 'Step 2: Individuals with irregular sleep may use alcohol as a self-medication strategy
  to manage sleep difficulties and associated anxiety'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol is perceived as a sleep aid despite its disruption of sleep architecture
  and quality'
- 'Step 4: Greater sleep unpredictability increases reliance on alcohol as a coping
  mechanism, measured by AUDIT-C scores'
