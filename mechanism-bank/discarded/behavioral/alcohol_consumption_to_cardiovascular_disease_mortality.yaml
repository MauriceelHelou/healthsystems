  node_id: cardiovascular_disease_mortality
  node_name: Cardiovascular Disease Mortality
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption increases blood pressure through sympathetic activation
  and hormonal mechanisms'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood pressure leads to hypertension (affecting over 1.5 billion
  people globally)'
- 'Step 3: Hypertension increases risk of cardiovascular disease events (coronary
  heart disease, heart failure, stroke)'
- 'Step 4: Cardiovascular disease events result in increased mortality risk'
