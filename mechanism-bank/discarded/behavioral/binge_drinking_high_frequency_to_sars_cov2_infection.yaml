direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Binge drinking typically occurs in social settings with reduced physical
  distancing and increased interpersonal contact'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and adherence to protective behaviors
  (mask wearing, distancing)'
- 'Step 3: Binge drinking suppresses immune function, reducing ability to fight off
  viral infections'
- 'Step 4: Combination of increased exposure in social drinking contexts and immune
  suppression elevates infection susceptibility'
