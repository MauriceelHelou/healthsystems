to_node:
  node_id: healthcare_service_underutilization
  node_name: Healthcare Service Underutilization
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption may reflect broader patterns of health-seeking behavior
  or be associated with competing priorities that interfere with regular healthcare
  attendance'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol use may be linked to social determinants such as occupational patterns,
  stress, or community norms that also affect healthcare engagement'
- 'Step 3: Potential stigma or healthcare provider interactions related to alcohol
  use may create barriers to consistent care-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Reduced frequency of healthcare visits results in inadequate disease monitoring
  and management for CAD patients'
