direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Breast cancer from alcohol consumption represents a future, delayed health
  risk with uncertain individual probability'
- 'Step 2: During crisis periods, cognitive and emotional resources are consumed by
  immediate threats and demands'
- 'Step 3: Future health risks become discounted in favor of managing present psychosocial
  wellbeing'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol''s immediate positive effects on stress and mood become more valued
  than prevention of distant cancer risk'
- 'Step 5: Public health messaging about alcohol-cancer links fails to influence behavior
  when temporal horizons are compressed by structural stressors'
