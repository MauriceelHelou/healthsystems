direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Drivers with mean BAC of 0.151 g/dL and median BAC of 0.167 g/dL are operating
  vehicles'
- 'Step 2: These BAC levels are nearly double the legal limit of 0.08 g/dL in Texas'
- 'Step 3: At these BAC levels, drivers experience severe impairment of coordination,
  judgment, and reaction time'
- 'Step 4: Severely impaired driving substantially increases crash risk and traffic
  fatality rates'
