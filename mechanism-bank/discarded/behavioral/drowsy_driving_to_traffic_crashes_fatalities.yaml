direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Driver fatigue manifests as micro-sleep episodes and reduced alertness
  during driving'
- 'Step 2: Micro-sleep causes momentary lapses where driver loses awareness of road
  conditions'
- 'Step 3: Loss of vehicle control during micro-sleep episodes or delayed reactions
  from fatigue lead to crashes'
- 'Step 4: Drowsiness-related crashes result in injuries and fatalities'
