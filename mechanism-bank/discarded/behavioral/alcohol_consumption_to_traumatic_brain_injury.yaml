direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption impairs cognitive function, motor coordination, and
  judgment'
- 'Step 2: Impaired coordination and judgment increase risk of falls, motor vehicle
  accidents, and interpersonal violence'
- 'Step 3: These injury mechanisms result in head trauma requiring emergency department
  evaluation'
- 'Step 4: Patients present to ED with suspected traumatic brain injury requiring
  computed tomography imaging'
