- 'Step 1: Individuals with higher severity of alcohol use develop stronger desire
  for autonomy in managing their condition'
- 'Step 2: Increased severity may be associated with previous negative experiences
  or expectations of treatment'
- 'Step 3: Stigma intensifies with severity, reinforcing preference to handle problems
  privately'
- 'Step 4: Self-management preference becomes a barrier that reduces professional
  treatment engagement'
