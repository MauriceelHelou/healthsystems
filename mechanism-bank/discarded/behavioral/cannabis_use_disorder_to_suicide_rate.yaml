direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increasing THC concentration in cannabis products over time leads to higher
  potency exposure among individuals with cannabis use disorder'
- 'Step 2: Higher potency cannabis exposure increases risk of developing comorbid
  depressive and anxiety disorders'
- 'Step 3: Comorbid mental health conditions amplify suicide risk in individuals with
  cannabis use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Temporal accumulation of these effects produces increasing suicide rates
  from 2010 to 2021'

    indicating these conditions are critical mediators of the cannabis-suicide relationship

  strength: strong
  description: Comorbid other substance use disorders fully attenuate the time trend
    (adjusted IRR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.87-1.06), suggesting polysubstance use is a key
    pathway through which cannabis use disorder increases suicide risk
