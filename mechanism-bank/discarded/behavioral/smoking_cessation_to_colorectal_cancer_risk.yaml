direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smoking cessation eliminates ongoing exposure to tobacco carcinogens and
  toxic compounds'
- 'Step 2: Cessation allows for partial reversal or stabilization of smoking-induced
  DNA methylation changes'
- 'Step 3: Reduction in pro-carcinogenic epigenetic modifications decreases cellular
  susceptibility to malignant transformation'
- 'Step 4: Protective biological processes are restored, reducing accumulated colorectal
  cancer risk over time'
