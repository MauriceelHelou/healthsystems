  node_id: pancreatic_cancer_risk
  node_name: Pancreatic Cancer Risk
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol consumption causes direct toxic damage to pancreatic acinar
  cells through ethanol metabolites (acetaldehyde)'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure promotes inflammation and oxidative stress in
  pancreatic tissue, leading to chronic pancreatitis'
- 'Step 3: Repeated cycles of pancreatic inflammation and cellular damage create an
  environment conducive to genetic mutations and cellular transformation'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated DNA damage and dysregulation of cell growth pathways increase
  risk of malignant transformation to pancreatic cancer'
