- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke components promote endothelial injury and systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Smoking increases blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and blood viscosity'
- 'Step 3: These hemodynamic and hematologic changes accelerate atherosclerotic plaque
  development in cerebral vessels'
- 'Step 4: Atherosclerotic changes and thrombotic tendency lead to cerebrovascular
  occlusion or hemorrhage'
