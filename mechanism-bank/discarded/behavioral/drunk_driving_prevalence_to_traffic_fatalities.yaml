direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol impairment reduces cognitive function, reaction time, and motor
  coordination necessary for safe vehicle operation'
- 'Step 2: Impaired drivers have decreased ability to perceive hazards, make appropriate
  decisions, and execute corrective maneuvers'
- 'Step 3: Increased crash risk from impaired driving results in more severe collisions
  involving drivers, passengers, and other road users'
- 'Step 4: Higher prevalence of drunk driving in population increases overall traffic
  crash frequency and severity, leading to preventable fatalities'
