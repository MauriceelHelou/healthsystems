  node_id: early_morning_bac_lockouts
  node_name: Early Morning BAC Lockouts
direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of recognition that alcohol-related behaviors are problematic prevents
  self-monitoring of drinking timing and quantity'
- 'Step 2: Without awareness, individuals do not adjust drinking patterns to account
  for alcohol metabolism timeframes'
- 'Step 3: Heavy or late-night drinking continues without consideration of morning
  residual BAC levels'
- 'Step 4: Residual alcohol in system triggers IID lockouts during early morning driving
  attempts'
