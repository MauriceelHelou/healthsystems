- 'Step 1: Students with externalizing symptoms (impulsivity, conduct problems) enter
  college environment with behavioral predispositions'
- 'Step 2: Campus environments with high alcohol availability and permissive norms
  interact with externalizing tendencies'

  behaviors and drinking motivations'
- 'Step 4: Common underlying vulnerability factors drive both constructs through shared
  pathways rather than direct causation'
