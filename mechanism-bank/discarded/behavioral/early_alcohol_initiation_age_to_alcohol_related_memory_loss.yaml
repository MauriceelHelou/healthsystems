direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Early alcohol initiation during critical neurodevelopmental periods (≤15
  years) affects brain maturation and risk perception'
- 'Step 2: Young people who drink early establish patterns of heavier consumption
  and risky drinking contexts'
- 'Step 3: These consumption patterns persist into young adulthood, increasing exposure
  to alcohol-related blackouts and memory loss'
- 'Step 4: As early drinking becomes less normative, those who initiate early are
  increasingly concentrated among higher-risk youth populations'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: The association between early initiation and memory loss strengthened
    over time (OR=0.97 for interaction term, 95% CI=0.94-0.99), indicating that as
    youth drinking declined from 2001-2016, early initiators faced increasingly elevated
    risk
- name: normative_drinking_prevalence
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: In cohorts where early drinking was less common, early initiation became
    a stronger marker of risk, suggesting concentration of problems among a smaller
    high-risk group
