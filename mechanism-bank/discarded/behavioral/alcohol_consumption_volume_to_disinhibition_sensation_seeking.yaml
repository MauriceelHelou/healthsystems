direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Regular alcohol consumption affects neurobiological reward pathways and
  prefrontal cortex functioning'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure reduces impulse control mechanisms and increases
  tolerance for risk'
- 'Step 3: These neurological changes manifest as increased disinhibition behaviors
  and reduced behavioral restraint'
- 'Step 4: The cycle reinforces itself as higher disinhibition further promotes alcohol-seeking
  behaviors'
