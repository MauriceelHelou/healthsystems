direction: negative
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Later age of alcohol initiation occurs during periods of greater neurological
  maturity and impulse control development'
- 'Step 2: Youth who begin drinking later have more developed prefrontal cortex functioning,
  supporting better regulation of consumption behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Later initiation allows more time for development of cognitive skills,
  social awareness, and risk assessment before alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 4: Delayed exposure reduces establishment of early drinking patterns and social
  norms around heavy consumption during critical developmental windows'
