direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mental health symptoms exceeding clinical threshold (GHQ≥2) indicate probable
  psychiatric morbidity requiring professional intervention'
- 'Step 2: In India context, crossing this threshold activates additional barriers
  including increased stigma recognition and fear of professional consequences'
- 'Step 3: Medical students above threshold may fear documentation in health records
  and impact on career advancement'
- 'Step 4: These structural and professional risks create avoidance of formal mental
  health services despite clinical need'
