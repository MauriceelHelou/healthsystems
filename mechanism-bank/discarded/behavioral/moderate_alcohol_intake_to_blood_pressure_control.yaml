mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption is recommended as part of lifestyle modifications
  for hypertension management'
- 'Step 2: Moderation in alcohol intake prevents excessive alcohol-induced blood pressure
  elevation'
- 'Step 3: Controlled alcohol consumption supports overall cardiovascular risk reduction
  strategies'
- 'Step 4: Improved blood pressure control reduces target organ damage and cardiovascular
  disease risk'
