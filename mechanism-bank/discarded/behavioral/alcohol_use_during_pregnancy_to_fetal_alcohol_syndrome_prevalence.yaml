direction: positive
category: behavioral
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Population-level alcohol consumption patterns during pregnancy determine
  aggregate exposure levels'
- 'Step 2: Higher rates of drinking during pregnancy increase the number of fetuses
  exposed to alcohol teratogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Increased fetal exposure translates to higher population prevalence of
  FAS cases'
- 'Step 4: Population prevalence reflects the cumulative burden of prenatal alcohol
  exposure in the community'

  description: Korea shows higher prevalence (18-51 per 10,000) compared to global
    rates (14.6 per 10,000), correlating with higher alcohol use during pregnancy
    (16% vs 9.8%)
