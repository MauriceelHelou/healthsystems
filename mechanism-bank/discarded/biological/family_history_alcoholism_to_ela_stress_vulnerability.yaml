direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic factors associated with family history of alcoholism influence
  stress system development'
- 'Step 2: These genetic factors reduce resilience to environmental stressors during
  critical developmental periods'
- 'Step 3: When exposed to early adversity, FH+ individuals show stress system dysregulation
  while FH- individuals maintain normal function'
- 'Step 4: Differential vulnerability results in blunted stress reactivity only among
  FH+ individuals exposed to adversity'
