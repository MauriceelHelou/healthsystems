to_node:
  node_id: large_fiber_neuropathy
  node_name: Large Fiber Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes axonal degeneration of large myelinated
  nerve fibers through direct neurotoxic effects'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency and other nutritional deficits from alcohol use impair
  nerve metabolism and myelin maintenance'
- 'Step 3: Large fiber damage impairs vibration sense, proprioception, and motor function'
- 'Step 4: Reduced amplitudes of sural sensory nerve action potentials indicate large
  fiber dysfunction'
