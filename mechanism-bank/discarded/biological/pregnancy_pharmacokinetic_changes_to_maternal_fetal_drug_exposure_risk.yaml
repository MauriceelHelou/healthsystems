direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnancy induces unique physiological changes affecting drug pharmacokinetics
  and pharmacodynamics'
- 'Step 2: Altered drug metabolism and distribution changes maternal drug levels and
  responses'
- 'Step 3: Drugs cross the placenta exposing the fetus and transfer into breast milk
  exposing the newborn'
- 'Step 4: Changed pharmacological handling increases unpredictable risks for pregnant
  women, fetuses, and breastfeeding infants'
