direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Methamphetamine use is associated with higher rates of severe penetrating
  trauma requiring immediate intervention'
- 'Step 2: Methamphetamine''s cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction)
  may complicate resuscitation and hemodynamic management'
- 'Step 3: Potential interactions between methamphetamine''s sympathomimetic effects
  and trauma-related shock states may worsen physiologic derangement'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects of severe injury patterns and physiologic complications
  increase risk of death before definitive treatment can be achieved'
