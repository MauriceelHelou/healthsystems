direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Trauma exposure activates stress response systems and threat-related neural
  circuits'
- 'Step 2: Genetic variants in neurotransmitter receptors (GRIA1, GRM8) and ion channels
  (CACNA1E) modulate synaptic responses to stress'
- 'Step 3: Alterations in synaptic structure and function genes (PCLO, NCAM1, PDE4B)
  affect neural plasticity and fear processing'
- 'Step 4: Dysregulation of endocrine and immune regulators (ESR1, TRAF3, TANK) perpetuates
  stress response'
- 'Step 5: Combined genetic susceptibility across 95 identified loci increases vulnerability
  to PTSD development'
