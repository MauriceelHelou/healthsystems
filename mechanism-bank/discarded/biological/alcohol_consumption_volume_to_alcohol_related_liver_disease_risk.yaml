direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increasing alcohol consumption creates dose-dependent hepatotoxic exposure
  through acetaldehyde accumulation and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure triggers hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) as the
  initial pathological response to sustained metabolic stress'
- 'Step 3: Continued alcohol consumption promotes inflammatory cascades leading to
  hepatic fibrosis and progressive scarring of liver tissue'
- 'Step 4: Exponential relationship between consumption and risk means that higher
  consumption levels dramatically accelerate progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
  carcinoma'
