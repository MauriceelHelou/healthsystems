direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal consumption of Western-style diet high in fat and simple sugars
  during critical developmental periods (first 1000 days)'
- 'Step 2: Developmental programming effects on fetal immune system through changes
  in gut microbiota, metabolites, and epigenetic modifications'
- 'Step 3: Skewing of neonatal immune cell development in precursor stem cells in
  bone marrow and fetal liver'
- 'Step 4: Dysregulation of innate immunity establishing abnormal innate immune tolerance
  or trained immunity patterns'
- 'Step 5: Reduced immune responses to stimuli in offspring, resulting in increased
  susceptibility to infections'
