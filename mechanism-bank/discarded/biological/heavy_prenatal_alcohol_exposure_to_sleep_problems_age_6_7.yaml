mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy alcohol exposure during pregnancy causes structural and functional
  brain abnormalities in regions controlling sleep'
- 'Step 2: These neurodevelopmental deficits persist as children enter middle childhood'
- 'Step 3: At ages 6-7, children with heavy PAE continue to exhibit elevated sleep
  problems as neurological effects persist through developmental stages'
