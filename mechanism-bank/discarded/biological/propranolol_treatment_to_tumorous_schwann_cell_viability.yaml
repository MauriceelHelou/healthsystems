direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Propranolol is administered at concentrations up to 150 μM for 7 days'
- 'Step 2: Propranolol specifically targets tumorous Schwann cells derived from plexiform
  neurofibromas'
- 'Step 3: The drug suppresses cellular viability in a dose-dependent manner'
- 'Step 4: Cell death or growth inhibition occurs in tumorous Schwann cells while
  sparing non-tumorous fibroblasts from the same tissue'
