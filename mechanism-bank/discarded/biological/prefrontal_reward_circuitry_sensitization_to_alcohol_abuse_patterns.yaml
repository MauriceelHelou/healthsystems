direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Repeated exposure to alcohol marketing during adolescence sensitizes prefrontal-reward
  circuitry to alcohol-related cues'
- 'Step 2: This neural sensitization creates persistent reward associations with alcohol
  consumption'
- 'Step 3: Sensitized reward circuitry increases responsiveness to alcohol cues in
  the environment, promoting consumption behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological changes established during adolescence contribute to the
  development of later patterns of alcohol abuse'
