direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Metabolic syndrome components (visceral adiposity, insulin resistance,
  dyslipidemia) trigger adipokine dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Adipose tissue produces pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduces anti-inflammatory
  factors'
- 'Step 3: Chronic metabolic dysregulation leads to persistent low-grade systemic
  inflammation evidenced by altered inflammatory markers'
