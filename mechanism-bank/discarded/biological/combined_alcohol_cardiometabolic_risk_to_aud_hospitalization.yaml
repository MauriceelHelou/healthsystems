direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patients with both increased alcohol intake and metabolic dysfunction (MetALD)
  experience dual pathogenic processes affecting liver and systemic health'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic dysfunction may exacerbate alcohol-related liver injury and systemic
  complications'
- 'Step 3: Continued hazardous alcohol use despite metabolic comorbidities leads to
  acute decompensation requiring hospitalization'
