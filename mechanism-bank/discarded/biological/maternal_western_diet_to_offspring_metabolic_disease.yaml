direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal Western-style diet consumption during pregnancy affects fetal
  immune system development'
- 'Step 2: Dysregulation of innate immunity in early life through altered gut microbiota,
  metabolites, and epigenetic modifications'
- 'Step 3: Abnormal innate immune tolerance or trained immunity patterns established
  in offspring'
- 'Step 4: Long-term consequences of early-life immune dysregulation manifest as metabolic
  diseases in later life'
