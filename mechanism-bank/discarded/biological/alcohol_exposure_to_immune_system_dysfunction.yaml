  node_id: immune_system_dysfunction
  node_name: Immune System Dysfunction
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol and its metabolites have direct toxic effects on immune cells'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol indirectly modifies mechanisms of intercellular interaction between
  immune cells'
- 'Step 3: These combined effects impair immune system function, reducing the body''s
  ability to respond to infections'
