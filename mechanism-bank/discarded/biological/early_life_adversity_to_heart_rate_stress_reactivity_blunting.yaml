direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Exposure to adverse events during early development affects autonomic nervous
  system calibration'
- 'Step 2: Progressive blunting of cardiovascular stress response occurs with increasing
  levels of adversity'
- 'Step 3: Reduced heart rate reactivity to acute stressors emerges as physiological
  adaptation'
- 'Step 4: This autonomic blunting is specific to individuals with family history
  of alcoholism, indicating gene-environment interaction'
