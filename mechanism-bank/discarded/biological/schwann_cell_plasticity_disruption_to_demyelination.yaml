  node_id: demyelination
  node_name: Demyelination
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Schwann cells are responsible for producing and maintaining myelin sheaths
  around peripheral nerve axons'
- 'Step 2: Diabetes-induced disruption of Schwann cell plasticity impairs their myelination
  function'
- 'Step 3: Loss of normal Schwann cell phenotype leads to breakdown and loss of myelin
  sheaths'
- 'Step 4: Demyelination results in impaired nerve conduction and neurological dysfunction'
