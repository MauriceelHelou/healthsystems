- 'Step 1: Catechin hydrate inhibits inflammatory signaling pathways in pancreatic
  tissue'
- 'Step 2: Reduced inflammatory cascade activation decreases immune cell infiltration
  into pancreas'
- 'Step 3: Decreased immune cell presence reduces local inflammatory mediator release'
- 'Step 4: Overall reduction in pancreatic inflammation and glandular destruction'
