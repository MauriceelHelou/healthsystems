  node_id: immune_dysfunction
  node_name: Immune System Dysfunction
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure (30-60 days) disrupts normal immune system function'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced immune dysregulation alters inflammatory response capacity'
- 'Step 3: Impaired immune function reduces ability to appropriately respond to acute
  pancreatic inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Dysregulated immune response contributes to severity of acute destructive
  pancreatitis complications'
