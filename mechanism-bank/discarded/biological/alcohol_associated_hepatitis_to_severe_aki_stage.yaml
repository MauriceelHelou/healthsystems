to_node:
  node_id: severe_aki_stage
  node_name: Severe AKI Stage
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol-associated hepatitis causes more severe hepatic decompensation
  compared to other etiologies'
- 'Step 2: Greater hepatic dysfunction leads to more pronounced hemodynamic alterations
  and vasoactive mediator release'
- 'Step 3: These systemic changes cause more severe renal hypoperfusion and injury'
- 'Step 4: Patients progress to higher peak AKI stages and require more renal replacement
  therapy'
