direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke introduces toxic compounds including nicotine and carcinogens
  into systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: These toxins promote oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in pancreatic
  tissue'
- 'Step 3: Tobacco constituents may potentiate the effects of other risk factors like
  alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Acute pancreatitis develops with higher rates in males who have greater
  tobacco exposure'
