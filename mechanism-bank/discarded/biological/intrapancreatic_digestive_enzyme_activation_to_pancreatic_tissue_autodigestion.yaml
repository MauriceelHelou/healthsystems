to_node:
  node_id: pancreatic_tissue_autodigestion
  node_name: Pancreatic Tissue Autodigestion
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pancreatic digestive enzymes become activated within the pancreas'
- 'Step 2: Active enzymes, particularly trypsin, are released inappropriately'
- 'Step 3: Autodigestion of pancreatic tissues occurs through enzymatic breakdown'
- 'Step 4: Tissue damage initiates and sustains inflammatory responses'
