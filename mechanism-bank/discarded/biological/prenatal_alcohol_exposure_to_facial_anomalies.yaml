- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during first trimester disrupts neural crest cell migration
  and craniofacial development'
- 'Step 2: Teratogenic effects alter formation of midface structures during critical
  embryonic periods'
- 'Step 3: Characteristic dysmorphology manifests as short palpebral fissures, thin
  vermilion border of upper lip, and smooth philtrum'
