direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Having two biological parents with alcohol use disorder creates genetic
  and/or prenatal environmental vulnerability in offspring'
- 'Step 2: This familial exposure alters neurodevelopmental trajectories in reward-processing
  brain regions during childhood'
- 'Step 3: Specifically, the nucleus accumbens shows blunted activation during anticipation
  of monetary rewards'
- 'Step 4: This reduced reward sensitivity represents a neurobiological vulnerability
  marker measurable before onset of alcohol use'
