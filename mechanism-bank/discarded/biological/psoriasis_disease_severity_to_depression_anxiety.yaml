direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased psoriasis severity (PASI ≥3) creates visible skin lesions and
  physical discomfort that impact daily functioning'
- 'Step 2: Physical symptoms lead to reduced dermatology-specific quality of life
  (DLQI) and overall psychological quality of life impairment'
- 'Step 3: Chronic disease burden and quality of life impairment trigger or exacerbate
  depressive and anxiety symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Approximately 50% of psoriatic patients develop mental health problems,
  primarily depression and anxiety'
