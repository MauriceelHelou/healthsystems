direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive control and emotional regulation capacity'
- 'Step 2: Reduced sleep increases impulsivity and diminishes capacity for adaptive
  coping strategies'
- 'Step 3: Sleep loss exacerbates mental health problems that are risk factors for
  self-injury'
- 'Step 4: Impaired judgment combined with emotional dysregulation increases engagement
  in at-risk behaviors including self-injury'
