direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic constriction injury to the sciatic nerve generates oxidative stress
  with increased lipid peroxidation'
- 'Step 2: Oxidative damage and depleted antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx) impair nerve
  tissue function and structure'
- 'Step 3: Damaged nerve fibers produce aberrant signaling and sensitization of pain
  pathways'
- 'Step 4: Neural sensitization manifests as thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia,
  and dysesthesia'
