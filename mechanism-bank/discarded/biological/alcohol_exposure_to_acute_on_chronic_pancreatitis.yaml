mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure causes progressive pancreatic damage and fibrosis
  leading to chronic pancreatitis'
- 'Step 2: Continued alcohol consumption in the context of pre-existing chronic pancreatitis
  triggers inflammatory cascades'
- 'Step 3: Acute inflammatory episodes superimposed on chronic pancreatic damage result
  in acute-on-chronic pancreatitis exacerbations'
- 'Step 4: These acute exacerbations can lead to necrotizing pancreatitis and potential
  organ failure'
