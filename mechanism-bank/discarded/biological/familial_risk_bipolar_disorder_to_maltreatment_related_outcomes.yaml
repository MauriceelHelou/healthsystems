direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic risk for bipolar disorder creates baseline neurobiological vulnerability
  in brain development'
- 'Step 2: When exposed to childhood maltreatment, genetic vulnerability interacts
  with environmental stress'
- 'Step 3: Gene-environment interaction produces differential susceptibility to maltreatment
  effects on brain structure and function'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with familial risk exhibit different patterns of outcomes following
  childhood maltreatment compared to those without genetic risk'
