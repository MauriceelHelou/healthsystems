  node_name: Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy in Women
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cumulative lifetime alcohol exposure causes direct myocardial toxicity
  in a dose-dependent manner'
- 'Step 2: Women may have increased biological vulnerability to alcohol''s cardiotoxic
  effects due to differences in alcohol metabolism and body composition'
- 'Step 3: Lower lifetime alcohol threshold needed in women to produce myocardial
  damage and impaired cardiac function'
- 'Step 4: Progressive cardiac dysfunction leads to alcoholic cardiomyopathy at lower
  cumulative exposure levels in women compared to men'
