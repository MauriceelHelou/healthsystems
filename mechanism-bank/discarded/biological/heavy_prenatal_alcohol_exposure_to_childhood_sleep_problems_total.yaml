direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Heavy maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy crosses the placental
  barrier and exposes the developing fetus to ethanol'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts neurological development, particularly affecting brain
  regions involved in circadian rhythm regulation and sleep-wake cycles'
- 'Step 3: Impaired neurodevelopment results in dysregulated sleep architecture and
  increased sleep disturbances'
- 'Step 4: Sleep problems persist across childhood (ages 2-9) due to structural brain
  changes from prenatal exposure'
