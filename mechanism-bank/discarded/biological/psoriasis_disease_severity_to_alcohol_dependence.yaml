direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased psoriasis severity (PASI ≥3) causes significant psychological
  distress and reduced quality of life'
- 'Step 2: Psychological distress and impaired mental health (depression, anxiety)
  create vulnerability for substance use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol use may initially serve as self-medication for psychological symptoms
  and social stigma associated with visible skin disease'
- 'Step 4: Chronic alcohol use patterns develop into alcohol dependence, particularly
  in context of ongoing disease burden'
