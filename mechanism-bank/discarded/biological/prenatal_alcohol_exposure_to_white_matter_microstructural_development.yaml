direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts normal white matter tract formation
  during critical periods of fetal and early childhood brain development'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol affects myelination and axonal organization in specific white matter
  tracts, particularly the superior cerebellar peduncle and superior longitudinal
  fasciculus'
- 'Step 3: Children with PAE demonstrate altered developmental trajectories with more
  rapid FA changes from neonatal to 2-3 years, followed by more tapered development
  from 2-3 to 6-7 years'
- 'Step 4: Altered white matter maturation patterns persist across early childhood,
  differing from unexposed control children throughout the 6-7 year observation period'
