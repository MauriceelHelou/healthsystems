  node_name: Incident Diabetes
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression symptoms in midlife activate chronic stress response systems
  including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged HPA axis activation leads to elevated cortisol levels and insulin
  resistance over decades'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation (measured by C-reactive protein) and metabolic dysregulation
  accumulate over the 27-year follow-up period'
- 'Step 4: These biological cascades culminate in clinical diabetes diagnosis in late
  adulthood'

moderators:
- name: somatic_depression_symptoms
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: When somatic depression symptoms were excluded, the association became
    non-significant, suggesting somatic symptoms drive the relationship
- name: body_mass_index
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: BMI was controlled for and association remained significant, suggesting
    independent pathway beyond weight-related mechanisms
- name: polygenic_risk_diabetes
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Polygenic risk for diabetes was controlled for, suggesting depression
    effect operates independently of genetic predisposition
