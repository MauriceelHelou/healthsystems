direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pancreatic duct duplication creates abnormal pancreatic drainage anatomy'
- 'Step 2: Altered ductal anatomy leads to impaired pancreatic secretion drainage
  and increased ductal pressure'
- 'Step 3: Chronic ductal obstruction and elevated pressure cause recurrent inflammation
  of pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 4: Repeated inflammatory episodes result in progressive pancreatic damage
  and chronic pancreatitis'
