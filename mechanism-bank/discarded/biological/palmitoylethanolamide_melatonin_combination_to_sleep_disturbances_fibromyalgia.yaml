direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Melatonin directly regulates circadian rhythm and promotes sleep initiation
  and maintenance'
- 'Step 2: Palmitoylethanolamide reduces pain intensity, removing a barrier to sleep
  quality'
- 'Step 3: Combined therapy addresses both sleep regulation and pain-related sleep
  disruption'
- 'Step 4: Insomnia severity decreases as measured by ISI scores at 1 and 3 months'
