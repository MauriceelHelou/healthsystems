to_node:
  node_id: exocrine_pancreatic_dysfunction
  node_name: Exocrine Pancreatic Dysfunction
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pancreatic atrophy represents loss of functional pancreatic tissue mass'
- 'Step 2: Reduced pancreatic tissue results in decreased production and secretion
  of pancreatic enzymes (lipase, amylase, proteases)'
- 'Step 3: Insufficient enzyme production leads to exocrine pancreatic dysfunction,
  manifested as fecal elastase levels below 200 μg/g'
