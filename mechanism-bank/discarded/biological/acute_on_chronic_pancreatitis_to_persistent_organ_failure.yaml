mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acute inflammatory exacerbation superimposed on chronic pancreatic dysfunction
  triggers systemic inflammatory response syndrome'
- 'Step 2: Severe inflammation leads to necrotizing pancreatitis in 49% of cases,
  releasing inflammatory mediators systemically'
- 'Step 3: Systemic inflammation causes multi-organ dysfunction affecting respiratory,
  renal, and cardiovascular systems'
- 'Step 4: In 9% of cases, organ dysfunction becomes persistent rather than transient,
  requiring intensive care support'
