- 'Step 1: Severe and frequent chest trauma events result in emergency department
  admission'
- 'Step 2: Traumatic forces to thorax cause multiple rib fractures (study population
  median thoracic trauma severity score of 8)'
- 'Step 3: Multiple rib fractures create acute injury requiring pain management and
  respiratory support'
- 'Step 4: Patients admitted to Sub-intensive Care Unit for monitoring and treatment
  of multiple rib fractures'
