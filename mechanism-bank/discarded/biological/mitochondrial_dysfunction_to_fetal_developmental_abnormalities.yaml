direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mitochondrial dysfunction reduces cellular energy (ATP) production in rapidly
  developing fetal brain tissue'
- 'Step 2: Energy deficits impair critical neurodevelopmental processes including
  neuronal migration, differentiation, and synaptogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Mitochondrial damage triggers apoptotic pathways leading to increased cell
  death in developing brain regions'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated cellular damage during critical developmental windows manifests
  as structural and functional abnormalities characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome'
