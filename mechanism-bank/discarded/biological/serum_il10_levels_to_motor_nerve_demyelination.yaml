direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated serum IL-10 indicates immune system activation in response to
  diabetic neuropathy'
- 'Step 2: IL-10 elevation correlates with inflammatory processes affecting Schwann
  cells that produce myelin'
- 'Step 3: Myelin sheath integrity is compromised through inflammatory and metabolic
  stress in diabetes'
- 'Step 4: Demyelination of motor nerves occurs, manifested as prolonged distal latencies
  and reduced conduction velocities'
