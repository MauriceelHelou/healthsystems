  node_name: Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (Chronic Neurocognitive Deficits)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol misuse leads to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency through
  impaired absorption and utilization'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency causes acute Wernicke''s Encephalopathy, damaging brain
  structures involved in memory and cognition'
- 'Step 3: In approximately 85% of survivors, acute WE progresses to chronic Wernicke-Korsakoff
  syndrome with persistent neurocognitive deficits'
- 'Step 4: Without adequate intervention, these cognitive deficits remain severe and
  functionally impairing'
