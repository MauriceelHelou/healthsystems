to_node:
  node_id: atrial_fibrillation_episode
  node_name: Atrial Fibrillation Episode
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher peak blood alcohol concentrations reflect greater acute alcohol
  exposure to cardiac tissue'
- 'Step 2: Peak alcohol levels correlate with maximum electrophysiological disturbance
  in atrial myocardium'
- 'Step 3: Increased peak concentrations produce more severe acute autonomic imbalance'
- 'Step 4: Greater physiological perturbation increases probability of crossing arrhythmia
  threshold'
