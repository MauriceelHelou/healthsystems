to_node:
  node_id: colon_cancer_incidence
  node_name: Colon Cancer Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predisposition to higher lifetime smoking increases exposure to
  tobacco carcinogens over extended period'
- 'Step 2: Carcinogens reach colon tissue through systemic circulation'
- 'Step 3: Mutagenic compounds induce DNA damage in colon epithelial cells'
- 'Step 4: Clonal expansion of mutated cells leads to adenoma formation and progression
  to carcinoma'
