direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Reduced insula gray matter volume impairs neural circuits involved in craving,
  interoception, and self-regulation'
- 'Step 2: In individuals with familial risk for bipolar disorder, genetic vulnerability
  compounds neurobiological effects of reduced insula GMV'
- 'Step 3: Combined genetic risk and structural brain changes create heightened vulnerability
  to alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Individuals with both lower insula GMV and familial bipolar disorder risk
  exhibit greater quantity of alcohol consumption'
