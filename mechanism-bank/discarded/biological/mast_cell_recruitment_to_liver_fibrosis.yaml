direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Activated mast cells release profibrotic mediators including TGF-β1'
- 'Step 2: TGF-β1 activates the Smad2/3 signaling pathway in hepatic stellate cells'
- 'Step 3: Smad2/3 activation promotes collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix
  deposition'
- 'Step 4: Mast cells also activate HIF-1α/VEGF pathway promoting angiogenesis and
  fibrosis progression'
- 'Step 5: Accumulated collagen deposition results in hepatic fibrosis'
