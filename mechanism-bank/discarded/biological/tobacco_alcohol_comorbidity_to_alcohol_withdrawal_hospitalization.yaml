direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural factors including targeted marketing and neighborhood outlet
  density increase both alcohol and tobacco use in Black communities'
- 'Step 2: Co-occurring alcohol and tobacco use indicates higher levels of alcohol
  dependence requiring regular consumption to prevent withdrawal'
- 'Step 3: Hospitalization for acute pancreatitis interrupts regular alcohol access
  for patients with dependence'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of alcohol withdrawal symptoms manifest during hospitalization
  in Black patients (p<0.001) due to greater alcohol dependence stemming from structural
  exposure patterns'
