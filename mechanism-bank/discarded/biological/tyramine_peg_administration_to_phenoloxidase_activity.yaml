direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tyramine-PEG complex activates immune signaling pathways in shrimp hemocytes'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged immune signaling upregulates expression of prophenoloxidase system-related
  genes'
- 'Step 3: Increased gene expression leads to enhanced production of prophenoloxidase
  enzymes'
- 'Step 4: Elevated prophenoloxidase levels result in sustained increased phenoloxidase
  activity for pathogen recognition and melanization'
