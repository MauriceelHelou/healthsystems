direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated inflammatory factors in the context of gastrointestinal dysfunction
  create systemic inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Systemic inflammation disrupts normal neurotransmitter metabolism and sleep-wake
  regulation pathways'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory processes affect mood regulation centers, contributing to
  depression and anxiety symptoms measured by HAMD and DASS-21'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects result in worse insomnia severity, increased depression
  scores, and elevated anxiety symptoms'
