direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance-impaired assailants use punching as primary mechanism of assault
  (67.9% of cases)'
- 'Step 2: Blunt force trauma from fist impact causes subcutaneous hemorrhage and
  tissue damage'
- 'Step 3: Soft tissue injury manifests as contusion, laceration, or hematoma without
  necessarily causing bone fracture'
- 'Step 4: Statistical analysis confirms punches result in significantly higher soft
  tissue contusion (p = .046)'

  description: Facial region has high soft tissue density and vascular supply, making
    it particularly vulnerable to contusion from blunt force trauma
