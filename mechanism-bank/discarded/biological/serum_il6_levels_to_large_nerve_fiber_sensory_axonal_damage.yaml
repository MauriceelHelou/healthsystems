direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Elevated serum IL-6 levels indicate systemic inflammatory state in type
  2 diabetes mellitus patients'
- 'Step 2: IL-6 crosses into peripheral nerve tissue and promotes inflammatory cascade
  activation'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory mediators induce oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
  in large sensory nerve fibers'
- 'Step 4: Axonal degeneration occurs in large sensory nerve fibers, detectable by
  electrodiagnostic testing'
