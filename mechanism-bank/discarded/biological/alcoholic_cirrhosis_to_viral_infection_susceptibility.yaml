direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to development of alcoholic cirrhosis with
  liver damage'
- 'Step 2: Cirrhosis is associated with altered natural killer (NK) cell receptor
  expression and function'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted balance between stimulatory (aKIR) and inhibitory (iKIR) NK cell
  receptors and HLA ligands impairs innate immune response'
- 'Step 4: Compromised innate immunity increases susceptibility to viral infections
  including HCV, HBV, and CMV'
