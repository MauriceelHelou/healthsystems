direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Nerve damage evolves into a debilitating neuropathic state affecting sensory
  and motor pathways'
- 'Step 2: Damaged nerves produce aberrant signaling leading to pain hypersensitivity
  (hyperalgesia and allodynia)'
- 'Step 3: Progressive nerve damage manifests as multiple symptoms including dysesthesia,
  ataxia, numbness, and immobility'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated nerve dysfunction causes decline in body functions and loss
  of motor control'
