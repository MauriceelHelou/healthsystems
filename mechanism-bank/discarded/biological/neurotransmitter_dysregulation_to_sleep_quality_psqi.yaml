to_node:
  node_id: sleep_quality_psqi
  node_name: Sleep Quality (PSQI Score)
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low serum levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
  (5-HIAA), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) indicate neurotransmitter dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Deficient neurotransmitter levels impair normal sleep-wake cycle regulation
  and melatonin production pathways'
- 'Step 3: Treatment interventions (Tiaoshu Anshen Decoction) that increase these
  neurotransmitter levels improve sleep architecture and reduce sleep latency'
- 'Step 4: Normalized neurotransmitter systems result in decreased PSQI scores, improved
  sleep quality, and reduced insomnia symptoms'
