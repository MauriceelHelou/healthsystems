to_node:
  node_id: colorectal_cancer_incidence
  node_name: Colorectal Cancer Incidence
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic predisposition to higher lifetime smoking increases cumulative
  exposure to tobacco carcinogens'
- 'Step 2: Carcinogens are metabolized and circulate systemically, reaching colorectal
  tissue'
- 'Step 3: Direct and indirect mutagenic effects on colonocytes cause DNA damage'
- 'Step 4: Accumulated mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes lead to malignant
  transformation'
