direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Overweight status increases systemic inflammation and insulin resistance
  in the body'
- 'Step 2: Elevated insulin and insulin-like growth factors promote cell proliferation
  in colorectal tissue'
- 'Step 3: Chronic inflammation creates oxidative stress and damages DNA in colon
  cells'
- 'Step 4: These biological changes increase risk of colorectal tumor development
  and progression'
- 'Step 5: Advanced colorectal cancer leads to increased mortality'
