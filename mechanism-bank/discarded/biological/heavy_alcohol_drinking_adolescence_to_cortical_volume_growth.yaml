  node_id: cortical_volume_growth
  node_name: Cortical Volume Growth
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure during adolescent/young adult neurodevelopment
  when cortical maturation is ongoing'
- 'Step 2: Cortical volume showed age-dependent increases throughout study period
  in both control and alcohol-exposed animals'
- 'Step 3: Despite overall brain and thalamic growth attenuation, cortical volume
  growth rate was not significantly affected by alcohol'
- 'Step 4: This suggests differential regional vulnerability with subcortical structures
  (particularly thalamus) showing greater sensitivity to alcohol-induced developmental
  disruption than cortical regions during this developmental window'

  description: Cortical regions showed relative resilience to alcohol-induced growth
    disruption compared to subcortical structures, with no significant effect on cortical
    growth rate despite significant effects on total brain and thalamic volume
- name: developmental_stage
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: During late adolescence/early adulthood period studied, cortical development
    may be in different maturational stage with less vulnerability to alcohol compared
    to actively developing subcortical structures
