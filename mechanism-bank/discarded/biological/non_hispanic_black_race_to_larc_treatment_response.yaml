direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-Hispanic Black race remains independently associated with less favorable
  treatment response after accounting for demographic, clinical, pathologic, and social
  determinant factors'
- 'Step 2: This independent association suggests unmeasured biological variables (potentially
  genetic tumor characteristics, pharmacogenomic differences in drug metabolism, or
  differences in tumor microenvironment) that affect response to neoadjuvant therapy'
- 'Step 3: Alternatively, unidentified social determinants of health not captured
  in the study (such as chronic stress from structural racism, environmental exposures,
  nutritional factors, or barriers to optimal treatment adherence) may mediate this
  relationship'
- 'Step 4: These unmeasured factors lead to differential tumor response rates and
  overall treatment outcomes for locally advanced rectal cancer'
