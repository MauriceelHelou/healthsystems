category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher amounts of alcohol intake (116.59±45.60 in middle class and 110.0±62.45
  in upper class) create toxic metabolic burden on hepatocytes'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure causes progressive hepatocyte deterioration and
  loss of liver function'
- 'Step 3: Impaired hepatic function leads to accumulation of neurotoxic substances
  that cross the blood-brain barrier'
- 'Step 4: Neurotoxic accumulation manifests as progressive hepatic encephalopathy
  with worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment'

  description: Middle and upper classes showed similar high consumption levels (116.59±45.60
    and 110.0±62.45 respectively), but lower classes had less access to protective
    healthcare interventions
