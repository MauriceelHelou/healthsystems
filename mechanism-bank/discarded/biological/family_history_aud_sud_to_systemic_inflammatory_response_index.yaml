- 'Step 1: Family history of AUD/SUD causes neuroendocrine dysregulation'
- 'Step 2: Neuroendocrine disruption leads to immune system imbalance'
- 'Step 3: Increased neutrophils and monocytes elevate SIRI values'
- 'Step 4: Heightened systemic inflammation contributes to neurocognitive alterations
  and increased AUD/SUD risk'
