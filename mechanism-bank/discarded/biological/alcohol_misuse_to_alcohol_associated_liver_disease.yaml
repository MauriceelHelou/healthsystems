mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol misuse leads to direct hepatotoxic effects and metabolic stress
  on liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: Chronic alcohol exposure progresses through stages from simple steatosis
  (fatty liver) to more severe pathology'
- 'Step 3: Disease spectrum advances through inflammation and fibrosis to cirrhosis
  and its complications'
- 'Step 4: Liver becomes the most common organ affected by alcohol misuse'
