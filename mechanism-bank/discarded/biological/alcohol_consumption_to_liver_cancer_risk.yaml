direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and
  inflammation'
- 'Step 2: Repeated cycles of hepatocyte injury and regeneration lead to fibrosis
  and cirrhosis'
- 'Step 3: Cirrhotic liver tissue creates microenvironment conducive to carcinogenesis
  through chronic inflammation and oxidative stress'
- 'Step 4: Dysplastic nodules develop in cirrhotic liver with progression to hepatocellular
  carcinoma'
