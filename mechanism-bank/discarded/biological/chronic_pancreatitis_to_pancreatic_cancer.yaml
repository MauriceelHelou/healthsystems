mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic inflammation creates sustained oxidative stress and cellular damage
  in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Repeated cycles of damage and repair increase risk of cellular mutations'
- 'Step 3: Accumulation of mutations in chronically inflamed tissue can lead to neoplastic
  transformation and pancreatic cancer'
