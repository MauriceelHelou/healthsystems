  node_id: caffeinated_soda_consumption
  node_name: Daily Caffeinated Soda Consumption
to_node:
  node_id: impulsivity
  node_name: Impulsivity
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Daily caffeinated soda consumption exposes developing brains to chronic
  caffeine stimulation'
- 'Step 2: Caffeine modulates dopaminergic and adenosinergic neurotransmitter systems
  in preadolescent brains'
- 'Step 3: Altered neurotransmitter signaling affects development of prefrontal cortex
  circuits involved in impulse control'
- 'Step 4: Impaired executive function manifests as higher impulsivity scores'
