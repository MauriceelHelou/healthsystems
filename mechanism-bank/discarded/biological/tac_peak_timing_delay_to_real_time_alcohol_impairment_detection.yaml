direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Wrist-worn Skyn sensor shows TAC peaks 54 minutes after peak BrAC, compared
  to 120 minutes for ankle-worn SCRAM'
- 'Step 2: Earlier TAC peak timing provides more temporally accurate representation
  of actual blood alcohol concentration during drinking episodes'
- 'Step 3: Reduced time lag between actual impairment (peak BAC) and detected impairment
  (peak TAC) enables more timely intervention'
- 'Step 4: More accurate temporal detection could support policies requiring real-time
  notification of alcohol consumption violations, potentially preventing impaired
  driving events'
