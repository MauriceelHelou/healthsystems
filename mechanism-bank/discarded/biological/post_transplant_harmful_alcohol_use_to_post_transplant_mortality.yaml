direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Return to harmful alcohol use following liver transplant causes direct
  hepatotoxic injury to transplanted liver graft'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption may reduce medication adherence including immunosuppression
  protocols, increasing rejection risk'
- 'Step 3: Heavy alcohol use contributes to systemic complications including cardiovascular
  disease, malnutrition, and infection susceptibility'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative organ damage from recurrent alcohol exposure increases mortality
  risk in transplant recipients'

  description: The association between harmful alcohol use and mortality was significant
    on univariate analysis (HR 1.69, p=0.03) but not on multivariable regression (HR
    1.54, p=0.10), suggesting confounding by other factors
