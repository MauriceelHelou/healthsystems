direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts neuronal proliferation, migration, and
  differentiation during critical fetal brain development'
- 'Step 2: Structural and functional brain abnormalities result in impaired neural
  substrates for cognitive processing'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological disruptions manifest as measurable deficits in overall
  cognitive ability'
- 'Step 4: Reduced Full Scale IQ scores in adolescence and young adulthood reflect
  cumulative neurodevelopmental impact'
