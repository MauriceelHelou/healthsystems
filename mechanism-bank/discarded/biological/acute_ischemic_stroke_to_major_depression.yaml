direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Ischemic stroke causes focal brain lesions particularly in frontal-subcortical
  circuits involved in mood regulation'
- 'Step 2: Disruption of serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways due to stroke-induced
  neuronal damage'
- 'Step 3: Inflammatory responses and cytokine release post-stroke contribute to depressive
  symptoms'
- 'Step 4: Combined neurobiological changes manifest as major depressive disorder
  in acute post-stroke period'
