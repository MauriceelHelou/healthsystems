mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumed during pregnancy crosses the placental barrier and reaches
  the developing fetus'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol disrupts cellular development and differentiation during critical
  periods of organogenesis'
- 'Step 3: Teratogenic effects of alcohol lead to structural malformations and major
  birth defects'
