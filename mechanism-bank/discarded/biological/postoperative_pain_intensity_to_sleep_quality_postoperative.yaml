  node_id: sleep_quality_postoperative

direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Surgical trauma and tissue injury generate inflammatory mediators and nociceptive
  signaling'
- 'Step 2: Pain signals disrupt sleep architecture through activation of arousal systems
  and prevention of deep sleep stages'
- 'Step 3: Pain-related sleep fragmentation and reduced sleep quality measured by
  PSQI'
- 'Step 4: Bidirectional relationship where poor sleep also reduces pain threshold
  and increases pain perception'
