direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Administration of priming dose of intravenous alcohol triggers neurobiological
  reward pathways'
- 'Step 2: In high-risk social drinkers with genetic/familial vulnerability, alcohol
  exposure induces craving responses'
- 'Step 3: Following priming, high-risk drinkers show craving levels comparable to
  heavy drinkers, eliminating baseline differences'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol-induced craving may drive subsequent binge drinking behavior in
  genetically vulnerable individuals'
