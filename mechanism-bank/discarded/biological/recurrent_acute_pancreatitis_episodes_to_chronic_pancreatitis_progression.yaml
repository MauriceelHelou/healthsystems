mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Each acute pancreatitis episode causes necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells
  and release of inflammatory mediators'
- 'Step 2: Repeated injury prevents complete pancreatic tissue regeneration between
  episodes'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative damage activates pancreatic stellate cells leading to progressive
  fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: Fibrotic replacement of functional pancreatic tissue establishes chronic
  pancreatitis pathology'
