direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure (20% ethanol solution at 2.92 g/kg for 30-60 days)
  leads to progressive impairment of hepatocyte capacity'
- 'Step 2: Prolonged alcohol intoxication causes immune system dysregulation and metabolic
  disturbances'
- 'Step 3: Pre-existing immunometabolic dysfunction from chronic alcohol creates susceptibility
  when acute pancreatitis occurs'
- 'Step 4: Combined pathology results in more severe acute destructive pancreatitis
  with greater metabolic derangements compared to pancreatitis alone'

  description: Longer duration of chronic alcohol intoxication (60 days vs 30 days)
    results in more severe metabolic and immune dysfunction, requiring different therapeutic
    approaches
