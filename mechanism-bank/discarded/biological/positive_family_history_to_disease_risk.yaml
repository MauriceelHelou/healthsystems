direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Positive family history indicates shared genetic susceptibility and environmental
  factors within families'
- 'Step 2: Genetic predisposition creates biological vulnerability to disease development
  through inherited risk alleles'
- 'Step 3: Combined genetic and familial environmental factors increase likelihood
  of disease manifestation'
- 'Step 4: Without pre-symptomatic identification, individuals remain unaware of elevated
  risk and miss opportunities for early intervention'
