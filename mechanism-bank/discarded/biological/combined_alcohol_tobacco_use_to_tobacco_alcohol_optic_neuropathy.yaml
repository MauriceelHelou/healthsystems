direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Combined chronic alcohol misuse and smoking creates synergistic toxic effects
  on nutritional status and optic nerve function'
- 'Step 2: Dual substance use leads to tobacco alcohol optic neuropathy (TAON), causing
  visual impairment'
- 'Step 3: Visual impairment compounds cognitive deficits from WKS, further limiting
  functional capacity'
- 'Step 4: Early vitamin substitution and detoxification can successfully treat TAON,
  distinguishing it from the more persistent cognitive deficits of WKS'
