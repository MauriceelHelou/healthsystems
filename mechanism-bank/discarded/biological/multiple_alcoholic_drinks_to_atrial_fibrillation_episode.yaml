to_node:
  node_id: atrial_fibrillation_episode
  node_name: Atrial Fibrillation Episode
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Consumption of 2 or more drinks produces higher blood alcohol concentrations'
- 'Step 2: Higher alcohol levels cause more pronounced cardiac electrophysiological
  disturbances'
- 'Step 3: Increased atrial ectopy and altered conduction properties reach threshold
  for arrhythmia'
- 'Step 4: Probability of discrete AF episode increases substantially in dose-dependent
  manner'
