direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnancy induces physiological changes in the maternal immune system to
  maintain fetal tolerance'
- 'Step 2: Immune responses at the maternal-fetal interface are altered to prevent
  rejection of semi-allogeneic fetus'
- 'Step 3: These immune system modifications create a state of relative immunosuppression'
- 'Step 4: Altered immune responses affect both innate and adaptive immunity during
  pregnancy-puerperal period'
