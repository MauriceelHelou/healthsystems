- 'Step 1: Substance use disorders are prevalent among Veterans experiencing homelessness
  and housing instability'
- 'Step 2: Chronic substance use causes direct neurotoxic effects on brain tissue
  and cognitive function'
- 'Step 3: Substance use disorders co-occur with other medical and psychiatric conditions,
  creating cumulative health burden'
- 'Step 4: Combined effects of neurotoxicity and multimorbidity accelerate cognitive
  decline and dementia onset'
