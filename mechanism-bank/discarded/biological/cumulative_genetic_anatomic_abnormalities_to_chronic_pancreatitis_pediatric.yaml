direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multiple risk factors (PRSS1 mutation plus pancreatic duct duplication)
  create synergistic biological vulnerability'
- 'Step 2: Genetic predisposition lowers threshold for pancreatic inflammation while
  anatomic abnormality creates mechanical obstruction'
- 'Step 3: Combined effects produce more severe and earlier onset of pancreatic inflammation
  than either factor alone'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative damage leads to accelerated progression to chronic pancreatitis
  requiring complex intervention'
