mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: WKS causes structural damage to mammillary bodies and bilateral thalamic
  lesions'
- 'Step 2: These brain structures are critical for memory consolidation and retrieval'
- 'Step 3: Loss of corpus mammillae disrupts Papez circuit function'
- 'Step 4: Memory dysfunction, learning disturbance, and cognitive impairment result'
