direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: First-degree relatives share approximately 50% of genetic variants, transmitting
  heritable risk for AUD'
- 'Step 2: Family history also captures shared environmental exposures including household
  stress, parental modeling of alcohol use, and social norms'
- 'Step 3: Combined genetic and environmental transmission through family creates
  elevated risk for AUD development'
- 'Step 4: Family history measures capture both inherited polygenic risk and familial
  environmental factors not fully captured by PRS alone'
