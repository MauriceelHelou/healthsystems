  node_id: nicotine_dependence_severity
  node_name: Nicotine Dependence Severity (FTND Score)
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants associated with cigarettes consumed per day aggregate
  into a polygenic risk score reflecting biological factors influencing nicotine metabolism
  and dependence'
- 'Step 2: These variants affect nicotine receptor sensitivity, dopamine signaling,
  and rate of nicotine clearance from the body'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with higher genetic risk have greater neurobiological drive
  to maintain higher nicotine levels through more frequent smoking'
- 'Step 4: This biological drive manifests as higher scores on standardized nicotine
  dependence measures (FTND)'
