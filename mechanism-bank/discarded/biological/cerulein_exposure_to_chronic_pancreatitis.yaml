direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Repeated cerulein injection causes sustained pancreatic overstimulation
  and cellular stress'
- 'Step 2: Chronic stimulation leads to acinar cell loss and tissue damage'
- 'Step 3: Tissue damage triggers inflammatory response with immune cell infiltration'
- 'Step 4: Persistent inflammation activates fibrotic pathways including TGF-β signaling'
- 'Step 5: Development of chronic pancreatitis with fibrosis, glandular destruction,
  and functional impairment'
