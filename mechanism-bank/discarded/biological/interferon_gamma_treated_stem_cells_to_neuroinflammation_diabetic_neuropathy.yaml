direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IFN-γ-treated stem cells reduce mRNA expression of chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2,
  CXCL9, CXCL10) in sciatic nerve fibers and Schwann cells'
- 'Step 2: Reduced chemokine expression decreases inflammatory cell recruitment to
  nerve tissue'
- 'Step 3: Decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in
  serum and Schwann cells'
- 'Step 4: Reduced inflammation diminishes nerve damage and improves neurological
  function'
