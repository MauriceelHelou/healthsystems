direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High-intensity drinking patterns create rapid increases in alcohol concentration,
  exposing the brain to specific pharmacokinetic profiles'
- 'Step 2: The rate of alcohol concentration change affects neuroadaptation processes
  differently than steady-state alcohol exposure'
- 'Step 3: Repeated exposure to rapid concentration changes may accelerate tolerance
  development and neurobiological changes associated with dependence'
- 'Step 4: These neuroadaptations increase vulnerability to developing alcohol use
  disorder through altered reward processing and control systems'
