direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: In utero exposure to maternal HIV creates inflammatory environment affecting
  developing white matter tracts'
- 'Step 2: White matter is particularly sensitive to neuroinflammatory processes during
  early brain development'
- 'Step 3: Glial cell activation in white matter regions produces elevated myo-inositol
  as marker of inflammation'
- 'Step 4: Left parietal white matter shows significantly higher myo-inositol to creatine
  ratios in HIV-exposed children'
