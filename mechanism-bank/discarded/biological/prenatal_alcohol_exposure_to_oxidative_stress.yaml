direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure during critical developmental periods increases reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generation in brain mitochondria'
- 'Step 2: Excessive ROS production overwhelms endogenous antioxidant defense systems
  in developing fetal tissues'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated ROS causes lipid peroxidation of cellular and mitochondrial
  membranes'
- 'Step 4: Oxidative damage impairs cellular function and contributes to developmental
  abnormalities'
