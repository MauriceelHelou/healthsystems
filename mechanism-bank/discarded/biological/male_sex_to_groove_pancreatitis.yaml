direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Male sex is associated with higher rates of excessive alcohol consumption
  and tobacco smoking due to gendered social norms and occupational exposures'
- 'Step 2: Men experience greater cumulative exposure to key risk factors (alcohol,
  tobacco) over time'
- 'Step 3: Biological sex differences in pancreatic metabolism and inflammatory responses
  may increase male vulnerability to toxin-induced pancreatic damage'
- 'Step 4: Combined differential exposure and biological vulnerability result in disproportionate
  development of groove pancreatitis in men'
