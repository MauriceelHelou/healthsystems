direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Thiamine is essential cofactor for enzymes in glucose metabolism and energy
  production in brain cells'
- 'Step 2: Deficiency impairs oxidative metabolism and ATP production in neurons,
  particularly in memory-related brain regions'
- 'Step 3: Neuronal dysfunction and potential structural damage occur in areas critical
  for cognitive function'
- 'Step 4: Cognitive performance, particularly memory tasks, declines as neurological
  damage progresses'
