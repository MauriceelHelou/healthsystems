direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol use disorder leads to thiamine deficiency through multiple pathways
  (impaired absorption, increased utilization, reduced intake)'
- 'Step 2: Thiamine deficiency impairs neuronal energy metabolism and glucose utilization
  in brain'
- 'Step 3: Neuronal dysfunction and structural damage occur in memory and cognitive
  centers'
- 'Step 4: Cognitive decline manifests, particularly in memory performance, if thiamine
  deficiency is not corrected'
