  node_id: myelin_gene_expression
  node_name: Myelin-Related Gene Expression
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: ASC-conditioned medium is applied to TNF-damaged nerve tissue'
- 'Step 2: Bioactive factors in conditioned medium counteract inflammatory damage'
- 'Step 3: Krox-20 expression is restored and c-Jun is downregulated'
- 'Step 4: Myelin-related genes and corresponding proteins are upregulated'
- 'Step 5: Schwann cells regain myelinating capacity and produce myelin sheaths'
