category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Altered white matter development in superior cerebellar peduncle and superior
  longitudinal fasciculus disrupts neural connectivity'
- 'Step 2: Impaired structural connectivity affects signal transmission for motor
  regulation, learning, memory, and language processing'
- 'Step 3: Disrupted neural pathways manifest as physical, social, emotional, and
  cognitive difficulties'
- 'Step 4: These functional impairments emerge across the spectrum of fetal alcohol
  spectrum disorders during early childhood development'
