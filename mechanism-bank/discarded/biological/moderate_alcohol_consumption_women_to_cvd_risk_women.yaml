direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 standard drinks per day) creates cardioprotective
  physiological changes'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol at moderate levels may improve lipid profiles and reduce inflammatory
  markers'
- 'Step 3: These biological changes reduce overall cardiovascular disease morbidity
  and mortality risk'
- 'Step 4: Protective effects observed across multiple CVD outcomes in women'

  description: J-shaped relationship where 1-2 drinks/day is protective, but higher
    amounts increase CVD risk

  strength: moderate
  description: Except for hypertension, no sex-related differences reported, suggesting
    similar protective effects for women and men at moderate consumption levels
