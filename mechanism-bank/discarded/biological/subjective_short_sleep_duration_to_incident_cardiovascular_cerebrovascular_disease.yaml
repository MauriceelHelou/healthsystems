  node_id: incident_cardiovascular_cerebrovascular_disease
  node_name: Incident Cardiovascular and/or Cerebrovascular Disease
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Self-reported short sleep duration reflects subjective perception but may
  not capture objective biological sleep disruption'
- 'Step 2: Mismatch between subjective and objective sleep measures indicates sleep
  misperception or recall bias'
- 'Step 3: Absence of objective short sleep duration means cardiovascular systems
  maintain adequate recovery time'
- 'Step 4: No significant increase in incident cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease
  risk observed'

  description: Subjective self-reported sleep duration shows no association with cardiovascular
    disease risk, while objective polysomnography measurement shows strong association,
    indicating subjective measures fail to capture the biological phenotype at risk
