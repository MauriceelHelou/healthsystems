mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Paternal alcohol consumption before conception alters sperm quality and
  epigenetic markers'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced DNA damage and epigenetic modifications in sperm are transmitted
  at conception'
- 'Step 3: These genetic and epigenetic alterations affect early embryonic development'
- 'Step 4: Disrupted developmental processes manifest as structural birth defects
  in the fetus'
