to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_use_disorder
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Genetic variants associated with psychiatric disorders (depression, PTSD,
  anxiety) influence neurobiological systems regulating mood, stress response, and
  emotional regulation'
- 'Step 2: These shared genetic factors create overlapping vulnerability to both psychiatric
  conditions and alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders may use
  alcohol for self-medication, accelerating progression to disorder'
- 'Step 4: The positive genetic correlation with AUD (opposite to consumption) suggests
  disorder-specific biological pathways linking psychiatric risk and addiction vulnerability'
