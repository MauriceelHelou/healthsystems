direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Depression symptoms activate chronic stress response systems affecting
  lipid metabolism regulation'
- 'Step 2: HPA axis dysregulation and inflammatory processes alter hepatic lipid processing
  over decades'
- 'Step 3: Stress-related hormones influence LDL receptor expression and cholesterol
  synthesis'
- 'Step 4: Progressive metabolic dysregulation leads to clinically elevated cholesterol
  levels requiring diagnosis'
