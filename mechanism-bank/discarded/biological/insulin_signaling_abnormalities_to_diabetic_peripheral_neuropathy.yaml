direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Abnormalities in insulin receptor signaling pathways serve as initiating
  factors for pathophysiological changes'
- 'Step 2: Impaired insulin signaling inhibits neural axon repair mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Promotion of apoptosis in damaged neuronal cells'
- 'Step 4: Progressive peripheral nerve dysfunction due to inability to repair damage
  and increased cell death'
