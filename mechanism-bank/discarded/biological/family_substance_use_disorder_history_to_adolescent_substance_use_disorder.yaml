direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of SUD indicates genetic heritability of neurobiological
  vulnerabilities affecting reward pathways, impulse control, and stress response
  systems'
- 'Step 2: Families with SUD history often face accumulated exposure to structural
  risk factors including poverty, neighborhood disadvantage, and limited healthcare
  access'
- 'Step 3: Intergenerational trauma and adverse childhood experiences cluster in families
  affected by SUD, creating developmental vulnerabilities'
- 'Step 4: Genetic predisposition interacts with environmental stressors and limited
  protective factors to elevate adolescent SUD risk'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Having both parents with SUD (aRR=3.74) produces substantially higher
    risk than single parent, suggesting additive or synergistic effects of genetic
    loading and environmental adversity
- name: sibling_adolescent_onset
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Older sibling with adolescent-onset SUD (aRR=3.85) represents particularly
    high-risk indicator, possibly reflecting more severe shared genetic and environmental
    factors or recent-onset household stressors
