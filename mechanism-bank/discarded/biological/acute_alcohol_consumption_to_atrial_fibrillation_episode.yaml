to_node:
  node_id: atrial_fibrillation_episode
  node_name: Atrial Fibrillation Episode
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption leads to detectable blood alcohol concentration in
  the bloodstream'
- 'Step 2: Elevated blood alcohol levels create acute electrophysiological changes
  in cardiac tissue'
- 'Step 3: These changes alter atrial electrical conduction and increase atrial ectopy'
- 'Step 4: Disrupted electrical activity triggers discrete atrial fibrillation episodes'

- name: dose_response_relationship
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Higher alcohol doses show greater odds of AF episodes - 2 or more drinks
    associated with OR 3.58 (CI 1.63-7.89) compared to single drink OR 2.02
- name: time_window_exposure
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Recent consumption (preceding 4 hours) shows stronger association;
    total alcohol exposure over 12 hours also significant (OR 1.14 per 4.7% increase)
- name: peak_blood_alcohol_concentration
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Higher peak blood alcohol concentration associated with increased odds
    (OR 1.38 per 0.1% increase in BAC)
