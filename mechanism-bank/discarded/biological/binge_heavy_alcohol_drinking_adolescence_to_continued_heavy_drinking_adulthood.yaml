direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure during critical neurodevelopmental period disrupts
  normal brain maturation processes'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced alterations in developing brain structure and function,
  particularly in regions governing executive function and reward processing'
- 'Step 3: Impaired brain development creates neurobiological vulnerabilities that
  perpetuate alcohol use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Developmental insults to brain during adolescence establish neurological
  basis for sustained alcohol dependence into adulthood'
- 'Step 5: Brain changes from adolescent heavy drinking increase likelihood of continued
  problematic alcohol use throughout later life'
