to_node:
  node_id: alcohol_consumption_behavior
  node_name: Alcohol Consumption Behavior
direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: The ALDH2*2 allele (rs671 G>A mutation) produces a deficient aldehyde dehydrogenase
  enzyme'
- 'Step 2: Deficient ALDH2 enzyme leads to accumulation of acetaldehyde when alcohol
  is consumed'
- 'Step 3: Acetaldehyde accumulation causes unpleasant flushing reactions and discomfort'
- 'Step 4: This aversive physiological response serves as a biological deterrent to
  alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 5: Individuals with ALDH2*2 allele demonstrate lower hazardous drinking scores
  (AUDIT < 8 vs ≥ 8)'

- name: genetic_ancestry
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: This mechanism is specific to populations of East Asian ancestry where
    the ALDH2*2 allele is present. The allele is virtually absent in non-Asian populations,
    making this a population-specific protective factor.
- name: homozygous_vs_heterozygous
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Homozygous ALDH2*2 carriers (n=13 in Keelung, n=175 in Guangzhou) likely
    experience stronger protective effects against alcohol consumption compared to
    heterozygous carriers (n=81 in Keelung), though specific effect sizes not provided
    in abstract.
