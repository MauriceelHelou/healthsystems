direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Untreated or delayed treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy allows progression
  of neuronal damage in memory-critical brain structures'
- 'Step 2: Irreversible damage to mammillary bodies, thalamus, and hippocampal regions
  impairs memory consolidation and executive function'
- 'Step 3: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome develops with persistent confusion, ataxia,
  speech changes, and memory deficits'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged hospitalization and need for inpatient rehabilitation reflects
  severity of neurological disability'
