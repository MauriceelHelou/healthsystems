direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
  (NAFLD) adds direct hepatotoxic insult to pre-existing metabolic liver injury'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exacerbates hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress
  in already compromised liver tissue'
- 'Step 3: Combined metabolic and toxic injury accelerates progression from simple
  steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis'
- 'Step 4: This results in accelerated negative liver-related outcomes compared to
  NAFLD alone'
