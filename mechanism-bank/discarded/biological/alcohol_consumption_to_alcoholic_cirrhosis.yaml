  node_id: alcoholic_cirrhosis
  node_name: Alcoholic Cirrhosis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption causes direct hepatotoxic effects through acetaldehyde
  accumulation and oxidative stress in liver tissue'
- 'Step 2: Sustained alcohol exposure triggers inflammatory responses and hepatocyte
  death, leading to progressive liver fibrosis'
- 'Step 3: Continued fibrotic changes result in cirrhotic transformation of liver
  architecture with nodule formation and loss of normal liver function'

- name: male_sex
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: 76% of patients were male, suggesting potential sex-based differences
    in alcohol-related cirrhosis prevalence, potentially related to differential alcohol
    consumption patterns or biological susceptibility
- name: young_age
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: 25% of patients fell within 18-30 years age range, indicating early
    onset of alcohol-related liver disease in younger populations
