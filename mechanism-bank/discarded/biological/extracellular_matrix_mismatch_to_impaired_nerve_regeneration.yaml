direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Peripheral nerve regeneration has highly sensitive response to its surrounding
  microenvironment including topographical, biochemical, mechanical, and conductive
  signals'
- 'Step 2: When scaffolds fail to adequately replicate the natural extracellular matrix
  characteristics, cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation are impaired'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate biomaterial properties prevent proper nerve number restoration,
  myelin formation, and axon thickness development'
- 'Step 4: Suboptimal nerve regeneration results in incomplete functional recovery
  and persistent neuropathic symptoms'
