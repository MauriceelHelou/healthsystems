  node_id: treatment_resistant_saws
  node_name: Treatment-Resistant SAWS Cases
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Current SAWS management focuses primarily on γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
  pathway modulation'
- 'Step 2: Some patients have withdrawal symptoms mediated by non-GABA pathways (e.g.,
  glutamate, inflammatory, autonomic)'
- 'Step 3: GABA-focused treatments fail to adequately control withdrawal in these
  patients'
- 'Step 4: Persistent severe withdrawal symptoms despite escalating GABA-ergic medications
  lead to prolonged morbidity'
