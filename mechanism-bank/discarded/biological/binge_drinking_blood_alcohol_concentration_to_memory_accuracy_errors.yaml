direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High blood alcohol concentration during adolescence disrupts neural circuits
  involved in error monitoring and response inhibition'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol-induced changes in prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity impair the
  accuracy of memory encoding and retrieval processes'
- 'Step 3: Weakened executive control over memory processes leads to increased intrusions
  and false recognitions during recall tasks'
- 'Step 4: Adolescent binge drinkers produce more precision errors on verbal memory
  assessments compared to non-binge drinkers'
