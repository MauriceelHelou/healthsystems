direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Paternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy period serves as a negative
  control exposure (no direct biological pathway to fetus)'
- 'Step 2: Association with paternal drinking indicates presence of unmeasured confounding
  factors shared within families'
- 'Step 3: These confounding factors may include socioeconomic conditions, environmental
  exposures, genetic factors, or shared health behaviors'
- 'Step 4: The similar pattern to pre-conception findings suggests non-causal mechanisms
  underlying observed associations'
