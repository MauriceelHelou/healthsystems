  node_id: alcohol_dependency

to_node:
  node_id: mixed_neuropathy
  node_name: Combined Large and Small Fiber Neuropathy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prolonged alcohol neurotoxicity affects multiple nerve fiber types simultaneously'
- 'Step 2: Both myelinated large fibers and unmyelinated small fibers undergo degeneration'
- 'Step 3: Damage to large fibers impairs vibration/proprioception while small fiber
  damage affects pain/temperature sensation'
- 'Step 4: Combined pathology results in mixed neuropathy with both types of sensory
  deficits'
