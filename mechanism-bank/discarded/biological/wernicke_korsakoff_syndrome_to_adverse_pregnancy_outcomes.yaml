direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome reflects severe nutritional deficiency
  state affecting multiple micronutrients'
- 'Step 2: Maternal malnutrition and cognitive impairment affect placental function
  and fetal nutrient transfer'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate maternal nutritional status leads to reduced amniotic fluid
  production (oligohydramnios)'
- 'Step 4: Chronic nutrient insufficiency causes intrauterine growth retardation with
  low birth weight outcome (2.2 kg at 36 weeks)'
