  node_id: fetal_alcohol_syndrome

direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Different alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, liquor) vary in ethanol concentration,
  consumption patterns, and accompanying nutritional components'
- 'Step 2: Higher concentration beverages (liquor) may result in higher peak blood
  alcohol levels affecting fetal exposure intensity'
- 'Step 3: Drinking patterns associated with different beverage types (e.g., binge
  drinking with liquor vs. regular wine consumption) create different temporal exposure
  profiles'
- 'Step 4: Variation in congeners, additives, and co-consumed substances across beverage
  types may modify teratogenic effects'
