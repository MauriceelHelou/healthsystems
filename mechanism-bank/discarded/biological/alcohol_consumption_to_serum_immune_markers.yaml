direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol consumption triggers inflammatory cascades in pancreatic tissue'
- 'Step 2: Sustained alcohol exposure leads to activation of immune cells and cytokine
  production'
- 'Step 3: Immune activation results in detectable changes in serum immune marker
  profiles'
- 'Step 4: Multiple immune markers show associations with alcohol exposure status
  across the pancreatitis continuum'
