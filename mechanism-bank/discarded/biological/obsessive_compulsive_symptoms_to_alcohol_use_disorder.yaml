direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Obsessive-compulsive symptoms create intrusive thoughts and compulsive
  behaviors that generate significant psychological distress'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents with limited access to mental health treatment may attempt
  to self-medicate distressing OC symptoms through alcohol use'
- 'Step 3: Repeated alcohol use as a coping mechanism for OC symptoms increases risk
  of developing alcohol use disorder'
- 'Step 4: Neurobiological overlap in reward and stress-response systems between OCD
  and addiction pathways reinforces comorbidity'
