direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoking introduces carcinogens and inflammatory mediators that
  affect pancreatic tissue through systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Nicotine and tobacco toxins cause oxidative stress and microvascular damage
  in the pancreaticoduodenal groove region'
- 'Step 3: Chronic exposure leads to progressive inflammation and fibrotic changes
  in the groove area'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative tissue damage results in development of groove pancreatitis
  with characteristic groove region involvement'
