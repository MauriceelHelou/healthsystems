direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Conditions associated with compromised vascular perfusion (diabetes, chronic
  kidney disease, advanced age, hypertension, shock states) reduce blood flow to esophageal
  mucosa'
- 'Step 2: Reduced perfusion creates vulnerability to ischemic injury and impairs
  protective mucosal barriers'
- 'Step 3: Acute ischemic event triggers mucosal necrosis in the distal esophagus,
  manifesting as acute esophageal necrosis'
