direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Combined therapy reduces chronic widespread pain through modulation of
  central sensitization'
- 'Step 2: Improved sleep quality enhances daytime functioning and reduces fatigue'
- 'Step 3: Reduced pain and improved sleep enable greater physical function and daily
  activity participation'
- 'Step 4: Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores improve, indicating reduced
  disability and improved quality of life'
