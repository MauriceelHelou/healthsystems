to_node:
  node_id: neuropathic_pain
  node_name: Neuropathic Pain
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: DMS metabolized de novo from sphingosine accumulates in spinal cord tissue'
- 'Step 2: DMS enhances binding affinity between nerve growth factor (NGF) and tropomyosin
  receptor kinase A (trkA)'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced NGF-trkA binding leads to phosphorylation of trkA receptors'
- 'Step 4: trkA phosphorylation promotes neurite outgrowth of epidermal nerve fibers'
- 'Step 5: Excessive neurite outgrowth and NGF-trkA signaling produces chronic neuropathic
  pain behavior'
