direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol consumption increases blood pressure through activation
  of sympathetic nervous system and disruption of vascular regulation'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol promotes thrombosis through effects on platelet function and coagulation
  cascade'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol-related cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation increase risk of
  cardioembolic stroke'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative vascular damage and prothrombotic state increase acute ischemic
  stroke incidence'
