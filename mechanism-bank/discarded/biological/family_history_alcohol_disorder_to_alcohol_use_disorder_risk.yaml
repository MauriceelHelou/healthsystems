direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of alcohol dependence indicates both genetic transmission
  of vulnerability alleles and shared environmental risk factors'
- 'Step 2: Inherited neurobiological alterations increase susceptibility to addiction
  phenotypes including enhanced cue reactivity and compulsive seeking'
- 'Step 3: Individuals with family history show elevated motivated responding to alcohol
  and faster conditioning to alcohol-related cues'
- 'Step 4: Combined genetic and environmental factors from family context elevate
  overall risk for developing alcohol use disorder'
