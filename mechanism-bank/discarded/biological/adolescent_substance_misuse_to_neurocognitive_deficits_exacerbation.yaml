direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Substance exposure during critical neurodevelopmental periods disrupts
  ongoing brain maturation processes'
- 'Step 2: Adolescent substance use affects neurobiological systems including cognitive
  control and emotional regulation circuits'
- 'Step 3: Repeated substance exposure exacerbates pre-existing neurocognitive vulnerabilities
  through neurotoxic effects'
- 'Step 4: Progressive deterioration of neurocognitive function creates cycle of increased
  substance use and worsening deficits'

  description: Pre-existing deficits may increase vulnerability to neurotoxic effects
    of substance use, with those starting with greater vulnerabilities experiencing
    more severe exacerbation
- name: age_of_onset
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Earlier onset during critical neurodevelopmental periods (11-13 years)
    likely results in greater exacerbation of deficits due to disruption of ongoing
    maturation
