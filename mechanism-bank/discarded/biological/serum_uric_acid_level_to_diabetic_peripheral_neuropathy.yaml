direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Uric acid functions as a natural antioxidant that protects against oxidative
  stress in the body'
- 'Step 2: Oxidative stress is a critical factor contributing to neuronal damage in
  diabetic patients'
- 'Step 3: Lower serum uric acid levels reduce antioxidant capacity, allowing increased
  oxidative stress'
- 'Step 4: Increased oxidative stress leads to progressive neuronal damage and diabetic
  peripheral neuropathy development'

  description: The negative association between serum uric acid and motor conduction
    velocity persisted even after adjusting for HbA1c, suggesting the mechanism operates
    independently of glycemic control
