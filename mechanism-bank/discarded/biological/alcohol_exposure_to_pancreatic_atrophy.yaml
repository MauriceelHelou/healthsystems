  node_id: pancreatic_atrophy
  node_name: Pancreatic Atrophy
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol exposure contributes to development of chronic pancreatitis through
  direct toxic effects on pancreatic tissue and repeated inflammatory episodes'
- 'Step 2: Chronic inflammation and repeated injury lead to progressive fibrosis and
  destruction of pancreatic parenchyma'
- 'Step 3: Loss of functional pancreatic tissue results in measurable reduction in
  pancreatic dimensions (atrophy), particularly in the head and body regions'
