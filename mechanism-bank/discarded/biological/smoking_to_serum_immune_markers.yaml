mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Tobacco smoke contains toxins and pro-inflammatory compounds that enter
  systemic circulation'
- 'Step 2: Smoking induces oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in pancreatic
  and immune cells'
- 'Step 3: Chronic smoking exposure modifies immune cell activation and cytokine production
  patterns'
- 'Step 4: These immunological changes manifest as altered serum immune marker profiles
  in pancreatitis patients'
