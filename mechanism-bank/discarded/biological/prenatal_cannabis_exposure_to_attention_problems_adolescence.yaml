direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Cannabis exposure during prenatal period affects fetal neurodevelopment
  through cannabinoid receptor interactions in developing brain'
- 'Step 2: Altered neurodevelopmental trajectories persist through childhood without
  detectable changes in cognitive performance or fMRI brain activation patterns at
  ages 9-10'
- 'Step 3: By early adolescence (ages 9-10), exposed children demonstrate significantly
  elevated attention problems on standardized behavioral assessments (CBCL)'
- 'Step 4: Behavioral manifestations occur independently of specific cognitive deficits,
  consistent with heterogeneous presentation of attention disorders'
