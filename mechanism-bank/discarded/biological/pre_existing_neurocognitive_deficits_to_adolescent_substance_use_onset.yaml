direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pre-adolescents with neurocognitive and emotional regulatory deficits have
  reduced capacity for impulse control and decision-making'
- 'Step 2: These baseline neurobiological vulnerabilities increase susceptibility
  to initiating substance use when exposed to availability and social contexts'
- 'Step 3: Deficits in emotional regulation reduce ability to cope with stress through
  non-substance mechanisms'
- 'Step 4: Combined neurocognitive and regulatory deficits contribute to both onset
  and escalation patterns of substance misuse'

  description: Study used targeted recruitment to bolster numbers of pre-adolescents
    at increased risk of substance use, suggesting risk status moderates the pathway
