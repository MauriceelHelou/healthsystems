direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pesticide exposure simultaneously disrupts peritrophic matrix barrier and
  suppresses immune pathways'
- 'Step 2: Dual disruption allows pathogenic bacterial invasion while reducing antimicrobial
  defenses'
- 'Step 3: Altered gut microbial community structure increases conditional pathogen
  abundance'
- 'Step 4: Following infection with Enterobacter cloacae, exposed individuals exhibit
  significantly lower body weight and higher mortality'
