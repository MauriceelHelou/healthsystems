direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: RYGB alters gastrointestinal anatomy affecting alcohol absorption and metabolism'
- 'Step 2: Changes in alcohol pharmacokinetics lead to higher peak blood alcohol levels
  and altered subjective effects'
- 'Step 3: Neurobiological reward pathways are affected by both surgical changes and
  altered alcohol response'
- 'Step 4: Increased vulnerability to developing alcohol use disorder post-surgery'
