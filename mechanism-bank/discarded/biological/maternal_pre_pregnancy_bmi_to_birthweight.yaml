- 'Step 1: Maternal pre-pregnancy obesity creates altered metabolic and hormonal environment
  during pregnancy'
- 'Step 2: This environment affects fetal growth patterns and metabolic programming'
- 'Step 3: DNA methylation changes in cord blood reflect these developmental alterations'
- 'Step 4: These epigenetic and metabolic changes influence fetal growth and birthweight'
