to_node:
  node_id: aospd_with_cp_risk
  node_name: AOSPD with Chronic Pancreatitis Risk
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Smoking and alcohol consumption act synergistically to cause pancreatic
  injury through oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways'
- 'Step 2: Combined exposures accelerate progression of chronic pancreatitis with
  more severe duct damage and calcification'
- 'Step 3: More severe structural pancreatic changes increase risk of complete duct
  obstruction'
- 'Step 4: Smoking-related immune dysfunction may increase susceptibility to bacterial
  infection in obstructed ducts, facilitating progression to suppurative ductitis'
