direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Physiological modifications in sleep regulation occur during adolescent
  development, affecting circadian rhythm timing'
- 'Step 2: Circadian rhythm changes shift sleep-wake cycles later in adolescence (delayed
  sleep phase)'
- 'Step 3: Delayed sleep phase conflicts with early school start times and social
  obligations'
- 'Step 4: Mismatch between biological sleep timing and environmental demands leads
  to insufficient sleep duration'
