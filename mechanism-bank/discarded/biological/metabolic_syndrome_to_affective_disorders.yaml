direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Metabolic syndrome creates systemic physiological dysregulation including
  central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance'
- 'Step 2: Metabolic syndrome is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation as
  evidenced by altered inflammatory markers'
- 'Step 3: Chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic dysfunction disrupt neurobiological
  processes and neurotransmitter systems'
- 'Step 4: These biological alterations increase vulnerability to developing affective
  disorders, acting as a risk factor prior to disorder onset'

  description: High-risk twins (unaffected co-twins with familial risk) showed 15%
    MetS prevalence compared to 2.5% in low-risk twins, suggesting genetic predisposition
    moderates the relationship
