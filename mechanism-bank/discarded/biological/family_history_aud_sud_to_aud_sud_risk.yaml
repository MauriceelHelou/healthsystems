- 'Step 1: Family history of AUD/SUD disrupts neuroendocrine regulation'
- 'Step 2: Neuroendocrine dysregulation alters immune system function, increasing
  circulating leukocytes'
- 'Step 3: Immune dysregulation and inflammation contribute to neurocognitive alterations
  and blunted stress reactivity'
- 'Step 4: Altered brain function and stress response systems increase vulnerability
  to developing AUD/SUD'
