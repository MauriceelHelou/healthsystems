to_node:
  node_id: neurocognitive_delays
  node_name: Neurocognitive Delays
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts fetal brain development during critical
  neurodevelopmental windows'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol interferes with neuronal migration, synaptogenesis, and myelination
  processes'
- 'Step 3: These disruptions manifest as neurocognitive delays including deficits
  in executive function, memory, attention, and processing speed'
- 'Step 4: These neurocognitive impairments persist into childhood and school age
  as core features of FASD'
