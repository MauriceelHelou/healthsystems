direction: negative
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High blood alcohol concentration during binge drinking episodes exposes
  the incompletely matured adolescent brain to neurotoxic effects'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol exposure leads to structural and functional changes in brain regions
  critical for memory consolidation and retrieval'
- 'Step 3: These neurobiological changes impair the encoding, storage, and recall
  processes underlying verbal memory tasks'
- 'Step 4: Adolescents with high BAC history demonstrate diminished performance on
  verbal learning tests compared to low/no BAC peers'
