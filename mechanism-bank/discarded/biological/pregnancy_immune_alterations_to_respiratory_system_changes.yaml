direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregnancy induces physiological changes in anatomical structure of respiratory
  system'
- 'Step 2: Anatomical changes include diaphragm elevation, decreased functional residual
  capacity, and increased oxygen consumption'
- 'Step 3: These structural changes compromise respiratory reserve and ventilation
  capacity'
- 'Step 4: Combined with immune alterations, respiratory changes increase vulnerability
  to severe respiratory viral infections'
