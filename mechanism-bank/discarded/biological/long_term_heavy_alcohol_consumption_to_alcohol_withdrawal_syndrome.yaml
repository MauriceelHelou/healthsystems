direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic alcohol exposure leads to neuroadaptive changes in the central
  nervous system'
- 'Step 2: Glutamate receptor up-regulation and increased glutamatergic activation
  occur as compensatory mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Significant decrease or cessation of alcohol consumption removes depressant
  effects'
- 'Step 4: Unopposed excitatory neurotransmission produces withdrawal symptoms in
  up to 50% of individuals'
