  node_id: peritrophic_matrix_disruption
  node_name: Peritrophic Matrix Disruption
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chlorantraniliprole exposure significantly decreases trehalase activity
  in the midgut'
- 'Step 2: Exposure increases activities of chitinase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase,
  and chitin deacetylase enzymes'
- 'Step 3: Altered enzyme activities result in decreased chitin content in the peritrophic
  matrix'
- 'Step 4: Loss of chitin structural integrity leads to physical disruption of the
  peritrophic matrix barrier'
