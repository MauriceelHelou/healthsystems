- 'Step 1: Metformin treatment affects cellular metabolism in neural tissue'
- 'Step 2: Preservation of axonal diameter and myelin sheath thickness in sciatic
  nerves'
- 'Step 3: Maintained myelinated fiber diameter prevents nerve conduction deficits'
- 'Step 4: Structural integrity preservation translates to functional sensory capacity'
