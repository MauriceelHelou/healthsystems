  node_name: Chronic Pancreatitis
direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol and its metabolites directly damage pancreatic tissue through toxic
  effects'
- 'Step 2: Chronic exposure leads to inflammatory processes in the pancreas'
- 'Step 3: Continued inflammation results in irreversible structural changes to pancreatic
  tissue'
- 'Step 4: Progressive destruction leads to excretory and incretory insufficiency
  manifesting as chronic pancreatitis'
