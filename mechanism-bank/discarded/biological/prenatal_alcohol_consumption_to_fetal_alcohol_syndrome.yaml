direction: positive
category: biological
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and reaches fetal circulation at
  concentrations similar to maternal blood levels'
- 'Step 2: Fetal liver lacks mature enzymes to metabolize alcohol, prolonging exposure
  and toxic effects'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol disrupts cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation during
  critical periods of organogenesis and brain development'
- 'Step 4: Teratogenic effects result in fetal alcohol syndrome including craniofacial
  abnormalities, growth restriction, and neurodevelopmental impairment'
