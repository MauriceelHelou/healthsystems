direction: 'null'
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of liquor stores in residential neighborhoods theoretically
  increases physical accessibility to alcohol sources'
- 'Step 2: Increased outlet density could create normalization of alcohol availability
  in the built environment and reduce perceived barriers to access'
- 'Step 3: However, the study found no significant association between outlet density
  and any binge drinking trajectory, suggesting physical proximity alone may not be
  the primary mechanism for underage access'
- 'Step 4: This null finding suggests that regulatory enforcement (e.g., age verification)
  and other structural barriers may be more important than spatial proximity in determining
  youth alcohol access'
