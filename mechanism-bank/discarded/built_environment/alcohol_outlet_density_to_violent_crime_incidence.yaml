mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Concentration of alcohol outlets in urban areas increases availability
  and consumption of alcohol in public and semi-public spaces'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol consumption impairs judgment and increases aggression among individuals
  in concentrated nighttime economy zones'
- 'Step 3: Clustering of intoxicated individuals in areas with limited social control
  creates opportunities for interpersonal conflicts'
- 'Step 4: These conflicts escalate to violent incidents including assaults and other
  violent crimes'
