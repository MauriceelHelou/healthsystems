direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates lack of secure shelter and basic living conditions'
- 'Step 2: Absence of stable housing leads to exposure to environmental hazards, violence,
  and extreme weather'
- 'Step 3: Lack of housing prevents access to healthcare services and medication storage/adherence'
- 'Step 4: These combined structural barriers result in increased mortality risk'
