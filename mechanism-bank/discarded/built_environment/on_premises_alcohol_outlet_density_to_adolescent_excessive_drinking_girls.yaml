mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing vouchers lead families to move to census tracts with higher on-premises
  alcohol outlet density (bars, restaurants)'
- 'Step 2: Despite higher on-premises outlet density, MTO treatment decreased drinking
  for girls through alcohol outlet density mediation at higher density levels'
- 'Step 3: On-premises outlets may have different access barriers for adolescents
  compared to off-premises outlets (age verification, supervised consumption)'
- 'Step 4: The overall outlet environment configuration at higher densities mediates
  protective effects for girls receiving housing vouchers'
