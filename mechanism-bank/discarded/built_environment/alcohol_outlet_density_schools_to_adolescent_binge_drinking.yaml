direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets in school neighborhoods increases physical
  availability and accessibility of alcohol to adolescents'
- 'Step 2: Greater outlet density normalizes alcohol consumption through increased
  visibility and marketing exposure in youth environments'
- 'Step 3: Easier access reduces barriers to purchase and creates more opportunities
  for alcohol acquisition by adolescents or their peers'
- 'Step 4: Increased exposure and reduced acquisition barriers lead to higher rates
  of binge drinking among adolescents'
