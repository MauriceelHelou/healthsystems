direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Bars/taverns operating during late-night hours (particularly after 10pm
  until early morning) create geographic focal points for social congregation'
- 'Step 2: These outlets concentrate people in public spaces during hours associated
  with higher rates of alcohol consumption and intoxication'
- 'Step 3: Spatial clustering of intoxicated individuals around alcohol outlets increases
  density of potential violence-triggering interpersonal interactions'
- 'Step 4: Violent crimes (homicide, robbery, assault, rape) cluster within 800-ft
  buffer zones around alcohol outlets during late-night hours (8pm-4am)'

moderators:
- name: alcohol_outlet_density
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Treatment neighborhood had 26 bars/taverns while control areas had
    41, suggesting outlet density moderates the spatial concentration effect
- name: neighborhood_disadvantage
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Control neighborhoods were matched on neighborhood disadvantage score,
    suggesting this structural factor may moderate the relationship between alcohol
    availability and crime clustering
- name: temporal_window
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: Effects specifically measured during 8pm-4am window, indicating late-night
    hours significantly strengthen the relationship between alcohol outlets and violent
    crime
