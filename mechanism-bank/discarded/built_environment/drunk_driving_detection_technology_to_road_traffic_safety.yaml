mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Multi-sensor fusion technology installed in vehicle steering wheels continuously
  monitors driver alcohol exposure through gas diffusion detection'
- 'Step 2: Data fusion algorithms process sensor array inputs to accurately identify
  when drivers have consumed alcohol (>50mL threshold)'
- 'Step 3: System provides real-time voice warnings and automatically locks vehicle
  to prevent operation by intoxicated drivers'
- 'Step 4: Prevention of drunk driving incidents reduces traffic crashes, injuries,
  and fatalities'
