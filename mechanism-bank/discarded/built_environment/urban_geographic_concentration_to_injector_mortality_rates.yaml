direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban areas concentrate populations experiencing homelessness, poverty,
  and drug use due to availability of services and drug markets'
- 'Step 2: High concentration creates strain on limited harm reduction and treatment
  infrastructure, reducing per-capita service availability'
- 'Step 3: Urban housing crises create unstable living conditions and homelessness
  among people who inject drugs'
- 'Step 4: Spatial concentration of risk factors without proportional service expansion
  results in elevated mortality rates'

    may overwhelm capacity, and some evidence suggests rural areas have even less
