direction: 'null'
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher alcohol outlet density theoretically increases physical availability
  and accessibility of alcohol products in neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: Greater availability could reduce time and effort costs associated with
  purchasing alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure to alcohol marketing and visual cues in high-outlet-density
  areas could normalize consumption'
- 'Step 4: However, this study found NO significant within-pair association between
  outlet density and hazardous drinking when controlling for genetic and shared environmental
  factors'

  description: The null finding after controlling for genetic and shared environmental
    factors suggests that previous observed associations between outlet density and
    drinking may be confounded by selection effects—individuals with genetic predisposition
    to alcohol use may select into or remain in neighborhoods with higher outlet density
