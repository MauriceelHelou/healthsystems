direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of stable housing eliminates private, safe spaces for drug consumption,
  forcing people to use in public or high-risk environments'
- 'Step 2: Housing instability disrupts social support networks and access to harm
  reduction resources like naloxone and clean supplies'
- 'Step 3: Unstable housing increases likelihood of using alone, reducing chances
  of overdose reversal by bystanders'
- 'Step 4: These environmental conditions increase risk of overdose and other opioid-related
  health complications'
