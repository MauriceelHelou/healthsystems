direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of licensed alcohol premises in an area increases physical
  availability and access to alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 2: Greater spatial proximity reduces travel time and effort required to purchase
  alcohol at licensed establishments'
- 'Step 3: Increased convenience and visibility of alcohol venues normalizes alcohol
  consumption as a social activity'
- 'Step 4: Structural availability drives higher household expenditures on alcohol
  purchased at licensed premises'
