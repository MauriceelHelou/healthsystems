direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability disrupts access to supervised consumption environments
  and harm reduction services'
- 'Step 2: Unstable housing increases risk of using substances alone without support
  or emergency response capability'
- 'Step 3: Lack of secure storage increases risk of consuming substances of unknown
  potency or contamination'
- 'Step 4: Housing instability reduces continuity of medication-assisted treatment
  and medical monitoring for opioid use disorder'
