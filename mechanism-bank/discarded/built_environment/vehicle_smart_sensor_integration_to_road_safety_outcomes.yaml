- 'Step 1: Smart city infrastructure enables integration of multiple sensor systems
  in vehicles (alcohol detection, ignition control, alarm systems)'
- 'Step 2: Fuzzy logic algorithms process sensor data to make nuanced decisions about
  driver impairment levels rather than binary thresholds'
- 'Step 3: Associated sensor systems work together to prevent vehicle operation, alert
  authorities, and document incidents'
- 'Step 4: Smart city infrastructure supports wireless communication and coordinated
  response systems'
- 'Step 5: Comprehensive technology integration creates multiple barriers to drunk
  driving and improves overall road safety'
