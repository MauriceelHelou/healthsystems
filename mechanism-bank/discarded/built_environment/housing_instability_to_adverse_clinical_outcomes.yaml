direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates barriers to consistent healthcare engagement
  and appointment attendance'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing environment prevents proper medication storage and
  adherence to treatment regimens'
- 'Step 3: Housing instability increases stress and trauma exposure which exacerbates
  existing health conditions'
- 'Step 4: These structural barriers result in worse disease management and increased
  adverse clinical outcomes'
