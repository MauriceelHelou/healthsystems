direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher outlet density may indicate more commercial activity and neighborhood
  vitality'
- 'Step 2: Commercial activity creates social gathering places and opportunities for
  social interaction'
- 'Step 3: Increased social connection and reduced isolation may provide protective
  mental health effects'
- 'Step 4: However, mechanism unclear and may reflect unmeasured confounding or reverse
  causation requiring further research'
