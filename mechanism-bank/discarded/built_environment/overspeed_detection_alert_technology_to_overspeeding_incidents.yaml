mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: GPS and ESP32 system monitors vehicle speed in real-time with >95% detection
  accuracy'
- 'Step 2: When overspeeding is detected, system immediately triggers automated email
  alerts'
- 'Step 3: Real-time notifications sent to relevant stakeholders (authorities, fleet
  managers, or vehicle owners)'
- 'Step 4: Immediate feedback and accountability mechanisms cultivate responsible
  driving habits'
- 'Step 5: Sustained monitoring and alerting reduces frequency of overspeeding behaviors'
