direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Introduction of low-alcohol (<0.5%) beer and wine products increases availability
  of lower-risk alternatives in retail environments'
- 'Step 2: Some consumers substitute low-alcohol beverages for higher-strength alcoholic
  products'
- 'Step 3: Substitution reduces overall pure alcohol consumption among those who switch
  products'
- 'Step 4: Modest reductions in population-level alcohol exposure lead to small decreases
  in alcohol-attributable mortality'
