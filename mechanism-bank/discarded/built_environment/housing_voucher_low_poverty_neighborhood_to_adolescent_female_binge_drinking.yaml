direction: negative
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing vouchers enable families to relocate from public housing to lower-poverty
  neighborhoods (tract poverty <10%)'
- 'Step 2: Lower-poverty neighborhoods provide reduced exposure to neighborhood-level
  alcohol availability and social norms around substance use for adolescent girls'
- 'Step 3: Reduced structural exposure to alcohol-related environmental cues and improved
  neighborhood protective factors decrease opportunities and social pressures for
  binge drinking among female adolescents'
- 'Step 4: Gender-specific protective social environments in lower-poverty neighborhoods
  particularly benefit girls through differential peer networks and social supervision
  patterns'
