mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of alcohol outlets increases neighborhood exposure to alcohol-related
  activities and commercial presence'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol outlets serve as environmental cues and normalize alcohol use in
  the community context'
- 'Step 3: Concentrated alcohol availability creates neighborhood conditions conducive
  to social disorder and antisocial modeling'
- 'Step 4: Children exposed to these neighborhood conditions develop conduct problems
  through environmental learning and stress exposure'
