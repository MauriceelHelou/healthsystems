direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High density of on-premises alcohol outlets (bars, restaurants) creates
  pervasive environmental cues and normalized drinking contexts'
- 'Step 2: Increased environmental permissiveness and alcohol availability reduces
  barriers to alcohol access'
- 'Step 3: Genetic factors become more influential in determining alcohol problems
  when environmental constraints are removed'
- 'Step 4: Heritability estimates increase from 11% in zero-outlet neighborhoods to
  78% in high-outlet-density neighborhoods'

- name: zero_outlet_neighborhoods
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: 'In neighborhoods with no on-premises outlets, heritability of alcohol
    problems was only 11% (95% CI: 0-29%), demonstrating that restrictive built environments
    can substantially suppress genetic expression and environmental influences become
    more dominant.'
- name: population_density
  direction: u_shaped
  strength: weak
  description: The moderating effect of outlet density was independent of population
    density, indicating the mechanism operates through alcohol-specific availability
    rather than general urbanization.
- name: neighborhood_sociodemographic_characteristics
  direction: u_shaped
  strength: weak
  description: Effect persisted after controlling for neighborhood socio-demographic
    characteristics, suggesting outlet density operates as an independent structural
    determinant beyond general neighborhood disadvantage.
