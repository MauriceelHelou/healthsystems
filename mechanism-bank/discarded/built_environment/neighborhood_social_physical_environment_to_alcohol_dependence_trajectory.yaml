mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhood social and physical environments are shaped by historical
  investment patterns, zoning policies, and resource allocation'
- 'Step 2: Poor quality environments combine multiple risk factors: high outlet density,
  concentrated poverty, limited services, and social disorganization'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative environmental exposures create chronic stress while limiting
  access to recovery-supportive resources'
- 'Step 4: These structural conditions shape alcohol dependence trajectories across
  the life course, determining who achieves stable recovery versus chronic high dependence'
