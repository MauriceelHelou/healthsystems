- 'Step 1: Vehicle prevalence, design characteristics, and integrated safety features
  shape the risk environment for all drivers'
- 'Step 2: Safety features (e.g., crash avoidance systems, structural integrity) reduce
  crash likelihood or severity when impairment is present'
- 'Step 3: Design elements that enhance ease of operation reduce cognitive demands
  on impaired drivers'
- 'Step 4: Improved vehicle safety infrastructure mitigates consequences of impaired
  driving at the technological/engineering level'
