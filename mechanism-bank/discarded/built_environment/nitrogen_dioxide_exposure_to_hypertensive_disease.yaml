direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chronic NO2 exposure triggers sustained systemic inflammation and oxidative
  stress affecting vascular endothelium'
- 'Step 2: Endothelial dysfunction reduces nitric oxide bioavailability and impairs
  vasodilation'
- 'Step 3: Increased vascular resistance and arterial stiffness develop due to chronic
  inflammation and vascular remodeling'
- 'Step 4: Elevated systemic vascular resistance manifests as sustained hypertension
  and hypertensive disease'
