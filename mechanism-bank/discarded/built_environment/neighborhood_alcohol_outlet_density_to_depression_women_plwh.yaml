direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High concentration of alcohol outlets contributes to neighborhood disorder,
  social disorganization, and reduced social cohesion in residential areas'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol outlet density is associated with increased crime, violence, noise,
  and other social stressors that create chronic psychological burden for residents'
- 'Step 3: Women living with HIV in these neighborhoods experience compounded stress
  from environmental disorder, HIV-related stigma, and potential exposure to interpersonal
  violence in and around alcohol outlets'
- 'Step 4: Chronic exposure to neighborhood stressors and reduced sense of safety
  elevates risk for depression among women through sustained activation of stress
  response pathways'
