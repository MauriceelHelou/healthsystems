- 'Step 1: Retail geography shapes where different types of businesses, including
  alcohol outlets, locate within neighborhoods'
- 'Step 2: The spatial clustering of retail activities creates zones of commercial
  activity with varying levels of foot traffic and social mixing'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol outlets embedded within retail zones contribute to alcohol-related
  harms through both their specific effects and general retail activity effects'
- 'Step 4: However, alcohol outlets demonstrate harm-producing effects that exceed
  those of general retail, indicating unique mechanisms related to alcohol availability'
