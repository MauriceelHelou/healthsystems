direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: On-premise outlets (bars, restaurants) concentrate alcohol consumption
  within supervised establishments'
- 'Step 2: Staff and management provide some level of guardianship and crowd control
  within venues'
- 'Step 3: Establishments have incentive to maintain order to preserve licenses and
  business reputation'
- 'Step 4: However, congregation of intoxicated patrons entering/exiting establishments
  and nearby streets still creates opportunities for violent encounters, though to
  lesser degree than off-premise outlets'
