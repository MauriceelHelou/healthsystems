- 'Step 1: Vehicle prevalence, design characteristics, and integrated safety features
  constitute the technological environment'
- 'Step 2: Safety features modify crash likelihood through improved vehicle handling,
  stability, and crash avoidance systems'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced vehicle safety design provides protective buffer against impairment-related
  driving errors'
- 'Step 4: Reduced crash occurrence rates result from technological compensation for
  driver impairment'
