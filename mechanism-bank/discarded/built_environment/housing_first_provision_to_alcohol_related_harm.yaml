- 'Step 1: Housing First provides permanent housing without requiring sobriety, allowing
  residents with chronic alcohol use disorder to age in place'
- 'Step 2: Residents maintain continuous alcohol use in housing context without comprehensive
  harm reduction services'

  difficulties'
- 'Step 4: Health services may not adequately meet needs of those whose health is
  particularly compromised by ongoing alcohol use'
