direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Larger floor area liquor stores (warehouse-style) provide greater product
  variety, volume discounts, and promotional opportunities'
- 'Step 2: Increased product selection and lower per-unit prices reduce barriers to
  alcohol purchase'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced retail environment and marketing exposure increase alcohol acquisition
  opportunities'
- 'Step 4: Greater alcohol availability and affordability in the immediate environment
  leads to increased consumption patterns among young adults'
