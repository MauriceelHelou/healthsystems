- 'Step 1: Entering a housing program provides physical shelter and stability during
  critical transition period'
- 'Step 2: Housing stability creates opportunity to reduce substance use through reduced
  environmental stressors'
- 'Step 3: Stable housing enables strengthening of prosocial supportive connections'
- 'Step 4: Reduced substance use and increased supportive connections decrease risk
  of re-entering homelessness'
