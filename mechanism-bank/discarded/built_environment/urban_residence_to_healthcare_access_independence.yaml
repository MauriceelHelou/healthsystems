  node_name: Independence from Geographic Barriers to Healthcare Access
direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Urban areas have higher density and proximity of health facilities, reducing
  geographic distance barriers'
- 'Step 2: Multiple transportation options (public and private) and better infrastructure
  in urban settings increase accessibility regardless of facility distance'
- 'Step 3: Greater availability of alternative care sites and providers in urban areas
  provides redundancy in access points'
- 'Step 4: These structural advantages buffer urban residents from the negative effects
  of distance to any single health facility'

  description: In urban areas, routine activities showed significant association with
    dental health conditions (p=0.002), suggesting that social and economic activity
    patterns in urban settings may facilitate healthcare access through multiple pathways
