direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Non-alcohol urban points of interest (e.g., entertainment venues, restaurants,
  transit hubs) concentrate large numbers of people in specific urban areas'
- 'Step 2: These points of interest create footfall patterns that overlap with alcohol
  consumption economy zones in city centers'
- 'Step 3: High density of diverse points of interest extends the temporal and spatial
  range of nighttime economy activity'
- 'Step 4: Increased mixing of diverse populations in uncontrolled environments creates
  additional opportunities for interpersonal conflicts and violent incidents'
