mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Drinking occasions that extend later into night hours provide longer duration
  for alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: Extended drinking duration allows cumulative alcohol intake to increase'
- 'Step 3: Mean estimated blood alcohol concentration strongly increases as ending
  time extends later into night'
