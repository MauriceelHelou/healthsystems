mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing vouchers enable families to move from public housing to census
  tracts with lower off-premises alcohol outlet density'
- 'Step 2: Lower off-premises outlet density reduces structural availability and accessibility
  of alcohol for take-home consumption'
- 'Step 3: Reduced alcohol availability in the immediate residential environment decreases
  opportunities for adolescent girls to obtain alcohol'
- 'Step 4: Decreased alcohol access translates to reduced past 30-day drinking frequency
  and drinks per drinking day among girls'

    neighborhoods compared to controls in high density neighborhoods, indicating the

    was only observed for girls, not boys; MTO decreased girls' alcohol use but increased
    boys' alcohol use
