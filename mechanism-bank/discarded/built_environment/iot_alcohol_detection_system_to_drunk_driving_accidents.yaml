mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: IoT alcohol detection system with MQ3 sensor continuously monitors driver''s
  blood alcohol content before and during vehicle operation'
- 'Step 2: System mechanically disables vehicle starter when alcohol is detected above
  threshold, physically preventing intoxicated individuals from operating vehicles'
- 'Step 3: Real-time location and alcohol level data transmitted to cloud server enables
  remote monitoring and emergency response coordination'
- 'Step 4: Automated notification system alerts law enforcement and emergency services
  when impaired driving is detected, enabling rapid intervention'
- 'Step 5: Physical prevention of drunk driving and enhanced enforcement response
  reduces incidence of alcohol-related traffic accidents and fatalities'
