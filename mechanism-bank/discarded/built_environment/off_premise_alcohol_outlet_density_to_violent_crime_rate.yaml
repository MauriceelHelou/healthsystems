direction: positive
category: built_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher density of off-premise alcohol outlets (liquor stores, convenience
  stores) increases alcohol availability and accessibility for consumption elsewhere'
- 'Step 2: These outlets create gathering points and increased foot traffic in neighborhoods,
  including during evening hours'
- 'Step 3: Alcohol consumption in unregulated public spaces (streets, parks) occurs
  without supervision or security present in on-premise establishments'
- 'Step 4: Combination of public intoxication, lack of oversight, and concentrated
  activity creates conditions conducive to violent incidents'

  description: In formerly redlined communities, the association between off-premise
    alcohol outlet density and violent crime is 37% stronger (β = 42.4 vs 30.9), indicating
    that historical discriminatory policies amplify the impact of current alcohol
    outlet concentration
