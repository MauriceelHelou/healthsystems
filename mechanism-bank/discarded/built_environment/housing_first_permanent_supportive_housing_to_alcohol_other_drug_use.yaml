mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Permanent supportive housing provides stable housing environment for formerly
  homeless adults, removing structural barriers of housing insecurity'
- 'Step 2: Housing stability creates opportunity for structured case management and
  intervention delivery targeting social network composition'
- 'Step 3: Computer-assisted motivational interviewing intervention helps residents
  visualize and understand how their social networks influence AOD use patterns'
- 'Step 4: Visual network feedback combined with guided discussion prompts residents
  to consider changing their AOD use networks and behaviors'
- 'Step 5: Network restructuring and enhanced social support reduces exposure to AOD-using
  contexts and relationships'
