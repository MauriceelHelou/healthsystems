mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: LBD-7 license allows both on-site and off-site alcohol consumption at same
  location, combining risk profiles'
- 'Step 2: These dual-function outlets attract both dine-in customers and carry-out
  purchasers, increasing foot traffic and congregation'
- 'Step 3: Mixed functions create complex surveillance challenges with both contained
  and dispersed consumption patterns'
- 'Step 4: Dual licensing may indicate less specialized establishments with fewer
  resources for order maintenance than single-function venues'
