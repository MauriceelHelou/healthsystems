- 'Step 1: Vacant properties signal neighborhood disorder and structural neglect,
  reducing perceptions of social control'
- 'Step 2: Physical deterioration and abandonment reduce natural surveillance and
  eyes on the street'

  with reduced detection risk'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative environmental disorder weakens collective efficacy and community
  capacity to prevent violence'
