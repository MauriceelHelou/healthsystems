category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhoods with higher collective efficacy demonstrate stronger social
  cohesion and informal social control'
- 'Step 2: Community members in high collective efficacy neighborhoods actively monitor
  youth behavior and intervene in problem situations'
- 'Step 3: Social norms against underage drinking are more strongly reinforced through
  community monitoring and collective action'
- 'Step 4: Youth in these neighborhoods experience reduced access to alcohol and stronger
  protective messaging, delaying or preventing early onset use'
