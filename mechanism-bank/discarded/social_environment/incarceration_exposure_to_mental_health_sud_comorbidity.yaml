- 'Step 1: Criminal justice involvement concentrates individuals with complex, co-occurring
  mental health and substance use disorders'
- 'Step 2: Lack of integrated treatment for comorbid conditions in prison settings
  fails to address interconnected health needs'

  reintegration post-release'
- 'Step 4: Proportion of individuals with comorbid conditions entering prison increases
  over time as community treatment systems fail to serve this population'
