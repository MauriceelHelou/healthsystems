direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus-level drinking culture is established through institutional policies,
  social activities, marketing, and historical traditions'
- 'Step 2: This culture creates an environment where certain drinking behaviors become
  visible while others remain hidden, skewing students'' observational data'
- 'Step 3: Students form beliefs about normative drinking based on incomplete or biased
  information about actual campus-wide behavior'
- 'Step 4: Misperceptions are reinforced through selective exposure to heavy-drinking
  contexts and lack of information about non-drinking or moderate-drinking peers'
