mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Chinese enclaves in urban areas concentrate ethnic-specific businesses,
  religious institutions, and community organizations that provide cultural anchoring'
- 'Step 2: Dense immigrant networks in urban enclaves facilitate social monitoring
  and enforcement of traditional cultural norms regarding alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 3: Higher poverty and limited English fluency in enclaves may paradoxically
  reduce exposure to mainstream drinking cultures and alcohol marketing'
- 'Step 4: Urban enclave spatial arrangement creates walkable communities with daily
  face-to-face interactions that strengthen informal social control'
