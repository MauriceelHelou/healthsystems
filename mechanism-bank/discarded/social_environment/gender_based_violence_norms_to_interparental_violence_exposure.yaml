direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Patriarchal social structures and gender inequality create power imbalances
  between men and women in intimate relationships'
- 'Step 2: Cultural norms that normalize male dominance and female subordination reduce
  social sanctions against intimate partner violence'
- 'Step 3: Lack of legal enforcement, economic supports for leaving violent relationships,
  and community accountability enable perpetration to continue'
- 'Step 4: Children in these households are exposed to violence as normative pattern
  of intimate relationships'
