direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mainstream society constructs substance use disorders as a moral failing,
  attributing blame to individuals identified as ''addicts'''
- 'Step 2: This societal-level stigma creates structural barriers to care including
  discriminatory treatment policies, lack of insurance coverage, and limited treatment
  availability'
- 'Step 3: Stigmatizing perspectives shape how individuals with substance use problems
  are viewed and treated in healthcare settings, creating unwelcoming environments'
- 'Step 4: These structural and interpersonal barriers, combined with fear of stigmatization,
  reduce overall treatment-seeking rates despite high prevalence and significant health
  consequences'
