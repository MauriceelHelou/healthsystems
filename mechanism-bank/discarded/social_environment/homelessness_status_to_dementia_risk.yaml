mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates chronic exposure to environmental stressors, violence,
  and lack of safe shelter'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing limits access to preventive healthcare and management
  of chronic conditions'
- 'Step 3: Accumulated health conditions and untreated medical problems increase neurological
  vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Chronic stress from housing instability accelerates cognitive decline and
  neurodegeneration'
