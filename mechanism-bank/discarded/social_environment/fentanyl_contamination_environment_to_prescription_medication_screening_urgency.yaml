mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Fentanyl contamination has infiltrated illicit drug supplies including
  counterfeit prescription medications'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents engaging in prescription medication misuse face heightened
  overdose risk due to unpredictable fentanyl presence'
- 'Step 3: This environmental hazard increases the clinical importance of detecting
  prescription medication misuse behaviors early'
- 'Step 4: Refined screening questions that accurately identify prescription medication
  misuse become critical public health tools for preventing fentanyl-related adolescent
  overdose deaths'
