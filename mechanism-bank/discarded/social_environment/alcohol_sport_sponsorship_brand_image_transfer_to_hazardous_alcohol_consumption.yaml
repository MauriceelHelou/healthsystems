direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol brands invest in sport sponsorship to create associations between
  their products and positive sport imagery (athleticism, success, camaraderie, excitement)'
- 'Step 2: Through repeated exposure during sporting events, consumers unconsciously
  transfer positive attributes of the sport/team/athlete to the alcohol brand'
- 'Step 3: Brand image transfer creates positive affective responses and attitudes
  toward specific alcohol brands among sport consumers'
- 'Step 4: Enhanced positive brand attitudes increase purchase intentions and consumption
  of sponsored alcohol brands'
- 'Step 5: Increased consumption of alcohol brands contributes to overall hazardous
  alcohol consumption patterns'
