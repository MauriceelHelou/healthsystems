direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Individuals with substance use problems internalize mainstream societal
  views that label them as ''addicts'' who are blameworthy'
- 'Step 2: This internalized stigma generates fear of being stigmatized by others
  if their substance use is revealed'
- 'Step 3: Fear of stigma motivates individuals to consider seeking treatment as a
  way to address their substance use and potentially reduce stigmatizing situations'
- 'Step 4: This fear-driven motivation translates into increased intentions to seek
  help for substance use problems'
