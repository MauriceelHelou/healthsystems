mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Youth experiencing housing instability in small towns have limited options
  beyond family networks due to absence of formal services'
- 'Step 2: Current or prior addictions among youth or family members create safety
  risks within these family housing arrangements'
- 'Step 3: Safety concerns and substance-related conflicts compromise the reliability
  and stability of family supports'
- 'Step 4: Disruption of family supports leaves youth without viable housing alternatives
  in contexts lacking formal service infrastructure'
