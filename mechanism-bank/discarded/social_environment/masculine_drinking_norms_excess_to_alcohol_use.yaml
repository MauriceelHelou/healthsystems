  ideals that equate heavy drinking with masculinity and strength'
- 'Step 2: Male student-athletes are exposed to peer group expectations and team culture
  that reinforce excessive alcohol consumption as a marker of masculine identity'

  expectations for heavy drinking'
- 'Step 4: Athletes increase alcohol consumption to conform to masculine drinking
