direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Descriptive peer drinking norms create social environmental pressure and
  expectations around alcohol consumption'
- 'Step 2: These norms partially operate through enhancement drinking motives (mediation
  pathway)'
- 'Step 3: Norms also exert direct effects on binge drinking independent of enhancement
  motives through other mechanisms such as social conformity pressures'
- 'Step 4: Combined direct and indirect pathways result in increased binge drinking
  frequency'

- name: enhancement_drinking_motives
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Enhancement drinking motives serve as a partial mediator, meaning they
    explain part but not all of the relationship between peer drinking norms and binge
    drinking. Both direct and mediated pathways operate simultaneously.
- name: alcohol_resistance_self_efficacy
  direction: weakens
  strength: strong
  description: High alcohol resistance self-efficacy moderates (weakens) the direct
    effects of descriptive peer drinking norms on binge drinking, particularly for
    students with strong self-efficacy in resisting alcohol offers.
