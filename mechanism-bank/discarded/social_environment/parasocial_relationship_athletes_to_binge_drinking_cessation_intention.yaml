direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students develop parasocial relationships (one-sided emotional connections)
  with student-athletes as prominent campus figures'
- 'Step 2: Greater source involvement through parasocial relationships increases elaboration
  and deeper processing of health messages'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced message elaboration leads to more thoughtful consideration of
  the risks and consequences of binge drinking'
- 'Step 4: Thoughtful processing of health advocacy from trusted student-athlete sources
  fosters behavioral intentions to cease binge drinking'
