mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students observe and perceive how much peers drink in specific
  locations (home/dorm, bars, parties)'
- 'Step 2: These location-specific descriptive norms create social expectations about
  typical drinking behavior in each environment'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own drinking behavior to match perceived norms within
  that specific drinking location'
- 'Step 4: Higher perceived descriptive norms in a given location lead to increased
  alcohol consumption in that same location'
