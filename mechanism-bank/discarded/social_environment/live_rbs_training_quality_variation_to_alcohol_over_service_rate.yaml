direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Live RBS training varies in quality across different instructors and class
  sessions, creating inconsistent learning experiences'
- 'Step 2: Variable instruction quality leads to uneven understanding and application
  of alcohol service refusal protocols among servers'
- 'Step 3: Inconsistent protocol application results in lower and more variable rates
  of service refusal to intoxicated patrons'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of service continuation to intoxicated patrons increase alcohol
  over-service in establishments with lower quality training'
