mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social networks of formerly homeless individuals are shaped by structural
  conditions of homelessness, poverty, and limited resource access'
- 'Step 2: These constrained networks often include members with active AOD use patterns
  due to shared survival contexts and limited alternative social connections'
- 'Step 3: Network members influence AOD use through social norms, modeling behaviors,
  providing access to substances, and creating contexts where use is normalized'
- 'Step 4: Visual network feedback intervention makes these structural network influences
  visible and available for reflection and change'
- 'Step 5: Awareness of network influences enables residents to consider network restructuring
  to reduce AOD use'
