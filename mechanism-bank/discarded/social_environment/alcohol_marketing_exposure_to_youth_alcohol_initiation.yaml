  node_name: Youth Alcohol Initiation
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol marketing creates favorable brand associations and normalizes alcohol
  consumption through repeated exposure across multiple media platforms'
- 'Step 2: Youth develop positive attitudes and expectancies about alcohol use through
  exposure to marketing messages that portray drinking as desirable, socially rewarding,
  and associated with positive outcomes'
- 'Step 3: Marketing exposure increases youth susceptibility to alcohol use by creating
  social norms that portray drinking as common and acceptable behavior'
- 'Step 4: Increased susceptibility and positive attitudes translate into earlier
  initiation of alcohol consumption among previously non-drinking youth'

    influence and less able to critically evaluate marketing messages
