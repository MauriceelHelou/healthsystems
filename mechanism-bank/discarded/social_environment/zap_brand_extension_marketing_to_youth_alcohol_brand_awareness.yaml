direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Zero-alcohol products using established alcohol brand names and similar
  packaging expand marketing opportunities for alcohol companies in spaces where alcoholic
  products face restrictions'
- 'Step 2: Youth exposed to ZAP marketing develop familiarity with alcohol brands
  and positive brand associations even without consuming alcoholic products'
- 'Step 3: Brand awareness and positive associations created through ZAP marketing
  serve as gateway effects, priming youth for future alcohol consumption when they
  reach legal drinking age or earlier through underage drinking'
