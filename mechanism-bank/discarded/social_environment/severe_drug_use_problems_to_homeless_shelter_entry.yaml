direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Severe drug use problems often co-occur with structural disadvantages including
  poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to addiction treatment'
- 'Step 2: Criminalization of drug use and discriminatory policies create barriers
  to housing access and employment'
- 'Step 3: Inadequate community-based treatment and supportive housing options fail
  to prevent escalation of housing instability'
- 'Step 4: Structural lack of affordable housing combined with limited social safety
  nets increases vulnerability to homelessness among those with severe substance use'

    was attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for past shelter use,
    indicating housing history is a critical moderator reflecting structural housing
