mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students form attitudes about drinking and simultaneously perceive others''
  (peers and parents) attitudes'
- 'Step 2: Discrepancies emerge between self-attitudes and perceived attitudes of
  significant others'
- 'Step 3: These discrepancies create social-cognitive tension or misalignment in
  normative expectations'
- 'Step 4: Discrepancies are associated with patterns of alcohol consumption and related
  outcomes, with self-attitudes being the stronger predictor'
