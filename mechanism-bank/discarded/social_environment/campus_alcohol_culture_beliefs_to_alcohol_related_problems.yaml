mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus environments promote normative beliefs that alcohol is central and
  essential to college social experience'
- 'Step 2: Students internalize these beliefs about alcohol''s centrality to college
  life'
- 'Step 3: Stronger centrality beliefs reduce responsiveness to brief motivational
  interventions designed to reduce drinking'
- 'Step 4: Persistent drinking despite intervention exposure results in continued
  or smaller decreases in alcohol-related problems'
