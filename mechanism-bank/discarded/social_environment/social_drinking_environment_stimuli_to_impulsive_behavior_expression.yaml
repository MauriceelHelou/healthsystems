direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregaming events contain concentrated social and physical stimuli that
  are particularly appealing to individuals with impulsive traits'
- 'Step 2: These environmental cues activate reward-seeking and urgency-driven behavioral
  responses in susceptible individuals'
- 'Step 3: The interaction between person characteristics (impulsivity) and environmental
  features (pregaming stimuli) creates heightened risk states'
- 'Step 4: Environmental amplification of impulsive traits leads to increased drinking
  quantity and negative consequences'
