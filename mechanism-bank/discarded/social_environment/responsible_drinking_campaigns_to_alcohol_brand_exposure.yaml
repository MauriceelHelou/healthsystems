direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol companies conduct responsible drinking campaigns (RDCs) targeting
  commercial vehicle drivers to raise awareness about drink-driving consequences'
- 'Step 2: RDCs neither mention nor encourage abstinence as a prevention strategy,
  framing only moderate consumption as responsible'
- 'Step 3: Drink-driving campaigns serve as marketing opportunities through distribution
  of branded materials (T-shirts, banners, paraphernalia)'
- 'Step 4: Brand visibility increases through ostensibly health-promoting activities,
  expanding market reach while avoiding regulation of direct advertising'
