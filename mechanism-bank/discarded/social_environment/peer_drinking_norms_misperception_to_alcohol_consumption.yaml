mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students form inaccurate perceptions about the prevalence and intensity
  of drinking behaviors among their peers on campus'
- 'Step 2: These misperceptions lead students to overestimate the normative drinking
  behavior of their peer group'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own drinking behavior upward to align with what they
  perceive as the social norm'
- 'Step 4: Increased alcohol consumption results in academic, health, and safety consequences'
