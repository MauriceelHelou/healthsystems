direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Family history of alcohol problems creates a home environment with altered
  social modeling and potentially increased stress exposure'
- 'Step 2: Genetic predisposition and epigenetic factors interact with environmental
  exposures during critical neurodevelopmental windows'
- 'Step 3: These gene-environment interactions influence development of prefrontal
  cortex circuits involved in executive function and impulse control'
- 'Step 4: Altered neurodevelopment manifests as elevated delay discounting rates
  (greater preference for immediate rewards)'
