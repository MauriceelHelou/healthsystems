direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Acceptance of wife beating reflects internalization of patriarchal gender
  norms shaped by cultural institutions, religious teachings, and legal frameworks
  that historically sanctioned male authority'
- 'Step 2: Women who justify violence may have reduced capacity to recognize abuse,
  seek help, or access protective resources due to normalized expectations of male
  dominance'
- 'Step 3: Community-level acceptance of violence creates social environments with
  reduced informal sanctions against perpetrators and limited social support for survivors'
- 'Step 4: Structural factors including lack of economic independence, legal protections,
  and enforcement mechanisms compound vulnerability for women holding violence-justifying
  attitudes'

  description: Women who both witnessed parental violence (aOR=1.75) and justify wife
    beating may face compounded risk through overlapping pathways of normalized violence
    from childhood exposure and internalized acceptance of gender-based violence.

  description: The combination of violence-justifying attitudes and partner alcohol
    use (aOR=3.81) may create particularly high-risk contexts where structural risk
    factors and normative acceptance converge.
