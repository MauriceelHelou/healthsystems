  and temporal markers (weekends, holidays, sporting events)'
- 'Step 3: Repeated messaging establishes social norms that specific events require
  alcohol consumption for proper celebration or enjoyment'
- 'Step 4: Individuals adopt situation-specific drinking patterns as culturally expected
  behaviors, increasing frequency and volume of consumption'
