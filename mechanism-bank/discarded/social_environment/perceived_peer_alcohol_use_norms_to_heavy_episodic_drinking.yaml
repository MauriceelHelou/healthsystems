direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students form perceptions about peers'' engagement in heavy episodic
  drinking (binge drinking) and changes in this behavior during the pandemic'
- 'Step 2: Perceived norms around heavy episodic drinking establish expectations for
  high-risk drinking patterns within the college social environment'
- 'Step 3: Students model their own heavy episodic drinking behavior based on perceived
  peer norms, increasing binge drinking when they believe peers are doing so and decreasing
  when they perceive peers are reducing this behavior'
- 'Step 4: Strong correlation between perceived changes in peer heavy episodic drinking
  and individual heavy episodic drinking demonstrates normative influence on high-risk
  alcohol use patterns'
