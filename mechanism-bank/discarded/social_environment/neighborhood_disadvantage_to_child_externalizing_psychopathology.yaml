mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Neighborhood disadvantage creates multiple overlapping exposures including
  built environment deficits, toxicant exposures, and social conditions'
- 'Step 2: These neighborhood conditions shape the developmental context through limited
  resources, environmental hazards, and institutional availability'
- 'Step 3: Children in disadvantaged neighborhoods experience chronic stress, reduced
  opportunities for prosocial development, and increased exposure to risk factors'
- 'Step 4: Cumulative neighborhood disadvantage manifests as increased risk for externalizing
  psychopathology including conduct and oppositional defiance problems'
