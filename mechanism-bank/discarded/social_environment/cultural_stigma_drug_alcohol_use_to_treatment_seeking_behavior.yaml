direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Drug and alcohol use perceived as taboo topic within British South Asian
  and Muslim communities creates strong social stigma'
- 'Step 2: Fear of community judgment and stigmatization prevents individuals and
  families from acknowledging addiction problems'
- 'Step 3: Stigma creates barrier to discussing treatment options or seeking help
  from traditional drug and alcohol services'
- 'Step 4: Reduced treatment seeking behavior leads to lower engagement with recovery
  services despite need'
