mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Masculine drinking norms of excess promote heavy and frequent alcohol consumption
  among male student-athletes'
- 'Step 2: Increased alcohol use resulting from these norms leads to higher exposure
  to risky drinking situations'
- 'Step 3: Heavy drinking patterns increase the probability of experiencing negative
  outcomes including academic problems, injuries, legal issues, and relationship conflicts'
- 'Step 4: The normalization of excessive drinking within masculine culture reduces
  perceived risk and protective behaviors, further increasing consequences'
