mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Housing instability creates frequent residential disruptions and uncertainty
  about shelter'
- 'Step 2: Residential instability interrupts continuity of medical care and medication
  adherence'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress from housing uncertainty triggers sustained activation of
  stress response systems'
- 'Step 4: Prolonged stress exposure and medical care disruption increase risk of
  cognitive decline and dementia'
