direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Workplace AOD policies without accompanying support services create punitive
  rather than therapeutic approach to substance use'
- 'Step 2: Workers with substance use problems face barriers to disclosure and help-seeking
  due to fear of job loss or disciplinary action'
- 'Step 3: Lack of treatment resources prevents recovery and behavior change despite
  policy existence'
- 'Step 4: Policy alone fails to reduce substance use and may be less effective than
  having support services available'
