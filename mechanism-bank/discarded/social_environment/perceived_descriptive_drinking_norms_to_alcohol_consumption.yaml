direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students perceive how much their peer group (team) drinks on average'
- 'Step 2: These perceived group norms create social reference points for acceptable
  drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own drinking behavior to align with perceived group
  descriptive norms'
- 'Step 4: Teams approach consensus on drinking norms over time, reinforcing normative
  patterns'
- 'Step 5: Higher perceived descriptive norms lead to increased individual alcohol
  consumption'

- name: social_identification_with_team
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: At timepoints when students identified more strongly with their team
    (relative to person-mean levels), they more readily adhered to perceived descriptive
    team drinking norms
- name: indegree_centrality
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Students adhered more closely to perceived team drinking norms at timepoints
    when they had relatively lower indegree centrality (fewer peer nominations)
- name: network_density
  direction: 'null'
  strength: weak
  description: Network density did not moderate the association between perceived
    norms and drinking behavior
