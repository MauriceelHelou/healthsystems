  node_id: alcohol_consumption_frequency
  node_name: Alcohol Consumption Frequency
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Employment structures provide natural inhibitors to alcohol consumption
  through workplace policies, drug testing, professional conduct expectations, and
  scheduled obligations'
- 'Step 2: Retirement eliminates these institutional constraints and monitoring mechanisms'
- 'Step 3: Absence of work schedule removes temporal barriers to daytime drinking
  and eliminates need to manage next-day work performance'
- 'Step 4: Reduced social surveillance and accountability from workplace networks
  removes informal social controls on drinking behavior'
