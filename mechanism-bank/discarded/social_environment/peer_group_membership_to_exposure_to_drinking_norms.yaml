direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College institutional structures create organized peer groups through club
  sport teams'
- 'Step 2: Team membership establishes bounded social networks with regular interaction
  and shared activities'
- 'Step 3: Teams develop collective drinking norms that converge over time toward
  consensus'
- 'Step 4: Members are continuously exposed to team-specific drinking norms through
  social interactions'
- 'Step 5: This proximal exposure creates sustained influence on individual drinking
  behaviors'
