direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural trauma, stress, and lack of social support associated with homelessness
  contribute to higher rates of alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Resource scarcity in shelter and street contexts means insufficient access
  to individual drinking vessels'
- 'Step 3: Combination of alcohol consumption and lack of individual cups necessitates
  sharing beverages and cups among community members'
- 'Step 4: Social norms and mutual aid practices in homeless communities may normalize
  sharing as survival strategy'
