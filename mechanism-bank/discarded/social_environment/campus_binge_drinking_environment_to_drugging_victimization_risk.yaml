direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College campus environments with normalized binge drinking culture create
  frequent exposure to high-risk drinking contexts and settings where drugging can
  occur'
- 'Step 2: Higher frequency of binge drinking days increases temporal and spatial
  exposure to potential perpetrators and situations where drinks can be tampered with'
- 'Step 3: Intoxication from binge drinking reduces capacity for self-protection,
  monitoring of drinks, and recognition of warning signs'
- 'Step 4: Structural features of campus social life (parties, bars, Greek life) concentrate
  students in settings with both high drinking rates and drugging opportunity'
