- 'Step 1: Older sibling with SUD shares both genetic vulnerability and household
  environment with younger siblings'
- 'Step 2: Younger siblings may model substance use behaviors directly observed in
  older sibling during formative adolescent years'

  that normalize substance use'
- 'Step 4: Shared family stressors, parental SUD history, or other household adversities
  create common risk pathways for both siblings'
