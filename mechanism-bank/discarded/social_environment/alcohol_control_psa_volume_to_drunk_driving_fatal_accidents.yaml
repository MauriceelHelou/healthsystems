direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased volume of anti-drunk driving PSAs aired on television increases
  population exposure to alcohol-control messaging'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to PSAs during preceding 2-3 months increases awareness of drunk-driving
  risks and social consequences'
- 'Step 3: Enhanced awareness influences social norms around drunk-driving behavior
  and reduces acceptability of driving while intoxicated'
- 'Step 4: Population-level reduction in drunk-driving behavior leads to decreased
  rates of fatal accidents involving alcohol-impaired drivers'
