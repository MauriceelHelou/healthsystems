  node_name: Mutual Aid Recovery Group Availability
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Communities with high social deprivation experience elevated rates of substance
  use problems due to chronic stress, limited economic opportunities, and concentrated
  disadvantage'
- 'Step 2: Higher prevalence of substance use disorders creates greater local demand
  for peer-based recovery support services'
- 'Step 3: Mutual aid groups (e.g., AA, NA) organize in response to community need
  and locate in accessible spaces within affected communities'
- 'Step 4: Similar to formal treatment services, mutual aid groups benefit from affordable
  meeting spaces in socially deprived areas and face less stigma-based resistance'
- 'Step 5: The combination of higher need and lower barriers to establishment results
  in greater availability of mutual aid recovery groups in socially deprived communities'
