mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Historical and contemporary structural factors create racialized patterns
  of firearm ownership, with higher rates among White communities'
- 'Step 2: Socioeconomic segregation and differential exposure to gun culture shape
  attitudes and access to firearms by race/ethnicity'
- 'Step 3: State policies and enforcement practices around firearms reflect and reinforce
  racial disparities in ownership and access'
- 'Step 4: These structural patterns manifest in college students from different racial/ethnic
  backgrounds having vastly different rates of firearm access'
