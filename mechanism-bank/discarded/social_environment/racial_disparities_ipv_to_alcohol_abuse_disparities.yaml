mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates concentrated disadvantage and stress in African
  American communities'
- 'Step 2: African American women experience disproportionately high rates of intimate
  partner violence exposure compared to other groups'
- 'Step 3: Despite lower baseline alcohol use rates, disparate violence exposure creates
  heightened risk pathways to alcohol abuse'
- 'Step 4: Interaction of violence trauma with economic marginalization and reduced
  social support intensifies alcohol abuse risk'
- 'Step 5: Systemic barriers to treatment and culturally responsive services limit
  recovery pathways'
