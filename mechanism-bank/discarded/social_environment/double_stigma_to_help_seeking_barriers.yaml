mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Black adults with behavioral health disorders experience intersecting forms
  of stigma based on both race and mental health/addiction status'
- 'Step 2: Double stigma creates compounded discrimination, marginalization, and exclusion
  in healthcare systems and society'
- 'Step 3: The combined effect of racial and mental health stigma amplifies psychological
  burden beyond either stigma alone'
- 'Step 4: Multiple forms of stigma create layered barriers to treatment access including
  anticipated discrimination, reduced trust in healthcare systems, and internalized
  barriers'

  description: The relationship between double stigma and help-seeking barriers is
    partially mediated through the serial pathway of internalized self-stigma and
    depressive symptoms, indicating the mechanism operates through these intermediate
    psychological processes
