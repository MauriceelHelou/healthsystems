direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of educational access reflects structural inequality in educational
  systems and socioeconomic barriers to schooling'
- 'Step 2: Limited education restricts employment opportunities and earning potential,
  creating economic stress that increases household tensions'
- 'Step 3: Educational deprivation limits exposure to information about gender equality,
  conflict resolution, and the harms of violence'
- 'Step 4: Lower education correlates with reduced access to social networks and resources
  that promote non-violent norms'
- 'Step 5: Educational inequality reinforces patriarchal power structures that normalize
  male dominance and control over pregnant partners'
