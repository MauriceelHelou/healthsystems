direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Physical and emotional abuse during childhood disrupts healthy attachment
  formation and emotional regulation development'
- 'Step 2: Early trauma exposure alters stress response systems and normalizes violence
  as a conflict resolution strategy'
- 'Step 3: Lack of modeled healthy relationship behaviors and unresolved trauma manifest
  as increased likelihood of perpetrating multitype violence in adult intimate relationships'
- 'Step 4: Gendered socialization patterns interact with childhood abuse to create
  specific pathways for males toward IPV perpetration'
