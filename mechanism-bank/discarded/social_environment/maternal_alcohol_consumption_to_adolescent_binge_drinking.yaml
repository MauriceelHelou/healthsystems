mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Maternal alcohol consumption establishes normative patterns of drinking
  within the household environment'
- 'Step 2: Adolescents are exposed to alcohol use as modeled behavior, reducing perceived
  risks and increasing acceptance'
- 'Step 3: Household availability of alcohol may increase through maternal purchasing
  patterns'
- 'Step 4: Social learning and normalization processes lead to increased likelihood
  of adolescent binge drinking behavior'
