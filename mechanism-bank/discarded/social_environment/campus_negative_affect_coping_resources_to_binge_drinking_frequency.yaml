direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Campus environment lacks accessible programs teaching adaptive coping strategies
  for negative emotions'
- 'Step 2: Female college students with high negative urgency (tendency to act impulsively
  when distressed) lack institutional support for emotion regulation'
- 'Step 3: Students default to maladaptive coping mechanisms including alcohol consumption
  during negative emotional states'
- 'Step 4: Repeated use of alcohol as coping mechanism increases frequency of binge
  drinking episodes'

  description: Negative urgency (impulsive response to negative affect) is the strongest
    impulsivity predictor of binge drinking frequency; students with higher negative
    urgency would benefit most from adaptive coping programs
