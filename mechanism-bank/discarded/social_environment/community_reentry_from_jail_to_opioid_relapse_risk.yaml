mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Transition from jail to community exposes women to environmental triggers
  and social contexts associated with previous substance use'
- 'Step 2: Women face unique gender-specific risk factors during re-entry including
  trauma, economic instability, housing insecurity, and caregiving responsibilities'
- 'Step 3: Loss of treatment continuity during transition period leaves women without
  medications or support during high-risk re-entry phase'
- 'Step 4: Combination of environmental stressors, structural barriers, and treatment
  discontinuity increases vulnerability to opioid relapse'
