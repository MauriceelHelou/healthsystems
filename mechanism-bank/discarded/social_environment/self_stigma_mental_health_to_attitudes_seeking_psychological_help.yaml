  node_name: Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help
direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Internalized stigma creates negative self-perceptions about seeking help
  (e.g., viewing help-seeking as a sign of weakness or personal failure)'
- 'Step 2: These negative self-perceptions generate psychological barriers including
  shame, embarrassment, and fear of social judgment'
- 'Step 3: Psychological barriers reduce willingness to engage with mental health
  services and create more negative attitudes toward help-seeking'
- 'Step 4: Negative attitudes toward help-seeking prevent individuals from accessing
  professional psychological support when needed'
