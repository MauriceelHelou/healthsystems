  node_id: aud_registration
  node_name: Alcohol Use Disorder Registration
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher prevalence of AUD among peers in the neighborhood creates normalization
  of alcohol misuse patterns'
- 'Step 2: Social modeling and peer influence shape individual drinking behaviors
  through daily interactions and social network effects'
- 'Step 3: Increased exposure to alcohol-related behaviors and reduced collective
  efficacy against substance use increases individual risk'
- 'Step 4: Environmental factors combine with social networks to increase likelihood
  of AUD development requiring registration'
