mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Gambling products are designed with structural characteristics (e.g., rapid
  event frequency, near-miss events, availability of credit) that increase addictive
  potential'
- 'Step 2: These structural features are often unintuitive and invisible to laypeople,
  creating information asymmetry'
- 'Step 3: Without awareness of these characteristics, laypeople cannot accurately
  assess addiction risk of different gambling products'
- 'Step 4: Inability to identify high-risk products increases exposure to more addictive
  gambling forms'
- 'Step 5: Greater exposure to structurally addictive gambling products increases
  development of gambling disorder'

  description: Exposure to pictograms and their definitions doubled the ability of
    laypeople to assess addictiveness (ICC = 0.28) compared with slogan group (ICC
    = 0.14) or control group (ICC = 0.14), representing 100% improvement in risk identification
