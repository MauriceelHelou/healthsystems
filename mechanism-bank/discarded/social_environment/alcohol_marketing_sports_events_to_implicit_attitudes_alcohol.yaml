  node_id: implicit_attitudes_alcohol
  node_name: Implicit (Non-Conscious) Attitudes Toward Alcohol
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Incidental exposure to alcohol brand imagery occurs during sports event
  viewing, embedding commercial messages within entertainment content'
- 'Step 2: Automatic, non-conscious processing of alcohol cues occurs without requiring
  deliberative cognitive effort or awareness'
- 'Step 3: Repeated pairing of positive sporting context with alcohol brands creates
  automatic positive evaluations through associative learning'
- 'Step 4: These implicit attitudes operate outside conscious awareness and influence
  behavioral tendencies toward alcohol consumption'

moderators:
- name: cognitive_depletion
  direction: no_effect
  strength: weak
  description: Cognitive fatigue (depletion task) did not moderate the effect on indirect
    measures, suggesting the mechanism operates through automatic non-conscious processes
    rather than effortful conscious processing
- name: brand_prototypicality
  direction: strengthens
  strength: moderate
  description: Prototypical alcohol brands (strongly associated with alcohol category)
    versus non-prototypical brands were tested, suggesting brand-alcohol association
    strength may moderate effects
