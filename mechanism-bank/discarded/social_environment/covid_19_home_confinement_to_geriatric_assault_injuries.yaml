direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pandemic lockdowns and curfews confine older adults to home environments
  with potential abusers for extended periods'
- 'Step 2: Social isolation eliminates protective monitoring by external family, friends,
  and community members'
- 'Step 3: Economic stressors and pandemic-related tensions increase household conflict
  and violence'
- 'Step 4: Trapped in unsafe domestic situations with limited escape options, older
  adults experience increased assault-related trauma requiring emergency care'
