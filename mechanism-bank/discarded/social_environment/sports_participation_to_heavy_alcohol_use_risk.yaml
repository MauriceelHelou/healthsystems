direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Collegiate athletic programs create concentrated peer environments with
  strong social bonds and team identity'
- 'Step 2: Athletic culture normalizes celebratory drinking after games, alcohol use
  as bonding activity, and heavy drinking as part of team culture'
- 'Step 3: Athletes face unique stressors including performance pressure, injuries,
  and time demands that may increase alcohol use as coping mechanism'
- 'Step 4: Alcohol marketing and sponsorship of sports events creates environmental
  exposure and normalization of drinking within sports contexts'
- 'Step 5: Male athletes particularly experience pressure to conform to masculine
  drinking norms embedded in athletic culture'
