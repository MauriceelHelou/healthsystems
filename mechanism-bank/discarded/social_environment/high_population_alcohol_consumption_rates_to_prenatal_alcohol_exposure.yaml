direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Countries with very high alcohol consumption rates normalize drinking behavior
  across populations, including women of reproductive age'
- 'Step 2: Cultural acceptance and availability of alcohol increases probability of
  consumption during pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Lack of public health infrastructure and education about prenatal alcohol
  risks fails to prevent maternal drinking'
- 'Step 4: Higher rates of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy result in
  increased fetal exposure'
