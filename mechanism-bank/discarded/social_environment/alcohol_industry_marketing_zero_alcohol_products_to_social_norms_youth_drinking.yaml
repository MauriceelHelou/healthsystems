direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol companies market zero-alcohol beverages for consumption in new
  locations (e.g., workplace) and to previously non-drinking groups (e.g., pregnant
  women, implicitly youth)'
- 'Step 2: Marketing strategies normalize alcohol brand presence and alcohol-mimicking
  consumption patterns in contexts previously free from alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Expanded visibility of alcohol brands and drinking-like behaviors in diverse
  social settings shifts community norms about acceptability of alcohol-related products'
- 'Step 4: Normalized presence of alcohol brands and consumption patterns among non-drinking
  populations reduces perceived barriers and risks associated with youth alcohol initiation'
