mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students perceive their peers'' attitudes toward alcohol consumption and
  observe peer drinking behaviors in their social environment'
- 'Step 2: These normative perceptions shape individual expectations about acceptable
  drinking behaviors and create social pressure to conform'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own drinking patterns to align with perceived peer
  norms, increasing binge drinking frequency to match or fit in with peer behaviors'
- 'Step 4: Reinforcement through social acceptance and integration strengthens continued
  engagement in binge drinking behaviors'
