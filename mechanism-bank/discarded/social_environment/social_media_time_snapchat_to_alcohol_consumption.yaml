direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Extended exposure to Snapchat content during the critical transition period
  into college increases visibility of peer alcohol-related activities and social
  events'
- 'Step 2: Visual and ephemeral nature of Snapchat content creates heightened perceptions
  of peer drinking frequency and quantity (perceived drinking norms)'
- 'Step 3: Inflated perceptions of same-sex peer drinking norms alter individual expectations
  about typical student drinking behavior'
- 'Step 4: Increased perceived norms lead to greater alcohol consumption to conform
  to what is believed to be normative behavior among peers'
