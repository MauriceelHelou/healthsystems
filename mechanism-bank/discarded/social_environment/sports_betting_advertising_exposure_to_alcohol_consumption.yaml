mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sports betting advertisements systematically integrate alcohol imagery
  and messaging into sports viewing contexts'
- 'Step 2: Advertisements associate emotionally charged sporting situations (watching
  live games, celebrating goals) with alcohol consumption'

  as part of sports betting culture'
- 'Step 4: The normalization of alcohol-gambling associations increases likelihood
  of alcohol consumption in sports viewing and betting contexts'
