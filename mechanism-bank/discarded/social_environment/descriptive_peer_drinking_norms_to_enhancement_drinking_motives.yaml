mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students observe higher levels of drinking among peers and perceive these
  behaviors as normative social activities'
- 'Step 2: Peer drinking contexts create social environments where alcohol is associated
  with fun, excitement, and positive social experiences'
- 'Step 3: Students internalize these associations and develop enhancement-oriented
  motivations for drinking (e.g., to have fun, to get excited)'
- 'Step 4: Enhancement motives become established as primary drivers for alcohol consumption'
