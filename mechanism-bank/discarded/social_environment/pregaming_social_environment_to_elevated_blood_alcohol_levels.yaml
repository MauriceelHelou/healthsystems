direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregaming as a social practice creates contexts where students consume
  alcohol rapidly before attending events or parties'
- 'Step 2: The social environment normalizes high-intensity drinking patterns during
  pregaming episodes'
- 'Step 3: Rapid alcohol consumption in pregaming contexts leads to elevated blood
  alcohol concentrations before the main event begins'
