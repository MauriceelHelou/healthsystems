direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Traumatic experiences increase psychological distress and maladaptive coping
  patterns'
- 'Step 2: Trauma drives self-medication behaviors through alcohol use as described
  in the indirect pathway'
- 'Step 3: Increased alcohol use severity results in higher frequency and intensity
  of drinking episodes'
- 'Step 4: Higher alcohol consumption patterns lead to elevated blood alcohol concentrations
  when attempting to operate vehicle with interlock device'
- 'Step 5: More frequent high BAC attempts result in higher lockout ratios on the
  interlock system'
