direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Emergency Warming Centre accepts guests under the influence of alcohol
  or drugs, removing sobriety barriers to shelter access'
- 'Step 2: Reduced barriers enable consistent access to food and safe accommodation
  for vulnerable populations'
- 'Step 3: Meeting basic survival needs (food, warmth, safety) reduces physiological
  stress and improves physical well-being'
- 'Step 4: Guests report feeling better about their overall health due to improved
  living conditions and reduced survival threats'
