direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Witnessing domestic violence during early childhood provides direct modeling
  of violence as a relationship pattern and power dynamic'
- 'Step 2: Exposure to parental IPV creates chronic stress and insecurity, disrupting
  children''s development of healthy relationship schemas'
- 'Step 3: Boys observing male caregivers perpetrating violence may internalize these
  behaviors as acceptable masculine responses to conflict'
- 'Step 4: Lack of intervention and supportive services allows violent relationship
  patterns to become normalized and reproduced in adulthood'
