to_node:
  node_id: binge_drinking_prevalence
  node_name: Binge Drinking Prevalence
direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Mass media campaign with social norming messages is deployed across campus
  environment through posters and educational materials'
- 'Step 2: Students are exposed to accurate information about peer drinking norms,
  correcting misperceptions about prevalence of binge drinking'
- 'Step 3: Changed perception of social norms reduces perceived peer pressure and
  social acceptability of excessive drinking'
- 'Step 4: Campus drinking culture shifts as students align behavior with actual (lower)
  norms rather than inflated perceptions'
- 'Step 5: Overall binge drinking prevalence decreases across student population'
