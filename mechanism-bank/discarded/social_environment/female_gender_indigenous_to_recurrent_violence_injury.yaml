direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Indigenous females face intersecting structural oppressions including colonial
  violence, systemic racism, and patriarchal gender-based violence'
- 'Step 2: These intersecting forces concentrate Indigenous females in situations
  of economic dependency, social isolation, and limited access to protective services'
- 'Step 3: Both female gender and Indigenous ethnicity are independent risk factors
  for prior interpersonal violence presentations, with Indigenous females dramatically
  over-represented (35.4% vs 5.0%)'
- 'Step 4: Evidence of alcohol intake compounds vulnerability, with these factors
  clustering to create recurring cycles of violence and re-injury'
