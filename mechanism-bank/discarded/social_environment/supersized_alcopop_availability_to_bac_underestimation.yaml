category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Supersized alcopops contain large quantities of alcohol in single-serving
  containers that resemble non-alcoholic beverages in volume'
- 'Step 2: Young adults use visual cues from container size to estimate alcohol content,
  similar to how they would estimate beer consumption'
- 'Step 3: Lack of clear product labeling obscures the actual number of standard drinks
  contained in supersized alcopop cans'
- 'Step 4: Students significantly underestimate their BAC from consuming supersized
  alcopops compared to equivalent volumes of beer'
