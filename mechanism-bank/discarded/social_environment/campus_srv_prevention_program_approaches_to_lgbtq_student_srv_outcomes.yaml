mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Professionals identified four distinct approaches to including or excluding
  LGBTQ+ students in campus SRV prevention programs'
- 'Step 2: More inclusive approaches integrate LGBTQ+-affirming content at individual,
  relationship, community, and policy levels of the social ecological model'
- 'Step 3: LGBTQ+-affirming programming increases student awareness of SRV dynamics
  in same-sex and gender-diverse relationships'
- 'Step 4: Inclusive approaches reduce stigma and increase institutional trust, facilitating
  earlier intervention and help-seeking'
- 'Step 5: Comprehensive LGBTQ+-affirming prevention reduces SRV incidence and improves
  outcomes for affected students'
