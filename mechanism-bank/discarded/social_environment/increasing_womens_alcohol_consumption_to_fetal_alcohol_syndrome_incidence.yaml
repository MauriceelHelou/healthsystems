mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Societal trends show increasing alcohol consumption rates among women of
  childbearing age'
- 'Step 2: Higher baseline alcohol consumption in this population increases likelihood
  of drinking during pregnancy'
- 'Step 3: Increased prenatal alcohol exposure rates lead to more cases of fetal alcohol
  teratogenesis'
- 'Step 4: Rising FAS incidence increases medical expenses and societal burden'
