- 'Step 1: Public health messaging and education gaps result in limited awareness
  about what constitutes problem alcohol use'
- 'Step 2: Individuals fail to recognize their drinking levels as problematic due
  to normalized drinking cultures'

  to seeking help'
- 'Step 4: Delayed treatment-seeking allows progression to severe alcohol use disorders
  before first treatment contact'
