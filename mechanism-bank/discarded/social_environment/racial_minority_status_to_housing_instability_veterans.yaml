direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Structural racism creates differential access to housing markets, employment
  opportunities, and wealth accumulation for racial minority veterans'
- 'Step 2: Historical discrimination in housing (redlining, restrictive covenants)
  and lending practices limits homeownership and stable rental options'
- 'Step 3: Lower economic resources and limited social safety nets increase vulnerability
  to housing loss and eviction'
- 'Step 4: Racial discrimination in rental markets and employment reduces ability
  to secure and maintain stable housing'
