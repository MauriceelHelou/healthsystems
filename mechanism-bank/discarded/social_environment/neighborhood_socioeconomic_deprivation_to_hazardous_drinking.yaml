direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods experience concentrated disinvestment,
  reduced public services, and limited economic opportunities'
- 'Step 2: These structural conditions create chronic psychosocial stress, social
  isolation, and reduced access to health-promoting resources and social support networks'
- 'Step 3: Limited community resources and protective social structures reduce collective
  efficacy and informal social controls around alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: The combination of chronic stress exposure and reduced protective factors
  increases risk of hazardous drinking patterns as a coping mechanism'
- 'Step 5: These neighborhood-level effects operate independently of individual genetic
  predisposition and family background, as demonstrated by within-twin-pair associations'
