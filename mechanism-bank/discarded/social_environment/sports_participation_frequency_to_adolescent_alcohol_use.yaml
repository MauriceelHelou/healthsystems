direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Higher sports participation frequency among postmillennial adolescents
  provides structured leisure time and alternative social contexts'
- 'Step 2: Structured sports activities compete with unstructured leisure time traditionally
  associated with alcohol experimentation'
- 'Step 3: Despite initial lower alcohol use, adolescents with highest sports frequency
  show steeper increases over time, potentially due to evolving social norms in sports
  contexts'

  description: Adolescents with highest initial sports frequency showed slightly lower
    initial alcohol use (b=-0.06, p=.351) but steeper increases over time with quadratic
    curvature (b=0.09, p=.004), suggesting complex temporal dynamics
- name: time_varying_confounders
  direction: weakens
  strength: weak
  description: After adjusting for time-varying confounders (parental cohabitation,
    unstructured leisure time, sensation-seeking, behavioral problems), the association
    between change in sports practice and change in alcohol use became weak or non-significant
    (b=-0.03, p=.065)
