direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Experiencing drugging victimization in the campus environment creates awareness
  of personal vulnerability and risks associated with substance use contexts'
- 'Step 2: Victimization experience triggers behavioral adaptation as students modify
  their risk-taking behaviors to avoid repeat victimization (''once bitten, twice
  shy'' response)'
- 'Step 3: Students who were drugged at Time 1 but not Time 2 reduced their binge
  drinking frequency compared to those never victimized or repeatedly victimized'
- 'Step 4: Reduced exposure to high-risk drinking environments and contexts decreases
  subsequent drugging victimization risk'

- name: timing_of_victimization
  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: The protective effect of reduced binge drinking only emerged among
    those drugged at Time 1 only (not Time 2), demonstrating that timing and pattern
    of victimization matters for behavioral adaptation
- name: repeat_victimization_status
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Those experiencing drugging at both Time 1 and Time 2 increased binge
    drinking similar to never-victimized students, suggesting repeat victimization
    may undermine protective behavioral changes
