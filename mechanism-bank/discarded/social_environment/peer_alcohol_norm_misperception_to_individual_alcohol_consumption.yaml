direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students systematically overestimate how much alcohol their peers consume
  due to limited or biased information about actual peer behavior'
- 'Step 2: This misperception creates a perceived social norm that heavy drinking
  is more common and acceptable than it actually is'
- 'Step 3: Students adjust their own drinking behavior upward to conform to this perceived
  (but inaccurate) peer norm'
- 'Step 4: The social environment thus produces elevated alcohol consumption through
  normative social influence based on misperceived behavioral standards'
