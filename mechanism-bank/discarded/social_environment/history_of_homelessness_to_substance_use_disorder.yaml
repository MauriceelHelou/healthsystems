mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates exposure to high-risk environments where substances
  are more readily available'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing eliminates protective factors such as routine, security,
  and social accountability'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress and untreated mental health conditions associated with homelessness
  increase vulnerability to substance use'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to addiction treatment services during homelessness allows
  progression from use to disorder'
