  node_name: Normalization of Alcohol Culture in University Sports
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Alcohol companies provide branded promotional materials (t-shirts, beer
  freezers, stereo systems) and event promoters to university sports clubs, embedding
  alcohol branding into sports infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Sports events and parties feature prominent alcohol branding and industry
  representatives actively marketing products, creating repeated exposure to pro-alcohol
  messaging in social settings'
- 'Step 3: Association between sports participation/attendance and alcohol consumption
  becomes normalized through repeated pairing of athletic activities with sponsored
  drinking events'
- 'Step 4: Students internalize alcohol consumption as an expected and normal part
  of university sports culture, reducing perceived risks and increasing social pressure
  to participate in drinking'
