mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Hispanic patients experience less favorable treatment outcomes for locally
  advanced rectal cancer compared to non-Hispanic White patients'
- 'Step 2: These disparities are partially explained by social determinants of health
  including access to care, insurance status, language barriers, and socioeconomic
  factors'
- 'Step 3: Additional demographic, clinical, and pathologic factors contribute to
  differential treatment response and surgical outcomes'
- 'Step 4: The combination of structural barriers and clinical factors results in
  poorer overall treatment outcomes for Hispanic patients with LARC'
