direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pregaming events concentrate alcohol consumption in compressed timeframes
  before main events'
- 'Step 2: This pattern leads to rapid blood alcohol elevation and impaired judgment
  before individuals enter subsequent social settings'
- 'Step 3: The combination of intoxication from pregaming plus continued drinking
  at main events increases risk exposure'
- 'Step 4: Elevated intoxication levels result in increased negative consequences
  including safety risks, social problems, and health harms'

  strength: moderate
  description: Individuals higher in positive urgency (tendency to act rashly when
    experiencing positive emotions) experienced more consequences on pregaming days,
    suggesting enhanced vulnerability in emotionally charged pregaming contexts
- name: sensation_seeking
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Individuals higher in sensation seeking experienced fewer consequences
    on pregaming days, possibly due to greater tolerance or experience with high-risk
    drinking contexts
