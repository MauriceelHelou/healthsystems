mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness results in increased exposure to violence-prone environments
  without the protection of stable, secure housing'
- 'Step 2: Lack of secure housing limits ability to avoid dangerous situations, retreat
  to safety, or implement protective strategies'
- 'Step 3: Unhoused individuals have reduced access to support systems and resources
  for conflict resolution and violence prevention'
- 'Step 4: Structural vulnerability compounds with lack of safe spaces, increasing
  likelihood of repeated violent encounters'
