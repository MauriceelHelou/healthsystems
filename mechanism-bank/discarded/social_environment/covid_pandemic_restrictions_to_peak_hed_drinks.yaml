direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pandemic restrictions limit group size and social gathering intensity'
- 'Step 2: Smaller social groups reduce social drinking pressure and competitive drinking
  behaviors'
- 'Step 3: Limited access to large parties and events constrains the availability
  of alcohol in single settings'
- 'Step 4: Students consume fewer drinks during heavy episodic drinking episodes despite
  similar frequency'
