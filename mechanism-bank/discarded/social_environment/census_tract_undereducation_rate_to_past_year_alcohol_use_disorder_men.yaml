direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: High undereducation neighborhoods may have stronger traditional family
  structures and social networks that discourage heavy drinking among men'
- 'Step 2: Lower educational attainment areas may have limited access to venues and
  social settings where problematic drinking occurs'
- 'Step 3: Cultural norms in lower-education neighborhoods may enforce protective
  behavioral expectations for men'
- 'Step 4: Reduced risk of past-year alcohol use disorder among men in high undereducation
  areas'
