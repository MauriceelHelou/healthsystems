direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates multiple competing survival priorities (shelter, food,
  safety) that supersede health concerns'
- 'Step 2: Limited economic resources and lack of stable housing reduce capacity to
  adapt to policy-driven price changes'
- 'Step 3: Chronic stress and trauma associated with homelessness affect decision-making
  and policy responsiveness'
- 'Step 4: Wide variation in personal, relational, and social contexts among people
  experiencing homelessness leads to diverse responses to same policy intervention'
