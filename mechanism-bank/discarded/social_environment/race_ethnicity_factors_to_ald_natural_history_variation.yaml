mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Race and ethnicity serve as proxies for differential exposure to structural
  determinants including neighborhood disadvantage, occupational hazards, environmental
  toxins, and chronic stressors'
- 'Step 2: These differential exposures interact with alcohol consumption patterns
  to influence liver disease initiation and progression through both direct biological
  pathways and indirect pathways affecting healthcare engagement'
- 'Step 3: Cumulative exposure to multiple structural disadvantages across the life
  course creates divergent disease trajectories among racial/ethnic groups'
- 'Step 4: Differences in disease trajectories manifest as disparities in progression
  rates, complication development, and mortality across the continuum of ALD stages'
