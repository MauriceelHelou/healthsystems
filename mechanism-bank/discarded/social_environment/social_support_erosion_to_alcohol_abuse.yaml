direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Loss of social support networks removes protective relationships and emotional
  resources'
- 'Step 2: Isolation reduces access to alternative coping strategies and community
  resources'
- 'Step 3: Absence of supportive relationships increases psychological distress and
  vulnerability'
- 'Step 4: Without social buffers, individuals turn to readily available substances
  like alcohol for coping'
- 'Step 5: Continued use in isolation develops into abuse patterns without social
  accountability or intervention'
