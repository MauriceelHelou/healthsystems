direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Increased refusal of alcohol service to apparently intoxicated patrons
  reduces further alcohol consumption among already intoxicated individuals'
- 'Step 2: Reduced alcohol consumption prevents escalation of blood alcohol concentration
  beyond legal driving limits'
- 'Step 3: Lower blood alcohol concentrations reduce impairment severity and likelihood
  of choosing to drive'
- 'Step 4: Decreased prevalence of intoxicated individuals attempting to drive reduces
  overall drunk driving incidents'
