- 'Step 1: Social contexts and cultures outside treatment settings provide diverse
  identity options and narrative frameworks for understanding life changes'
- 'Step 2: These contexts shape how individuals interpret and make sense of their
  experiences with alcohol problems and recovery'
- 'Step 3: Access to varied social environments enables individuals to adopt identities
  and narratives (emancipation, discovery, mastery, coping) that support change'
- 'Step 4: The availability of multiple narrative frameworks and social supports outside
  formal systems facilitates natural recovery processes'
