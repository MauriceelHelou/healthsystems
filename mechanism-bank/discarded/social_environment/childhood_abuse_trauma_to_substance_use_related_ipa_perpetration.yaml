direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Childhood abuse and trauma exposure creates predisposing background factors
  that shape developmental trajectories'
- 'Step 2: Early trauma leads to heterogeneous pathways including rule-breaking behaviors,
  entrenched substance use patterns, or relationship insecurity'
- 'Step 3: These distinct pathways interact with substance use behaviors (intoxication,
  withdrawal, acquisition patterns, lifestyle)'
- 'Step 4: The combination of early trauma-based vulnerabilities and substance use
  increases both frequency and severity of intimate partner abuse perpetration'
