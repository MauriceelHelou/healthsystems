direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Radio broadcasts deliver alcohol advertising to adolescent audiences through
  music programming and other youth-oriented content without adequate age restrictions'
- 'Step 2: Among youth who have initiated drinking, radio advertising provides repeated
  audio messaging that reinforces drinking behaviors during routine activities'
- 'Step 3: Radio''s intimate and personal nature creates strong brand associations
  and normalizes alcohol consumption in everyday contexts'
- 'Step 4: Continued exposure through radio channels escalates drinking from experimentation
  to occasional regular use among vulnerable youth populations'

  description: Radio advertising shows the strongest effect among youth who have already
    initiated drinking in childhood, with more than 2.5-fold increased odds of occasional
    drinking. This channel specifically affects drinking escalation rather than initiation.
