direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lack of stable housing creates exposure to unsafe drug use environments
  without access to sterile equipment or overdose prevention resources'
- 'Step 2: Homelessness reduces access to healthcare services, drug treatment programs,
  and harm reduction initiatives'
- 'Step 3: Unstable living conditions increase social isolation and reduce likelihood
  of supervision during drug use, preventing timely overdose intervention'
- 'Step 4: These structural barriers collectively increase risk of fatal poisoning
  from opioids and polydrug use'
