- 'Step 1: The Americas region shows high alcohol per capita consumption patterns'
- 'Step 2: Elevated consumption leads to increased prevalence of alcohol use disorder
  and excessive drinking'

  increase in prevalence'
- 'Step 4: Region experiences second highest deaths (5.5%) and DALYs (6.7%) attributable
  to alcohol consumption globally'
