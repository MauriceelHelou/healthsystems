direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students observe peers engaging in excessive drinking behaviors at college
  social events'
- 'Step 2: Repeated observation of excessive drinking establishes descriptive norms
  about typical drinking behavior'
- 'Step 3: Descriptive norms inform injunctive norms about what behaviors are socially
  acceptable and expected'
- 'Step 4: Heavy drinking becomes normalized and embedded as the standard social practice
  within the college environment'
