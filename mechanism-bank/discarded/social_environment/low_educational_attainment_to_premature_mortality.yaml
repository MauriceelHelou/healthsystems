direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Low schooling levels concentrate in economically disadvantaged suburban
  districts with limited educational infrastructure'
- 'Step 2: Reduced educational attainment limits employment opportunities and income
  potential, perpetuating economic insecurity'
- 'Step 3: Lower health literacy associated with less education reduces understanding
  of disease prevention and navigation of healthcare systems'
- 'Step 4: These factors combine to increase risk of premature death and years of
  potential life lost'
