direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: College students perceive what level of drinking their peer group (team)
  approves of or endorses'
- 'Step 2: These perceived injunctive norms (approval-based expectations) create social
  pressure and define socially acceptable behavior'
- 'Step 3: Students conform to perceived group injunctive norms to gain social acceptance
  and avoid sanctions'
- 'Step 4: Higher perceived injunctive norms lead to increased individual alcohol
  consumption to meet group approval standards'

  direction: strengthens
  strength: strong
  description: At timepoints when students identified more strongly with their team
    (relative to person-mean levels), they more readily adhered to perceived injunctive
    team drinking norms
- name: indegree_centrality
  direction: weakens
  strength: moderate
  description: Students adhered more closely to perceived team drinking norms at timepoints
    when they had relatively lower indegree centrality (fewer peer nominations)
- name: team_sex_composition
  direction: 'null'
  strength: weak
  description: Team sex composition did not moderate the association between perceived
    norms and drinking behavior
