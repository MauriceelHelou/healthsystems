category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Lower educational attainment is associated with reduced access to quality
  prenatal care settings and providers'
- 'Step 2: Healthcare providers may exhibit implicit bias, providing less comprehensive
  preventive services to patients with lower socioeconomic indicators'
- 'Step 3: Pregnant persons with lower education may face structural barriers (transportation,
  work schedules, insurance coverage) limiting healthcare visits where screening occurs'
- 'Step 4: Lower rates of alcohol screening among less educated pregnant persons reduce
  opportunities for early intervention'
