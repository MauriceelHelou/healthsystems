direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Young adults often overestimate peer drinking norms, contributing to social
  pressure and normalization of heavy drinking in college and young adult environments'
- 'Step 2: Theory-based personalized feedback intervention provides corrective information
  about actual peer drinking patterns compared to perceived norms'
- 'Step 3: Normative feedback delivered via smartphone during morning evaluation periods
  creates opportunities for reflection on discrepancies between personal drinking
  and actual peer behavior'
- 'Step 4: Correction of misperceived peer norms reduces social pressure and perceived
  acceptability of heavy drinking, leading to reduced alcohol consumption'
