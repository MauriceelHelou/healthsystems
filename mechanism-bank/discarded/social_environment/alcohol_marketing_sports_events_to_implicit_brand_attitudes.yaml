  node_name: Implicit Attitudes Toward Specific Alcohol Brands
direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Sports events provide high-engagement context with emotional investment
  and positive affect toward teams and competition'
- 'Step 2: Alcohol brand placement during these emotionally charged moments creates
  automatic associations between brand and positive sporting experiences'
- 'Step 3: Incidental exposure (not requiring focused attention) to brand logos and
  imagery activates implicit memory traces'
- 'Step 4: Positive affect transfer occurs from the sports context to the brand through
  evaluative conditioning, strengthening brand preferences outside conscious awareness'
