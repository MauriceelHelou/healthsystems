- 'Step 1: Campus social environments that facilitate binge drinking create contexts
  where multiple substance use behaviors cluster'
- 'Step 2: Social situations involving alcohol use increase likelihood of concurrent

- 'Step 3: Binge drinking environments normalize risk-taking behaviors including tobacco
  use'
- 'Step 4: Students participating in binge drinking show higher rates of smoking behavior'
