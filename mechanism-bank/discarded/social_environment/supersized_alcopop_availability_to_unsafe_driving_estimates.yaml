direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Supersized alcopops lead to BAC underestimation due to product packaging
  and lack of clear labeling'
- 'Step 2: Students using supersized alcopops as reference estimate they can consume
  more beverages before reaching unsafe driving levels'
- 'Step 3: Students estimate consumption amounts that would generate BAC ≥0.08 g/dl
  while believing they remain below legal driving limits'
- 'Step 4: Increased odds of estimating unsafe consumption levels translates to potential
  increased impaired driving behavior'
