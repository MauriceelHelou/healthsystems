mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Home/dorm settings provide private, unsupervised spaces with minimal external
  monitoring or intervention from authorities'
- 'Step 2: These residential environments normalize consequence experiences through
  peer proximity and shared living spaces'
- 'Step 3: Students perceive elevated descriptive and injunctive norms for alcohol
  consequences in these intimate social settings'
- 'Step 4: The combination of privacy, normative perceptions, and lack of structural
  oversight leads to increased risk-taking and consequence experiences'
