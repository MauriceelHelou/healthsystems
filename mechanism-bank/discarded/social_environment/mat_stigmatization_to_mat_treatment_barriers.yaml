direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Social and institutional stigma frames MAT as ''replacing one addiction
  with another'' rather than evidence-based medical treatment'
- 'Step 2: Stigma creates reluctance among healthcare providers to offer MAT and among
  patients to seek it'
- 'Step 3: Institutional policies and cultural attitudes limit availability and acceptance
  of MAT programs'
- 'Step 4: Reduced availability and social acceptance creates structural barriers
  that prevent individuals with OUD from accessing effective pharmacotherapy'
