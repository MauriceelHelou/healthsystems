mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness creates severe psychological stress, trauma, and loss of social
  connections'
- 'Step 2: Lack of stable housing increases exposure to environments where substances
  are readily available'
- 'Step 3: Absence of routine, structure, and purpose may increase vulnerability to
  substance use'
- 'Step 4: Limited access to healthcare and support services while homeless reduces
  opportunities for prevention or treatment'

  description: Observed and unobserved personal characteristics predominantly drive
    the association, indicating that underlying vulnerabilities moderate this relationship
    more than homelessness itself directly causing substance use
