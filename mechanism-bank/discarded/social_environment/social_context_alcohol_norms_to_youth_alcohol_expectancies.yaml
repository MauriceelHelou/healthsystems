  acceptable through media, advertising, and community practices'
- 'Step 2: Youth with higher cognitive abilities process these widespread social messages
  about alcohol''s normative status'

  of positive expectancies for alcohol use'
- 'Step 4: Positive expectancies increase likelihood of alcohol experimentation during
  early adolescence'
