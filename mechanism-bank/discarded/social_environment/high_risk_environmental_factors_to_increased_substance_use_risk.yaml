direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Environmental and social risk factors create contexts of increased substance
  availability and exposure to use'
- 'Step 2: High-risk environments interact with pre-existing neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities
  to increase susceptibility'
- 'Step 3: Structural disadvantage creates stress exposure that overwhelms developing
  emotional regulatory systems'
- 'Step 4: Combined environmental risks and neurobiological vulnerabilities create
  elevated probability of substance use initiation and escalation'
