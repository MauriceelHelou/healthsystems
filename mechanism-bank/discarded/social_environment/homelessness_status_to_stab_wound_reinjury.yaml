mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Homelessness concentrates individuals in public spaces and shelters with
  high interpersonal conflict'
- 'Step 2: Lack of private, secure housing increases exposure to close-proximity altercations
  where stabbing weapons are used'
- 'Step 3: Street-level economy and survival strategies may involve dangerous interactions
  without protective barriers'
- 'Step 4: Inability to control one''s environment and avoid known threats increases
  risk of interpersonal violence with edged weapons'
