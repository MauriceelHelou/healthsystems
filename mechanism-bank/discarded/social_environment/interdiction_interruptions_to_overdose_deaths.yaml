mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Pandemic disrupts drug interdiction activities and enforcement patterns'
- 'Step 2: Changes in drug supply chains alter availability and composition of substances
  in local drug markets'
- 'Step 3: Drug supply becomes more unpredictable with increased contamination by
  high-potency synthetic opioids like fentanyl'
- 'Step 4: People who use drugs exposed to more variable and dangerous drug supplies
  face elevated overdose risk'
