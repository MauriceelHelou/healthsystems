mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Students perceive that peers approve of or are accepting of negative consequences
  in certain drinking locations'
- 'Step 2: These injunctive norms signal that experiencing consequences is socially
  acceptable or expected behavior in specific settings'
- 'Step 3: Perceived peer approval reduces personal concern about potential negative
  outcomes and removes social disincentives for risky drinking'
- 'Step 4: Students engage in higher-risk drinking behaviors consistent with perceived
  social approval, leading to increased consequences'
