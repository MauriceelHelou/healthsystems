direction: positive
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public stigma creates negative attitudes including difference, disdain,
  and blame towards individuals with AUD'
- 'Step 2: These stigmatizing attitudes lead to avoidance behaviors where community
  members withdraw from or distance themselves from individuals with AUD'
- 'Step 3: Social isolation and lack of engagement reduces opportunities for intervention
  and support'
- 'Step 4: Reduced social connection and support perpetuates untreated AUD and associated
  health consequences'
