mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Racial and ethnic minorities experience structural barriers including discrimination
  in healthcare access and quality'
- 'Step 2: These barriers lead to delayed diagnosis and reduced access to preventive
  care and early intervention for alcohol-related liver conditions'
- 'Step 3: Later stage diagnosis combined with potential differences in disease management
  results in more advanced disease at presentation'
- 'Step 4: Advanced disease stage at presentation accelerates progression through
  the natural history continuum of ALD'
