mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness create social and cultural
  barriers within Arab Muslim communities'
- 'Step 2: These stigmatizing attitudes generate fear of social rejection, discrimination,
  and shame associated with seeking mental health care'
- 'Step 3: Anticipated stigma reduces willingness to acknowledge mental health problems
  and seek professional help'
- 'Step 4: Lower help-seeking attitudes lead to delayed or avoided access to mental
  health treatment'
