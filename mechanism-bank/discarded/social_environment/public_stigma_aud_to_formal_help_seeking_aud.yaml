direction: negative
category: social_environment
mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Public stigma creates social norms that devalue individuals with alcohol
  use disorders through difference, disdain, and blame'
- 'Step 2: Anticipated stigma from formal healthcare providers reduces individuals''
  willingness to disclose alcohol problems'
- 'Step 3: Fear of social consequences and discrimination creates psychological barriers
  to accessing formal treatment settings'
- 'Step 4: Lower preference for formal help-seeking translates to reduced treatment
  utilization among those with AUD'
