direction: positive

mechanism_pathway:
- 'Step 1: Longer duration living with HIV and substance use leads to cumulative exposure
  to trauma, losses, and health complications'
- 'Step 2: Aging with HIV involves increased chronic pain, comorbidities, and medication
  side effects that may be self-managed with alcohol'
- 'Step 3: Older adults who use drugs face accumulated experiences of criminal justice
  involvement, incarceration, and social marginalization'
- 'Step 4: Age-related losses of social networks, housing stability, and employment
  opportunities reduce protective factors and social support'
- 'Step 5: Heavy alcohol use increases with age as cumulative structural disadvantage
  and reduced access to age-appropriate services compound'
