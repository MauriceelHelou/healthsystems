# Equity Analysis Template

Use this template when analyzing interventions, mechanisms, or features for equity impact.

## Equity Analysis Framework

### 1. Baseline Disparities

**Document current inequities in the outcome:**

**By Race/Ethnicity:**
- [Group 1]: [prevalence/rate]
- [Group 2]: [prevalence/rate]
- Disparity: [absolute difference] or [relative ratio]

**By Income/SES:**
- Lowest quartile: [prevalence/rate]
- Highest quartile: [prevalence/rate]
- Disparity: [absolute difference] or [relative ratio]

**By Geography:**
- Urban: [prevalence/rate]
- Rural: [prevalence/rate]
- Regional variations: [describe]
- Disparity: [absolute difference]

**Other Dimensions:**
- [Age, gender, disability, immigration status, etc.]

**Structural Context:**
Explain WHY these disparities exist in structural terms:
- Historical policies: [redlining, segregation, discriminatory lending, etc.]
- Current structural factors: [economic inequality, environmental racism, policy variation, etc.]
- Power/resource distribution: [who has access to what resources?]

**Data Sources:**
- [Census data, CDC WONDER, peer-reviewed studies, etc.]
- [Include specific citations]

---

### 2. Intervention Description

**Intervention:** [Name of intervention]

**Type:** [housing, labor, food access, healthcare, etc.]

**Scale:** [structural/institutional/individual]

**Target Population:** [Who receives the intervention?]

**Implementation:** [How is it delivered?]

**Structural Framing:**
Explain how this intervention addresses structural determinants (not individual behavior):
- Policy levers: [What policies enable this?]
- Institutional changes: [What institutions must change?]
- Resource provision: [What resources are provided?]

---

### 3. Differential Effects Analysis

**Who Benefits Most?**

Based on moderators and evidence, assess differential effects:

**By Race/Ethnicity:**
- [Group 1]: Expected effect [value, direction]
- [Group 2]: Expected effect [value, direction]
- Rationale: [Why do effects differ? Structural explanation]

**By Income/SES:**
- Low income: Expected effect [value, direction]
- High income: Expected effect [value, direction]
- Rationale: [Structural explanation - access, resources, exposures]

**By Geography:**
- Urban: Expected effect [value, direction]
- Rural: Expected effect [value, direction]
- Rationale: [Policy variation, infrastructure, etc.]

**Moderating Factors:**
List structural factors that amplify or dampen effects for specific groups:
- [Factor 1]: [Which groups affected, how, why]
- [Factor 2]: [Which groups affected, how, why]

---

### 4. Disparity Impact Calculation

**Quantify how intervention affects disparities:**

**Absolute Disparity:**
```
Baseline:
  Max prevalence: [value] (in [group])
  Min prevalence: [value] (in [group])
  Absolute disparity: [max - min]

Post-Intervention:
  Max prevalence: [value] (in [group])
  Min prevalence: [value] (in [group])
  Absolute disparity: [max - min]

Change: [increase/decrease] of [amount]
```

**Relative Disparity:**
```
Baseline:
  Ratio: [max / min]

Post-Intervention:
  Ratio: [max / min]

Change: [increase/decrease] of [amount]
```

**Disparity Reduction Percentage:**
```
Reduction = (Disparity_baseline - Disparity_post) / Disparity_baseline * 100
Result: [X]% disparity reduction
```

**Verdict:**
- [ ] **Disparity-reducing:** Intervention narrows gaps (prioritize)
- [ ] **Disparity-neutral:** Intervention maintains gaps
- [ ] **Disparity-exacerbating:** Intervention widens gaps (redesign or reject)

---

### 5. Implementation Equity Assessment

**Access & Targeting:**
- Who will actually receive this intervention?
- Are there barriers to access for marginalized communities?
- Is targeting proactive or passive (do people have to seek it out)?

**Barriers to Equitable Access:**
Identify structural barriers:
- Economic: [cost, income requirements, employment-based access]
- Geographic: [location, transportation, rural access]
- Administrative: [paperwork, documentation, bureaucratic complexity]
- Language/Cultural: [language access, cultural competence]
- Legal: [immigration status, criminal record, discrimination]

**Targeting Strategy:**
- [ ] Universal (everyone eligible)
- [ ] Targeted (specific populations)
- [ ] Proportionate universalism (universal but with intensity proportionate to need)

**Quality & Intensity:**
- Do all groups receive the same quality of intervention?
- Historical patterns: Have marginalized communities received lower-quality services?
- Safeguards: What ensures equitable quality?

**Outreach & Enrollment:**
- How will people learn about intervention?
- Is outreach proactive in marginalized communities?
- Are enrollment processes accessible (language, location, documentation)?

**Potential Harms:**
Assess unintended negative consequences, especially for marginalized groups:
- [ ] Displacement risk (gentrification, eviction)
- [ ] Surveillance/criminalization
- [ ] Stigma
- [ ] Administrative burden
- [ ] Exclusion (documentation requirements, eligibility restrictions)

**Safeguards:**
What protections are needed to prevent harm?
- [Tenant protections, privacy safeguards, universal eligibility, etc.]

---

### 6. Power & Resources Analysis

**Who Has Power?**
- Who controls implementation? [federal/state/local government, private sector, community]
- Who makes decisions about targeting and quality?
- Who can resist or undermine implementation?

**Who Has Resources?**
- Funding source: [public, private, mixed]
- Resource allocation: [formula, discretionary, competitive]
- Historical patterns: [Have marginalized communities been under-resourced?]

**Enforcement & Accountability:**
- Who enforces quality standards?
- What accountability mechanisms exist?
- Do marginalized communities have voice in oversight?

**Community Control:**
- Do affected communities have control or input?
- Is implementation community-driven or top-down?

## Common Equity Pitfalls to Avoid

**❌ AVOID:**
- "Colorblind" analysis (ignoring race)
- Biological explanations for racial disparities
- "Cultural factors" without structural context
- Assuming overall benefit = equitable benefit
- Individual blame (compliance, motivation, behavior)
- Ignoring implementation barriers
- No assessment of potential harms
- Passive targeting (assuming equal access)

**✅ INSTEAD:**
- Explicitly analyze by race with structural framing
- Structural racism explanations (redlining, discrimination, etc.)
- Cultural context within structural constraints
- Stratified analysis showing differential benefits
- Structural barriers (access, resources, power)
- Proactive implementation equity analysis
- Explicit harm assessment, especially for marginalized groups
- Active targeting and barrier reduction

## Equity-Centered Language Guide

**Use:**
- Structural racism
- Economic inequality
- Racialized exposures
- Marginalized communities
- Disparity reduction
- Structural determinants
- Policy-driven inequities
- Historical disinvestment
- Environmental racism/justice
- Proportionate universalism

**Avoid:**
- Minority (use specific groups)
- Vulnerable populations (without structural context)
- At-risk (without explaining structural risks)
- Cultural factors (alone - need structural framing)
- Health disparities (without root cause analysis)
- Achievement gap (suggests deficit)
- Underserved (better: under-resourced, divested)
